                                           Mr. P.K. Rath, Advocate
                                                            (For O.P. Nos.2 to 5)
                                    JUDGMENT
      P R E S E N T:
                         THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K. RATH
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of Hearing: 12.07.2017          │ Date of Judgment:12.07.2017
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.          This petition challenges the order dated 11.04.2016
      passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Athagarh in C.S. No.24 of
      2016, whereby and whereunder the learned trial court allowed the
      application under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC and impleaded the tenant of the
      plaintiff as defendant.
      02.            Opposite party no.1 as plaintiff instituted the suit for partition
      impleading the petitioner as well as opposite party nos.3 to 15 as
      defendants. While matter stood thus, the plaintiff filed an application
      under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC to implead the tenant over the suit premises as
      a party. The defendant nos.1,2,5 & 6 filed objection.

                                         2
03.            Learned trial court has assigned the following reasons and
allowed the application:-
               “The plaintiff wants to implead Bidyadhar Barik as one
         of the defendant in this case, since he has occupied the
         house over the suit land on the basis of rent. The citation
         relied by the counsel for the defendant has no applicability
         to this case as because in the case reported in 99(2005)
         CLT 452 the petition under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC was
         rejected and on the admission of the defendant nos.1 & 2 in
         their written statement and on other ground the Hon’ble
         Court has set aside the order of rejection of lower court.
         But in the instant case the proposed defendant is one of the
         tenant of the house existing over the suit land. For the
         interest of justice he is required to be added as a party to
         this case. So the petition under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC to
         implead Bidyadhar Barik as one of the defendant is
         allowed.”
04.            Heard Mr.B.C. Panda, learned counsel for the petitioner, Ms.
P.S. Mohanty, learned counsel for the opposite party no.1, Mr. P.K. Rath,
learned counsel for the opposite party nos.2 to 5.
05.            Mr. Panda, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in a
suit for partition, the tenant of the plaintiff is neither necessary nor proper
party to the suit. Mr. Rath, learned counsel for the opposite party nos.2 to
5, submits that a tenant of a house has no direct interest over the subject
matter of dispute.
06.            Per contra, Ms. Mohanty, learned counsel for the opposite
party no.1, supports the impugned order. She submits that the tenant is
occupying a portion of the house. She is a proper party to the suit.
07.            The question does arise as to whether a tenant is a necessary
or proper party to the suit ?
08.            Order 1 Rule 3 CPC provides thus -
               “3. Who may be joined as defendants.- All persons
               may be joined in one suit as defendants where—
               (a) any right to relief in respect of, or arising out of, the
               same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions

                                         3
               is alleged to exist against such persons, whether jointly,
               severally or in the alternative; and
               (b) if separate suits were brought against such persons,
               any common question of law or fact would arise.”
09.            The distinction between a necessary party and a proper party
is well known. In Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia-Vrs.-Additional Member
Board of Revenue, Bihar and another, AIR 1963 SC 786, the apex Court
held that a necessary party is one without whom no order can be made
effectively, a proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can
be made but whose presence is necessary for a complete and final
decision on the question involved in the proceeding.
10.            In Razia Begum-Vrs.-Sahebzadi Anwar Begum and others,
AIR 1958 SC 886, the apex Court held that it is firmly established as a
result of judicial decisions that in order that a person may be added as a
party to a suit, he should have a direct interest in the subject matter of
the litigation whether it raises questions relating to movable or immovable
property.
11.            In a suit for partition, the plaintiff is bound to implead as
defendant :
               (i) the heads of all branches;
               (ii) females who are entitled to a share on partition;
               (iii) the purchaser of a portion of the plaintiff’s share, the
               plaintiff himself being a coparcener;
               (iv)   if the  plaintiff himself  is  a  purchaser    from   a
               coparcener, his alienor. The above are necessary parties
               and if any of them is not joined, the suit is liable to be
               dismissed. The entire joint family must be represented
               either expressly or implicitly. (Article 332 of Mulla Hindu
               Law). Article 332 further provides that it is desirable that
               the following persons should be made parties; though not
               necessary parties, they are proper parties to the suit:

                                             4
                 (i)       a mortgagee with possession of the family property
                           or of the undivided interest of a coparcener;
                 (ii)      simple mortgagees of specific items of the family
                           property;
                 (iii)     purchaser of the undivided interest of a coparcener;
                 (iv)      persons entitled to provision for their maintenance
                           and marriage, i.e., widows, daughters, sisters and
                           such like and distinguished heirs;
                 (v)       any person entitled to maintenance from the family.
                 The plaintiff may also implead any other coparcener or any
                 person interested in the family property such as a
                 mortgagee or a lessee. Such a person may himself apply
                 and be made a party.”
12.              The intervenor has no direct interest over the suit schedule
land. He is neither necessary nor proper party in a suit for partition.
13.              In the wake of aforesaid, the order dated 11.04.2016 passed
by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Athagarh in C.S. No.24 of 2016 is
quashed. Learned trial court is directed to conclude the hearing of the suit
as expeditiously as possible.
                 The petition is allowed. No costs.
                                                             ……………………………….
                                                              Dr. A.K. Rath,J.
