PRESENT:
              THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE B.N. MAHAPATRA
                              Date of Judgment: 31.7.2013
B.N.Mahapatra, J.      These Writ Petitions have been filed with a prayer to issue
     appropriate writ or writs in the nature of mandamus or any other
     appropriate form directing opposite parties, including authorities of the
     State Government and opposite party No.3-OJEE to allow the member
     institutions of petitioner No.1-association with other petitioner-institutions
     to fill up 10% approved intake of their respective institutions out of the
     reserved quota B. Tech (Engineering) seats earmarked under Section 9(3) of
     the Orissa Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission
     and Fixation of Fee) Act, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act, 2007’) and
     in accordance with the principle and ratio laid down by this Court in W.P.(C)
     No. 11154 of 2012 and Writ Appeal Nos. 334 of 2012 and 74 of 2013 under
     the supervision of OJEE as well as in respect of approved intake for M. Tech
     Engineering, MCA and MBA seats out of OJEE merit list and other entrance
     examinations to be held by approved centralized agency.
     2.           Mr. S.K. Padhi, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
     petitioners referring to his written note of submission submitted that all the
     members of petitioner No.1-association including petitioner Nos.2, 3 and 4
     are coming under the definition of Private Professional Educational
     Institution as defined under Section 2(s) of the ‘Orissa Act, 2007’).
     Consequent upon the judgment delivered by the Bench consisting of eleven
     Judges of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of T.M.A. Pai Foundation

                                      3
vs. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, the All India Council for
Technical    Education     and   Training   (AICTE)    has   formulated      its
Regulations/Guidelines vide its Interim Regulation notified on 07.03.2003
in exercise of its power conferred under Section 23 read with Sections 10(b),
10(j) and 10(o) of the AICTE Act, 1987 inter alia with regard to filling up the
NRI quota seats. In paragraph-2 of the said Regulations, AICTE has
conferred ample authority on the concerned State Government to prescribe
certain percentage of seats which can be reserved for admission by the
Management of Technical Institutions in accordance with the local needs;
however, while fixing the limit of such seats it is stipulated that the same
shall not exceed 15% of the sanctioned intake. The issue relating to
NRI/Management quota seats in the case of T.M.A. Pai Foundation (supra)
had further been dealt with by two subsequent Constitution Bench of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the cases of Islamic Academy of Education and
other vs. State of Karnataka and others, AIR 2003 SC 3724 and P.A. Inamdar
and others vs. State of Maharashtra and others, AIR 2005 SC 3226. Referring
to paragraph-128 of P.A. Inamdar (supra), Mr. Padhi submitted that the
Hon’ble Supreme Court noticed that 15% NRI seats were to be filled up
depending upon the discretion of the Management subject to satisfying the
conditions as mentioned in the said judgment.
3.           Mr. Padhi further submitted that the State Government keeping
in view the aforesaid two Constitution Bench judgments of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court, i.e. Islamic Academy of Education (supra) and P.A. Inamdar

                                       4
(supra), have enacted the Act, 2007. The vires of the Orissa Act, 2007 was
challenged by the petitioner association before the Division Bench of this
Court and the same was quashed by a common judgment in the case of
Orissa Management Colleges Association vs. State of Orissa, 104(2007) CLT
310. Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court considering the State Appeals vide
C.A. Nos.2873 of 2007 and others passed interim orders on 01.06.2007 in
staying operation of Sections 4(1), 4(2), 4(4), 6(1), 6(2) and 6(3) of the Orissa
Act, 2007 with regard to constitution of Policy Planning Body (PPB) and Fee
Structure Committee (FSC) and formed the said two Committees which are
presently functioning under the Chairmanships of Hon’ble Mr. Justice K.P.
Mohapatra (Retd.) of FSC and Hon’ble Mr. Justice A.K. Parichha (Retd.). of
PPB. Pursuant to such interim orders passed by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, Section 9 of the Orissa Act, 2007 is in operation. As per the
provisions of the Act, 2007, out of total intake in Engineering Programme
not exceeding 15% seats are earmarked for NRIs, 15% seats are for AIEEE
(JEE-Main) rank holders and rest 70% seats are for O-JEE rank holder
students. In shortfall of the NRI candidates, the vacant NRI seats are to be
filled up from AIEEE and then from OJEE rank holders under Sections 9(3)
and 9(5) of the Orissa Act, 2007. From the inception of the aforesaid Act,
2007, i.e., from the academic sessions 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10 and
2010-11 and till last academic session 2011-12, 15% NRI seats and vacant
NRI quota seats were allowed to be filled up through member-institutions as
per the provisions envisaged under Section 9 of the Orissa Act, 2007.

                                       5
However, in the academic years 2011-12, the OJEE had curtailed the NRI
quota seats from 15% to 5% in its “Information Brochure 2011” and
challenging such action of OJEE 2011, W.P.(C) No. 14302 of 2011 was filed
by petitioner No.1-association before this Court and this Court granted
interim stay directing the authorities of the OJEE not to fill up the disputed
10% seats in respect of the member-institutions of petitioner No.1
association. In the last academic session 2012-13, the AICTE has issued its
“Approval Process Hand Book 2012-13” detailing procedures for admissions
of sons and daughters of Non-Resident Indian(s) vide paragraph-13 of the
said Hand Book. Paragraph-13.3 of the Hand Book 2012-13 prescribes fees
for the concerned institutions for availing the Scheme evolved by AICTE
including the manner for submission of such applications and procedure for
admission under such Scheme. However, paragraph 13.1(b) of the said
Approval Process Hand Book 2012-13 stated about provision of 5% within
the sanctioned intake for NRI category. As per paragraph 13.2 (b), in the
event of non-availability of students in NRI category, the seats would be
given to the general candidates. The PPB constituted as per the interim
orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and as per Section 4 of the Orissa Act,
2007 in its meeting held on 02.01.2012 had noticed the aforesaid provisions
of the AICTE detailed in its Approval Process Hand Book 2012-13 and
decided that the reservation of seats for NRIs should be 15% as per the
provisions of the Act, 2007. The OJEE-2012 again released its Information
Brochure for the year 2012 prescribing allocation of not exceeding 5% seats

                                         6
of the approved intake of Private Professional Educational Institutions to be
filled up by NRIs from the merit list prepared on the basis of OJEE-2012 as
per guideline of AICTE Hand Book 2012-2013 issued in this regard.
4.           It was submitted that challenging the above noted impugned
actions of the OJEE and the authorities of the State Government, the
petitioners had filed W.P.(C) No. 11154 of 2012 before this Court. The said
writ petition was allowed by the learned Single Judge holding that it is open
to the petitioner-institutions to fill up 10% of the approved intake capacity
of the institutions under the Management quota and those seats shall be
filled up from OJEE merit list under the supervision of OJEE-2012
Committee.
             Challenging the said judgment of the learned Single Judge, the
OJEE preferred writ appeals bearing W.A. Nos. 344, 371, and 373 of 2012
before the Division Bench of this Court, which were dismissed by a common
judgment dated 13.12.2012 confirming the judgment of the learned Single
Judge holding that the learned Single Judge was justified in holding that
the provisions of Section 9 of the Orissa Act, 2007 regarding Management
NRI quota in 2007 still holds the field. Another writ appeal bearing W.A.
No.74 of 2013 was filed by the OJEE before a Division Bench of this Court
and the same was also dismissed. Last year the OJEE had complied with
the direction of the aforesaid judgment passed by this Court allowing the
member institution to fill up their vacant 10% quota seats from the OJEE
rank holders under the supervision of the OJEE.

                                        7
5.           Mr. Padhi further submitted that the PPB is the apex statutory
authority in dealing with the task of admission into all technical
institutions, which in its meeting held on 01.12.2012 has unanimously
decided to follow up the principles that has been decided in the judgment of
this Court in W.A. No. 344 of 2012. However, the OJEE in violation of the
aforesaid judgment and deviation of PPB decision has again released its
Information    Brochure   without    keeping    any  provisions for  member-
institutions to fill up 10% quota seats of their respective approved intakes
as per the judgments of this Court, though the petitioner No. 1-Association
in its representation dated 16.04.2013 (Annexure-11) made request to
opposite party No. 1 and OJEE for carrying out the judgments of this Court
but the State Government and OJEE did not take any steps. In the present
writ petition, the State Government, OJEE and BPUT have filed their
respective counter affidavits reiterating their stands that had been taken by
them before this Court in the earlier W.P.(C) No. 11154 of 2012 and W.A.
No.344 of 2012. After considering the submission and the counter
submissions of all the parties, this Court passed interim dated 04.07.2013
directing the authorities of OJEE not to fill up 10% total intake of the
approved intake till disposal of the writ petition.
6.           Mr. Padhi further submitted that in the current academic
session 2013-14, there is no change in facts and circumstances as prevailed
in the last academic session 2012-13 in which learned Single Judge had
been pleased to direct the State/OJEE to allow the member-institution to fill

                                       8
up 10% approved intake of their respective institutions out of the
OJEE/AIEEE merit rank holders under the supervision of the OJEE. It was
submitted that a cumulative reading of the above referred provisions of
Section 9(2), (3) and (5) of the Orissa Act, 2007 make it clear that after
completion of the counseling by the NRI candidates from the merit list of the
OJEE, in the event of short fall the same are to be filled up resorting to the
provisions enumerated under Section 9(3) and then 9(5) of the Orissa Act,
2007. Till last academic year 2011-12, the member-institutions were
allowed to fill up such vacant NRI seats in view of Section 9(3) and (5) of the
Orissa Act, 2007 under the supervision of PPB. The reservation is not
exceeding 15% and there is no rule or guideline which empowers the State
Government to make a reservation less than 15%. The restriction of OJEE is
contrary to the statutory provisions contained in the Orissa Act, 2007 and
not in consonance with the recommendation of PPB, but only on the basis of
the AICTE Hand Book for the year 2013-14.
             It was submitted that as per the AICTE Hand Book for getting
sanction of intake of NRI of 5% an institute has to apply the Council and
there is a prescription of fee of Rs.2.00 lakh and in case of non-availability
of students of NRI, the seats shall be given to general candidates and the
general fees shall be applicable to these candidates. There is supernumerary
reservation in the AICTE Hand Book which provides for application for
supernumerary quota, for tuition fee waiver scheme, supernumerary quota
for Foreign Nationals and it is needless to say that all the provisions have

                                      9
not been adopted by the JEE nor the JEE has prescribed that for getting the
reservation of 5% of seats of NRI, the institution must make application.
None of the Private Engineering Colleges has made any application with
regard to the said NRI Scheme. This NRI scheme evolved by the AICTE has
no nexus with the State Act prescribing not exceeding 15% reservation. All
NRI candidates under the State 15% quota must appear in the JEE Test
while those opting for 5% under the said AICTE Scheme have to make
application directly to the institution without appearing JEE Test. The
Regulation of 2003 has not been superseded by the AICTE by any fresh
Regulations nor the AICTE “Approval Process Hand Book 2013-14” can
supersede a statutory Regulations. The State Act is holding the field and is
not superseded by any other Central Statutes or Rules or Regulations and
the Hand Book only contains the procedure to make applications, the
provisions of the State Act cannot be superseded. “Non-Resident Indians”
have been defined under Section 2(p) of the Orissa Act, 2007. The definition
of NRIs under the Orissa Act, 2007 is also different from the definition
prescribed in the AICTE Regulation. The State Act has two facets, i.e., one is
a PPB to supervise the entire process of admission of students and to
recommend measures to the Government and the second is the Fee
Structure Committee which will fix the fee of the institutions. Referring to
Section 7 of the Orissa Act, 2007, it is submitted that the Fee Structure
Committee (FSC) may allow such institutions to collect a higher rate of fee
from NRIs and the fee so collected over and above the fee determined for

                                         10
other students in that institution shall be utilized for awarding free-ship.
7.             Placing reliance upon the judgment of the Hon’ble       Supreme
Court in the case of in the case of P.A. Inamdar (supra), Mr. Padhi submitted
that under the concept of NRI seats and Management seats the technical
institutions have been given some leeway where they can collect higher
amount from the students which has been consistently held to be four times
above the normal fee and this higher fee of NRI is calculated for the purpose
of income of the institutions and consequently free seats and subsidiary
seats are given. It will be relevant to note here that the State itself has
notified that all Private Engineering Colleges will charge four times of the
normal fees for NRI quota seats. Section 8 of the Orissa Act, 2007 provides
for awarding free ship. The candidates admitted against NRI seats are
required to give NRI fees which is taken into consideration by the State
while computing the fees which the institution can collect from the normal
students and NRI quota students and as per the fee structure notifications,
the students admitted into the courses will continue to pay the said amount
of fee till the year 2016. It is further submitted that Notification made in the
year 2005 by the AICTE does not supersede the “Interim Regulation, 2003”
of the AICTE.
8.             Placing reliance on the judgment of Modern Dental College and
Research Centre and others v. State of M.P. and Orissa, AIR 2012 SC 1266, it
was submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in that case held that - “it is
open to the unaided professional educational institutions to fill up unfilled

                                      11
NRI seats for the year 2012-13 and for the succeeding years through the
entrance test conducted by them till the disposal of the appeal subject to
the conditions laid down in Inamdar case strictly on the basis of merits.”
9.           Further placing reliance on the order of this Court dated
31.7.2009 passed in W.P.(C) No.15532 of 2008, Mr. Padhi submitted that
this Court in that case held that “even assuming          that as a matter of
principle in accordance with the decision of the apex Court, admissions to
such technical colleges are to be given in a single window system, but in the
considered opinion    of this Court, provisions of Section 9 of the Act are
deviation from the said procedure of giving admission through a single
window, i.e., J.E.E. Counseling as the procedure provided in Section 9 of
the Act is to be adopted when contingencies mentioned therein arise after
Counseling by the JEE is completed.”
10.          Concluding his argument, Mr. Padhi submitted that issuance of
the OJEE-2013 Information Brochure under Annexure-10 containing the
impugned provisions that in a Private Professional Educational Institutions
other than minority institutions not exceeding 5% of the approved intake
may be filled up by the NRI from the merit list prepared on the basis of
OJEE -2012 as per the AICTE Approval Process Hand Book 2013-14.
Guideline issued in this regard is wholly illegal and liable to be set aside.
11.          Mr. S.S.Das, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner        in
W.P.(c) No. 14306 of 2013 while adopting the submission made in W.P.(C)
No. 13683 of 2013 agitated further following points.

                                       12
12.           Mr. Das, placing reliance on paragraph 68 of T.M.A.Pai
Foundation case (supra) submitted that the management of such institutions
need to be given sufficient discretion in admitting students such as by
allotting certain percentage of seats which can be reserved for admission by
the management out of those students who have passed the common
entrance test. Under such circumstances, the Hon’ble Supreme Court
directed the State Government to fix such percentage keeping in view the
local needs. The question of allocation of percentage regarding reservation for
NRI category as well as filing up of consequential vacant seats in the said
category has no longer been res integra. The said issue having been clarified
in clear terms by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case relating to Modern
Dental College and Research Centre and others (supra), there remains
virtually no ambiguity in dealing with the NRI quota as well as the manner in
which the consequential vacancies would be filled up.            It has been
categorically held and directed that it is open to the unaided professional
educational institutions to fill up un-filled NRI seats by themselves on the
basis of merit till the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court
finally decides the issue.
13.           Mr. Das further submitted that the interim Regulation dated
7.3.2003 of the AICTE is in force till date since the AICTE on its own
wisdom has not by any notification superseded the said Regulation and
therefore cannot absolve itself from not implementing the said regulation.
On the other hand, reservation as earmarked by the AICTE having a

                                       13
separate structural entity cannot be said to be having the over riding effect
on Section 9(3) of the State Act. In other words, the reservation as has been
codified vide Section 9(3) of the State Act is independent of the reservation
as mentioned in the AICTE Approval Process Hand Book 2013-14 regarding
intake of students in NRI category. Therefore, there cannot be any
repugnancy in the event the provision of the State Act is allowed to operate
in the said field. The quota of reservation under NRI category which has
been fixed by the State vide its Admission Brochure 2013-14 is bad in the
eye of law and the reservation under NRI category be made at 10% of the
total intake capacity of the petitioner institutions. Moreover, the vacant
seats in the NRI category be directed to be filled up at the Institution level as
per the settled principles of law.
14.          Mr.A.K.Mishra,     learned   Additional   Government      Advocate
submitted that the petitioner-association is not affected in prescribing 5%
seats under NRI quota. In last few years not a single NRI candidate has
taken admission in the petitioners’ institution. During the year under
consideration, only 187 NRI candidates appeared in OJEE-2013 out of
which 145 candidates qualified and from among them only two candidates
participated in OJEE Counseling 2013. No where in the State Act, i.e., the
Act, 2007 it has been prescribed that 15% will be provided for NRI quota.
Rather it has been prescribed that maximum up to 15% shall be provided
for NRI quota. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has kept the Act, 2007 in force
vide order dated 01.06.2007 passed in SLP No.10318 of 2007 and in three

                                        14
others. All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which is the apex
body so far as technical education is concerned prescribes in its Approval
Process Hand Book for the year 2013-14 that 5% seats within sanctioned
intake is provided for NRI category for admitting sons and daughters of
NRI(s). The State Government in a judicious manner prescribes 5% seats
under NRI quota following the provisions of the State Act and norms of
AICTE. The Odisha State Legislature in its wisdom after coming to the
conclusion that the triple tests (fair, transparent and non-exploitative) were
not satisfied by the admission procedure adopted by the private professional
institutions, has enacted the Act, 2007 and has taken over the admission
procedure and substituted it by its own procedure of admissions with the
object of securing fair and merit-based admissions and preventing
maladministration. As per the directions in para 128 in P.A. Inamdar’s
case (supra), the Policy Planning Body has adopted a centralized single
window admission procedure as envisaged in the Act, 2007. The State
Government cannot go beyond the provisions prescribed in the Act, 2007.
15.          Mr.Mishra further submitted that the petitioner-institutions
have not been debarred from collecting the approved fee prescribed for NRI
category from the candidates admitted under the said category. Seats under
NRI category cannot be compared with the vacant seats under NRI category.
The vacant seats under NRI category cannot be termed as Management
Quota Seats to be filled up at institution level in sheer violation to the
provisions of the Act, 2007. When less than 0.1% candidates are applying

                                      15
under NRI category there is no need to enhance the reservation of seats
from existing 5% to 15%. The judgment of this Court has been complied
with and the institutions have been allowed to admit students in respect of
10% seats taking candidates from OJEE-2012 and AIEEE-2012 merit list.
OJEE is the admission authority of the State Government and it can take
decisions in accordance with the direction of the Government from time to
time. OJEE-2013 cannot violate the provisions of the State Act and norms/
regulation of AICTE to satisfy the vested mala fide interest of the petitioners.
Around 30 Engineering Colleges have represented to surrender the vacant
NRI seats to OJEE-2013 for conduct of counseling. During the academic
session 2012-2013, out of total seats of 4001 available in 90 Engineering
Colleges, 10% seats for admission at institution level was provided in
pursuance of the order of this Court. Only 1566 students have taken
admission in 78 private Engineering Colleges. In 18 Colleges, admission
under the said 10% seats is nil.
16.          Mr.A.K. Mishra submitted that AICTE prescribes that 5% of
seats within sanctioned intake is provided for NRI category. The Act, 2007
prescribes that in a private professional educational institution other than
minority institution not exceeding fifteen percentum of the approved intake
may be filled up by NRI from the merit list prepared on the basis of JEE. As
per Section 3 of the Act, 2007 institutional level counseling is not allowed.
Admission of students in all private professional educational institutions,
Government institutions and sponsored institutions to all seats including

                                       16
lateral entry seats, shall be made through JEE conducted by the Policy
Planning Body followed by centralized counseling in order of merit, in
accordance with such procedure as recommended by the said body and
approved by the Government. Reservation of 15% of the intake capacity
under NRI quota may cause seat blocking exploitation of students and their
parents, dislocation in non-negotiable academic calendar of BPUT, affecting
quality etc.
17.          Mr. Palit, learned counsel appearing for the OJEE adopts the
counter filed by the State. It is submitted that only the private professional
technical institutions are entitled to give admission under the NRI quota. It
was further submitted that the NRI students as defined in Orissa Act, 2007
and AICTE Hand Book are eligible to take admission against the NRI quota.
There is no concept of management quota after the judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of P.A. Inamdar (supra).
18.          Mr. A.K. Mohapatra, leaned counsel appearing on behalf of the
BPUT submitted that the Interim Policy Regulation, 2013 of AICTE itself
specifies that the same is for a specific period of time, i.e., till final
regulation is prepared. Further it also specifies that the said interim policy
regulation is applicable to technical institutions governed by existing
regulation of AICTE. The existing regulation of AICTE, 2003 was the
regulation of 1994 amended by Regulations 1997 and 2002. The provision
of management quota not exceeding 15% has been criticized by Hon’ble

                                      17
Supreme Court in P.A.Inamdar’s case (supra). Thereafter the AICTE brought
the final regulation in 2005 in supercession of all earlier main Regulations..
After P.A. Inamdar’s case, the Government of Orissa enacted the Orissa Act,
2007. Section 9 of the State Act deals with reservation of seats for different
categories of students. Section 9(5) of the State Act provides that the vacant
seats under NRI quota shall be filled up by general category students from
OJEE merit list.
19.          Mr. Mohapatra submitted that when the statute provides for an
Act to be done in a specific manner, it is to be done in the manner provided
in it or not at all. After coming into force of AICTE Regulation, 2005 there
exists no such quota called management quota. Section 5 of the BPUT Act,
2002 provides that BPUT shall follow the Rules, Regulations, Orders,
Guidelines and directions issued by the Central Government or AICTE.
Section 3 of the Act, 2007 provides that students shall be admitted to the
institutions under BPUT through the OJEE conduced by the State
Government. It is a discretion vested in the State Government to fix a quota
to NRI students from 1% to 15% under Section 9 of the Act, 2007. Fixation
of such quota by the State Government being an academic policy decision
the scope of interference by this Court is very limited.
20.          Mr. J.K. Mishra, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of
AICTE submitted that in the Interim Policy Regulations, 2003 it was
specifically mentioned that the revision of AICTE Regulations in respect of

                                      18
fees and admission is under consideration and till the same is amended,
following Interim Regulations shall apply in supercession of existing
provisions. In excise of it’s power conferred under sub-section (1) of Section
23 read with Sections 10 and 11 of AICTE Act, 1987, AICTE is empowered
to make regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, and the
Rules, generally to carry out the purpose of this Act. AICTE being the apex
body in Technical Education at the National level, has full legal sanctity and
right to publish from time to time, the Approval Process Hand Book dealing
the procedure to process the application of the Institutions and/or
promoters in terms of Clause 4.3 of the AICTE Regulation, 2012. In this
process, AICTE has published Regulations of 2010 for the academic year
2010-11, Regulations of 2011 for the academic year 2011-12/2012-13 and
Regulations of 2012 for the academic year 2013-14 wherein keeping in view
the line of directions given by the Hon’ble Supreme court in the judgment
delivered in P.A. Inamdar’s case (supra) and more specifically paragraph 128
of the said judgment, the percentage of TFW/PIO/NRI, have been
incorporated. Since the reservations have been provided in these AICTE
Regulations, the Interim Policy Regulations dated 7.3.2003 merges with
these Regulations. Therefore, the Interim Policy Regulations, 2003 finally
merges with AICTE Regulations from 2010 onwards. It is AICTE, who has
full authority under law in framing the norms of the admissions and
reasonable stipulations to improve the standard of the Technical Education.
Therefore, Clause 4.3 of AICTE Regulations provides the power to the AICTE

                                      19
to publish Approval Process Hand Books. Fixing the percentage of NRI quota
at 5% was not a sudden decision. It was well notified earlier since February,
2012 onwards as up to now. As such there is no provision for management
quota in any of these Regulations framed by AICTE and that there cannot be
any deviation from the Act/Rule/Regulations/Guidelines/Norms of AICTE
in substituting NRI seats with Management quota seats. As a matter of
policy decision within the frame work of the provision of the Act, the new
AICTE Regulations were framed and there is no violation of Articles 14, 19,
21, 39(a) and 41 of the Constitution of India.
21.          Mr. J.K. Mishra, learned Senior Advocate submitted that        the
AICTE Act, 1987 has been suitably placed under Entry 66 of List I of the
Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, and that empowered the
Central Government for establishment of the AICTE with a view to proper
planning and coordinated development of the Technical Education System
throughout the country, the promotion of qualitative improvements of such
education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the regulation and
proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education
system and for all matters connected therewith. Since the matter pertaining
to technical education and approval of technical institution is a field covered
under the AICTE Act, ;1987, the State has no competence to take any action
in relation to any matter pertaining to either initial approval of technical
institution or extension of such approval except forwarding its views for
consideration. In support of the above contentions, Mr. Mishra relied upon

                                      20
the decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the cases of: (i) State of T.N.
and another v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute and others
(1995) 4 SCC 104; (ii) Jaya Gokul Education Trust v. Commissioner and
Secretary to Government, Higher Education Department, Thiruvanthapuram
and another, AIR 2000 SC 1614; (iii) State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. V.
S.V.Bratheep (minor) and Ors., AIR 2004 SC 1861; (iv) Govt. of A.P. and Anr.
V. J.B. Educational Society and Anr. (2005) 3 SCC 212.
22.          Mr. Mishra submitted that AICTE has received no views from
the State Government and/or any authority/ies functioning under them
with regard to fixation of any reservation quota as per the impugned Act of
2007.    For the academic session 2013-14 no Technical Institutions from
Orissa have applied for grant of approval and/or extension of approval of
their institutions as per AICTE Approval Process Hand Book relating to the
reservation quota fixed by AICTE as per its Regulations, 2012. Therefore,
Sections 9(2) and 7(b) of the Act, 2007 fixing 15% of NRI quota stand
repugnant to the AICTE Act, 1987 as well as AICTE Regulations, 2012 and
Approval Process Hand Book emanating from the AICTE Act, 1987. There is
no provision relating to reservation with regard to the management quota
seats. Modern Dental College and Research Centre and others’ case (supra)
relates to surplus NRI seats and in what manner such surplus seats are to
be allocated.    The present petitioners with their ulterior motive filed an
interim application on 31.10.2011 bearing I.A. No. 9 of 2011 in the pending
Civil Appeal No. 2873 of 2011 for issuance of an order for filling up of

                                       21
vacant NRI seats at College level counseling and as per the procedure laid
down by the Policy Planning Body and State Government. On 18.11.2011
the Hon’ble Supreme Court rejected the said prayer in limine.
23.          Paragraphs 68 to 72 in TMA Pai Foundation case (supra) were
dealt with in paragraph 122 to 135 of P.A. Inamdar case relating to
Reservation category of Management seats as well as NRI seats in the
Admission process in Technical Institutions. Para-128 in P.A. Inamdar case
is the deciding principle. Section 2(b) of State Act of 2007 defines “approved
intake” which means and implies the total number of seats sanctioned by
the competent statutory authority for admitting students in each course of
studies in a professional educational institution. Concluding his argument
Mr. J.K. Mishra submitted that grant of allocation of any NRI seat as has
been specified under the State Act would lead to repugnancy to the AICTE
Act, 1987 if it exceeds 5% so as to attract Article 246(1)r/w Article 254(1) of
the Constitution of India.
24.          On    the  rival  contentions,    the  question   that   falls for
consideration by this Court is as to whether 5% of sanctioned intake
capacity reserved by OJEE for NRI category should be enhanced to 10% of
the intake capacity so as to enable the petitioner-institutions to give
admission to more students under the NRI quota collecting higher
prescribed admission fee for the purpose of utilization of such amount for
development of the institution.

                                       22
25.          Specific stand of the petitioner-institutions is that in order to
maintain    standard/quality      of  education     by  providing    necessary
infrastructure, teaching staff etc. as required under the AICTE Act, 1987
and Regulations framed there under and for awarding free-ship, substantial
amount of money is required which cannot be met from the fees collected
from the students admitted in the general category. It is only possible if
more number of admissions will be given under NRI category so that they
can be able to maintain the standard prescribed by the AICTE Act and for
awarding free-ship. Further case of the petitioners is that Regulations, 2003
provide 15% of the intake capacity under NRI quota. The Act, 2007 also
provides that in Private Professional Educational Institutions     other than
minority institution not exceeding 15% of the intake capacity may be filled
up by NRI on the basis of the merit list prepared by the OJEE. The further
case of the petitioners is that, this Court in its judgment dated 01.10.2012
passed in W.P.(C) No. 11154 of 2012 directed the opposite parties to
earmark 10% of the intake capacity under NRI quota. In Writ Appeal Nos.
344, 371 and 373 of 2012 the Division Bench of this Court in its common
order dated 13.12.2012 has dismissed three appeals filed by OJEE and
confirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge fixing the NRI quota at
10% of the intake capacity. Therefore, it is submitted by Mr. Padhi, learned
Senior Advocate for the petitioner that this Court may not take a view
different than the view taken by the Division Bench in its decision in Writ
Appeals stated supra in respect of reservation of seats under NRI quota.

                                      23
26.         The common stand of opposite parties is that the object behind
making the provision to keep some percentage of seats reserved for NRIs is
well explained in paragraph 128 of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of P.A. Inamdar (supra). According to opposite parties,
under the NRI quota admission should be given to NRIs as defined in
Section 2(p) of the Act, 2007 and Clause 4.3 of the AICTE Hand book but
the petitioner-institutions are mis-utilizing the NRI quota by not giving
admission to NRIs as defined in Act, 2007 and AICTE Hand Book. Specific
case of the State is that in the past several years no NRI as defined under
Act, 2007 and by AICTE Regulations has taken admission. In the OJEE-
2013 only two NRI candidates have participated in the counseling under
NRI quota. The response of NRI candidates is less than 1%. The stand of
AICTE is that none of the institutions has availed 5% seats kept reserved by
AICTE under NRI quota. Thus, the opposite parties vehemently opposed
that there is no reason/justification to reserve more seats than 5% of the
approved intake capacity under NRI quota. It is further submitted that by
keeping any seat reserved under the NRI quota equal number of meritorious
candidates are deprived of getting admission in Private Professional
Technical Educational Institutions.
27.           It is not in dispute that as per the decision of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of P.A. Inamdar (supra) and the Regulations,
2003 of AICTE and Act, 2007, the seats in the Private Professional Technical

                                       24
Educational Institutions not exceeding 15% of the approved intake may be
filled up by NRI candidates from the merit list prepared on the basis of JEE.
28.          At this juncture, it would be appropriate to refer to the relevant
portion of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of P.A.
Inamdar (supra), which is quoted below:-
             “128.        Here itself we are inclined to deal with the
             question as to seats allocated for Non-Resident Indians
             ('NRI', for short) or NRI seats. It is common knowledge
             that some of the institutions grant admissions to certain
             number of students under such quota by charging a
             higher amount of fee. In fact, the term 'NRI' in relation to
             admissions is a misnomer. By and large, we have noticed
             in cases after cases coming to this Court, neither the
             students who get admissions under this category nor
             their parents are NRIs. In effect and reality, under this
             category, less meritorious students, but who can afford to
             bring more money, get admission. During the course of
             hearing, it was pointed out that a limited number of such
             seats should be made available as the money brought by
             such students admitted against NRI quota enables the
             educational institutions to strengthen its level of
             education and also to enlarge its educational activities. It
             was also pointed out that people of Indian origin, who
             have migrated to other countries, have a desire to bring
             back their children to their own country as they not only
             get education but also get reunited with Indian cultural
             ethos by virtue of being here. They also wish the money
             which they would be spending elsewhere on education of
             their children should rather reach their own motherland.
             A limited reservation of such seats, not exceeding 15%, in
             our opinion, may be made available to NRIs depending on
             the discretion of the management subject to two
             conditions. First, such seats should be utilized bona fide
             by the NRIs only and for their children or wards.
             Secondly, within this quota, the merit should not be given
             a complete go-by. The amount of money, in whatever form
             collected from such NRIs, should be utilized for benefiting
             students such as from economically weaker sections of
             the society, whom, on well defined criteria, the
             educational institution may admit on subsidized payment

                                        25
              of their fee. To prevent misutilisation of such quota or any
              malpractice referable to NRI quota seats, suitable
              legislation or regulation needs to be framed. So long as
              the State does not do it, it will be for the Committees
              constituted pursuant to Islamic Academy's direction to
              regulate.”
29.           The State Government keeping in view the judgments of
Hon’ble Suprme Court in P.A. Inamdar (supra) and Islamic Academy of
Education and others (supra) have enacted the Orissa Act, 2007. It
may be noted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court considering the State
Appeal vide C.A. No. 2873 of 2007 and others passed interim order on
1.6.2007 staying operation of sections 4(1), 4(2), 4(4), 6(1), 6(2) and
6(3) of the Orissa Act, 2007. Thus, Section 9 of the Orissa Act, 2007 is
in operation which deals with reservation of seats including NRI seats
and how to fill up the seats remained unfulfilled due to non-
availability of NRI candidates or where students out of such list leave
after selection to such seats.
30.           It may be relevant to reproduce Section 9 of the Orissa Act,
2007:
              Section 9 of the Act, 2007 reads as follows:-
              “9.(1) In every professional educational institution
              admissions shall be in accordance with the reservation
              policy of the Government notified for the purpose of this
              Act.
                     Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be
              applicable to the minority institutions.
                     (2)In a private professional educational institution
              other than minority institution not exceeding fifteen per
              centum of the approved intake may be filled up by NRI
              from the merit list prepared on the basis of JEE.

                                          26
                   (3) Where any shortfall in filling up of seats from
            NRI occurs, such vacant seats may be filled up from the
            merit list of All India Engineering Entrance Examination
            or All India Medical Entrance Examination, as the case
            may be, conducted by Central Board of Secondary
            Education.
                   Provided that while filling up such vacant seats NRI
            shall be preferred.
                   (4) In a private professional educational institution
            fifteen per centum of the approved intake may be filled up
            strictly from the merit list of All India Engineering
            Entrance Examination or All India Medical Entrance
            Examination, as the case may be, conducted by Central
            Board of Secondary Education.
                   (5) Where the seats remain unfilled due to non-
            availability of candidates in the list specified in sub-
            sections (3) and (4) or where student out of such lists
            leaves after selection to such seats, the same shall be
            filled up by the candidates belonging to the general
            category from the merit list of the JEE.
                   (6) (a) Where seats for reserved category are left
            unfilled due to non-availability of candidates from a
            particular category in the list of JEE, such seats shall be
            filled up by candidates of same category from the merit
            list of Al India Engineering Entrance Examination or All
            India Medical Entrance Examination, as the case may be,
            failing which such vacant seats shall be filled up by
            candidates not belonging to any reserved category in
            accordance with the merit list of JEE.
                      (b) If still seats remain vacant, a second JEE may
            be conducted.
                   (7)(a) In a Minority institution, not less than fifty
            per centum of the approved intake shall be filled up by
            minority students from within the State belonging to the
            minority community to which the institution belongs on
            the basis of inter se merit in the merit list of the JEE.
                        (b) The remaining seats shall be for the general
            category out of which up to fifteen per centum may be
            filled up by NRI.”
31.         Perusal of the provisions the Orissa Act, 2007 extracted above
reveals that in Private Professional Educational Institutions not exceeding

                                      27
15% of the approved intake may be filled up by the NRI from the merit list
prepared on the basis of OJEE. It further reveals that where the seats
remained unfulfilled due to non-availability of NRI candidates or where
students out of the NRI list leave after selection to such seats, the same
shall be filled up by the candidates belonging to general category from the
merit list of the JEE.
32.           For the academic year 2012-13, the State Government reduced
the aforesaid quota of reservation to 5% of the total intake capacity from
15% of the total intake. The aforesaid action of the Government was
challenged before this Court in various writ petitions including W.P.(C) No.
11154 of 2012, which was disposed of by the learned Single Judge by a
common judgment dated 01.10.2012 dealing with the issues with a
direction that it is open to the petitioner-institutions to fill up 10% of the
approved intake capacity of the institutions under the Management quota
and those seats shall be filled up from OJEE merit list under the
supervision of the OJEE 2012. The said judgment was also confirmed vide
judgment dated 13.12.2012 in W.A. No. 344 of 2012 by the Division Bench
of this Court. In view of the position indicated by the Division Bench, I
respectfully follow the same.
33.           In view of the above, this Court directs that the Private
Professional Educational Institutions can give admission from the OJEE list
to the extent permitted by interim order dated 04.07.2013, i.e., 10% of the
intake approved capacity. Further, if any seat remains vacant after giving

                                               28
admission to NRIs, the vacant seats shall be filled up from OJEE merit list
in terms of Section 9 of the Orissa Act, 2007.
34.                  The writ petitions are allowed to the extent indicated above with
the aforesaid observations and directions.
                                                           …………………………
