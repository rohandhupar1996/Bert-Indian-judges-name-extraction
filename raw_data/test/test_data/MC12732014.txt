                              BEFORE
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE T. VAIPHEI
               For the petitioner:      Mr. SB Choudhury,
                                              Advocate.
               For the respondents:     Mr. RS Chouhan,

                                        SC, Education
                  Date of Hearing:      06.08.2014
                  Date of Judgment:     22-08-2014
                         JUDGMENT & ORDER
               The question to be determined in this miscellaneous
        application is whether the interim order dated 23-5-2013
        passed by this Court in the connected writ petition is liable
        to be vacated or not?
        2.     The applicant is the respondent No. 9 in the
        connected writ petition filed by the opposite party/writ
MC No. 1273/14                                               Page 2 of 7

        petitioner (“petitioner” for short) herein. In the writ petition,
        the petitioner states that the school under the name of
        Bholabari Bagicha L.P. School was established in the year
        1985 with two teachers i.e. one Headmaster and one
        Assistant    Teacher.   The   petitioner   was   appointed      as
        Assistant Teacher by the Managing Committee of the school
        on 23-5-1985 and claims to be the founder teacher. He has
        since 1985 been regularly and continuously teaching the
        students of Bholabari Bagicha L.P. School as the Assistant
        Teacher. According to the petitioner, the Headmaster of the
        School, who is also the Secretary of the Managing
        Committee (respondent 6), keeps the attendance register
        and other documents of the school under his control and
        keeps them in his house instead of the school: the teacher
        is allowed to sign the attendance register as and when he
        likes. The petitioner was paid `4,000/- per month, and had
        received `48,000/- in the year 2009 and another `48,000/-
        in the year 2011 as Financial Assistance from the
        Government.
        3.     It is the further case of the petitioner that the
        respondent No. 6, with a view to deprive the petitioner of
        the financial assistance for the year 2011-12, which was
        already released by the Government of Assam, showed him
        absent from school despite the repeated requests made by
        him to allow him sign the attendance register as he has
        been regularly attending the school. This has been done by
        him with the intention of giving the financial assistance to
MC No. 1273/14                                                   Page 3 of 7

        the respondent No. 9; the latter has illegally received the
        financial assistance. The complaints made by him to this
        effect  to   various    authorities  including   the   District
        Elementary Education Officer, Udalguri, did not yield any
        result. On the contrary, the respondent No. 6 issued the
        letter dated 20-9-2012 terminating the service of the
        petitioner. It is the case of the petitioner that in the DISE
        Code allotted to the school also, his name was initially
        shown as the Assistant Teacher, but was subsequently
        struck off and substituted by the name of the respondent
        No. 9, who was appointed as the additional Assistant
        Teacher    only   on   10-4-1996.   Aggrieved   by   this,   the
        connected writ petition was filed by him for directing the
        respondent authorities to regularize the service of the
        petitioner   as   Assistant  Teacher    of the  school     upon
        provincialization of the school as he is the only Assistant
        Teacher in the School and has been rendering service in
        that capacity since 1985 without any break in service.
        4.     This Court by the order dated 23-5-2013 passed the
        interim order directing that no provincilzation benefits
        should be released to the respondent No. 9 until the next
        returnable date. Seeking vacation of the said interim order,
        the respondent No. 9 points out that although the
        petitioner was appointed as the 1st Assistant Teacher of the
        School on 23-5-1985, he had never attended his classes
        regularly: in fact, he had hardly attended his classes from
        2005 to 2008. He was rather working as the agent for GTF
MC No. 1273/14                                                  Page 4 of 7

        (Golden Trust of Finance) for all these years. The notices
        sent to the petitioner by the Managing Committee of the
        School from time to time for attending his classes were not
        even responded to by him.
        5.      According to the respondent No. 9, he was initially
        appointed as the 2nd Assistant Teacher of the School on 10-
        4-1996 by the Managing Committee of the School, but
        when the petitioner was regularly absent from classes, he
        came to be upgraded to the post of 1st Assistant Teacher in
        his place vide the appointment letter dated 16-2-2006
        issued by the President of the School Managing Committee;
        he has since then been regularly rendering service to the
        school till now without any break. In all the records
        maintained by the school including the DISE Code, his
        name is recorded as the 1st Assistant Teacher of the school.
        It is the case of the respondent No. 9 that in the year 2009,
        the petitioner, all of a sudden, appeared out of nowhere and
        forcibly tried to attend the classes in order to receive the
        financial assistance meant for the 1st Assistant Teacher. He
        even    went   to  the    extent of   threatening  the  school
        authorities that if he was not allowed to resume his duties,
        he would poison the food stuff of the children/pupil, for
        which an FIR was lodged with the Officer-in-Charge of
        Kalaigaon Police Station on 31-9-2012. A public petition to
        that    effect  was    also   submitted   before  the  District
        Elementary Education, Udalguri (BTAD), Assam, which is
        still pending. It is the contention of the respondent No. 9
MC No. 1273/14                                                 Page 5 of 7

        that the petitioner, by suppressing of the above facts and
        by playing fraud upon this Court, and has even, ipso facto,
        managed to obtain the interim order, which is, therefore,
        liable to be vacated.
        6.     On a comparative reading of the pleadings of the
        parties and the documents annexed to their respective
        pleadings, it is quite apparent at this stage that the writ
        petitioner from service in terms of the resolution dated 16-
        2-2009 passed by the Managing Committee of the school
        and that ever since 28-2005, the Managing Committee had
        been noting the regular absence of the writ petitioner from
        the school vide the resolutions dated 28-5-2005, 12-8-2005
        and 12-7-2007. Resolution No. 1 dated 15-9-2012 of the
        Managing Committee of the School also noted the threat
        made by the writ petitioner over mobile even after his
        removal from service and of his attempt to forcibly enter the
        school premises to resume teachings in the school thereby
        disturbing the school atmosphere, etc., for which an ejahar
        was immediately lodged with Kalaigaon PS. On the other
        hand, vide Annexure-D series, it can be seen that the name
        of the applicant is recorded in the DISE Code for the year
        2009-2010. However, there is nothing on record to show at
        this stage that the writ petitioner was ever reinstated to the
        post of 1st Assistant Teacher after his removal from service
        on 12-6-2009. As the writ petitioner, in the face of denial by
        the respondents and the applicant, the burden of proof is
        upon him to establish that he was reinstated to his post
MC No. 1273/14                                                 Page 6 of 7

        after 12-6-2009. Stay order is granted to a party on his
        showing sufficient materials for making out a prima facie
        case in the first place. Apart from making bare statement
        that he is the 1st Assistant Teacher of the school without
        any materials to substantiate his claim, the question of
        granting interim order to him does not arise. This Court
        had earlier issued the interim order in question when it had
        not been acquainted with the version of the applicant. In
        this view of the matter, the interim order has no reason for
        its continuance and, is, therefore, liable to be vacated.
        7.     For  the   reasons    stated  in   the  foregoing,   this
        miscellaneous application is allowed. The interim order
        dated 23-5-2013 passed by this Court in the connected writ
        petition is hereby recalled. Nothing stated in the foregoing
        shall, however, be construed as final observations on the
        merit of the writ petition, which is yet to be fully heard. The
        provincialization of the service of the Applicant as 1st
        Assistant Teacher Bholabari shall, however, be made
        subject to the outcome of the connected writ petition.
