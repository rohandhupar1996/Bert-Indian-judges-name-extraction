                                      JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
                       Having heard Mr. P.K. Das, the learned counsel for the
                petitioner, and Mr. U.K. Goswami, the learned standing counsel for
                the Education (Elementary) Department, Assam, I am of the view
                that there is no merit in this writ petition, which is liable to be
                dismissed. But, the facts of the case may be briefly noticed at the
                outset. The petitioner has the qualification of M.Sc. with B.Ed
                degrees and applied for Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET) Examination
                in response to the advertisement dated 21-12-2013, and appeared
                in the Examination on 8-2-2014, the result whereof was declared
                on 18-2-2014. However, his roll number was included among the
                list  of   disqualified   candidates   on   the   ground    of  wrong
                selection/marking of parts in the answer sheet of Paper II (Option-
                B). He immediately filed an application under the Right to
                Information Act, 2005 on 1-3-2014, but the information so
                furnished was not satisfactory whereupon he approached this Court
                in WP(C) No. 3560 of 2014 to redress his grievance This Court by
                the order dated 25-7-2014 disposed of the writ petition by directing
                the petitioner to take recourse to the alternative statutory remedy of
                appeal available to him under the law. At this stage, it may be noted
                that there are two papers for the TET examination. Paper-I was
                common to all whereas Paper-II had Option B with four Parts
                namely, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. Out of these
                four parts, the petitioner opted for Chemistry and Biology. What
                had happened is that the petitioner marked not only Chemistry and
                Biology parts but even went to the extent of marking the Physics
                part. This prompted the respondents to disqualify him as a
                candidate for the TET examination. One of the instructions of the
                Test Booklet is in the following terms:
                       “A candidate has to answer only two parts out of four
                       parts. Each part has 50 questions of 1 mark each. Any
WP(C) No.4159/2014                                                                    Page 2 of 3

                       candidate answering more than two parts will be
                       disqualified.”
                2.     Even a cursory look at the foregoing instruction will plainly
                show that a candidate cannot answer more than two out of the four
                parts, and any transgression of such instruction would incur
                disqualification. In the instant case, the petitioner has admittedly
                opted for Chemistry and Biology parts and did not opt for Physics
                part. Yet, he marked in the circle of the box meant for Physics part
                in addition to Chemistry and Biology parts in contravention of the
                Instruction of the Test Booklet by mistake or otherwise. Even if it
                was due to inadvertence also, there appears to be no provision for
                condoning such inadvertence inasmuch as the clear terms of the
                Instruction in question negates the existence of any discretion.
                Moreover, it is a competitive examination where the rule of survival
                of the fittest prevails. I understand it is a costly mistake with
                disastrous consequence for the petitioner, but then hardship or
                inconvenience or the consequences thereof cannot be a ground for
                the interference of this Court unless violation of his legal or
                constitutional right resulting therefrom is made out by the
                petitioner.
                3.     For the reasons stated in the forgoing, there is no merit in
                the writ petition, which is, accordingly, dismissed. However, the
                parties are directed to bear their respective costs.
                                                                      JUDGE
