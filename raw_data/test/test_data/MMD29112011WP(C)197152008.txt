                                               --------------------------
          PRESENT:
                               THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M. M. DAS
          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. DAS, J.                   As all the above three writ applications arise out of
          common election petitions and involve common questions of fact, they
          were heard together and are being disposed of by this common
          judgment.
          2.                   In the three tier Panchayati Raj Election of the year
          2007, Champa Pujari, petitioner in W.P.(C) No.19715 of 2008, was
          elected as Member of Jharigam Panchayat Samiti from Banuaguda
          Panchayat Samiti constituency and the opposite party no.1 Manju
          Majhi in the said writ application was elected as Member to the said
          Panchayat Samiti from Kanakote Panchayat Samiti constituency. The
          above two candidates contested the election for the office of the
          Chairperson of the said Jharigam Panchayat Samiti and Manju Majhi
          was elected as the Chairperson.
          3.                   The petitioner Kunti Majhi in W.P.(C) No.19750 of
          2008, who contested the election to be elected as Member, Panchayat
          Samiti from Kanakota Panchayat Samiti constituency with Manju
          Majhi, filed an election petition under Section 44 (B) of the Orissa
          Panchayat Samiti Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) before

                                   3
the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Nabarangpur registered as
Election Petition No.7 of 2007 with a prayer to declare the election of
Manju Majhi as Member of the Panchayat Samiti to be invalid, on the
ground that Manju has more than two children and one of such child
was born after the cut off date and thus, she was disqualified to
contest the said election. Champa Pujari, who contested the election
to the office of the Chairperson with Manju and was defeated,
challenging the said election of Manju to the office of the Chairperson
on the same ground that she was disqualified to hold the office of the
Chairperson having a third child born after the cut off date, filed
Election Petition No.16 of 2007 before the learned Civil Judge (Senior
Division), Nabarangpur for declaring the election of Manju as
Chairperson to be invalid and to declare herself as elected to the office
of the Chairperson of the Panchayat Samiti, she being the only other
contesting candidate.
4.              Both the election petitions were heard together by the
learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Nabarangpur and by a common
judgment dated 06.08.2008, the Election Tribunal came to the
following conclusion :-
                “In view of my findings made in Issue No.2, it
             can safely be said at this stage that the
             declaration of O.P.-Manju as returned candidate
             both for the post of Panchayat Samiti member as
             well as Chair-person is void. There being only two
             persons in El.P. No.16/07 there is no embargo to
             declare petitioner thereof as elected chair person.
             In other Election Petition though more than two

                                   4
            persons were there in election fray still all opp.
            parties incurring dis-qualification, petitioner
            though not secured highest number of votes still
            remaining as only valid contesting candidate, she
            is declared as elected for the post of Panchayat
            Samiti member of Kanakote Panchayat Samiti
            constituency. (2005(I)OLR-(SC)26, 1968-Vol.34-
            C.L.T. – 53 relied)……...”
5.              Upon coming to the above conclusion, the Election
Tribunal passed the following order:-
                “Both the election petitions are allowed but
            without cost. Election Petition No.7/2007 is
            allowed on contest against O.P. No.1, on
            admission against O.P. No.2 and ex parte against
            O.P. No.3.
                Declaration of O.P. No.1 as returned candidate
            as Panchayat Samiti Member of Kanakote
            Panchayat Samiti constituency to Jharigam
            Panchayat Samiti is declared as void. The
            petitioner is declared as duly elected as Panchayat
            Samiti member of said Panchayat Samiti
            U/sec.44-N – Orissa Panchayat Samiti Act, 1959.
                Election Petition No.16/2007 is allowed on
            contest against the opp. party.
                Declaration of opp. party as returned
            candidate as Chair-person of Jharigam Panchayat
            Samiti is declared as void. The petitioner of said
            case is declared as duly elected as Chair-person of
            said Panchayat Samiti.”
6.              Manju Majhi, being aggrieved, filed two separate
election appeals against the aforesaid common judgment passed in
both the election petitions before the learned District Judge, Koraput
at Jeypore, which was registered as Election Appeal Nos. 15 and 16 of
2008, Election Appeal No. 15 of 2008, being against the judgment
passed in Election Petition No.16 of 2007 and Election Appeal No.16
of 2008 being against the judgment in Election Petition No.7 of 2007.

                                   5
7.              The learned District Judge, also, by a common
judgment dated 16.12.2008, disposed of both the election appeals by
setting aside the common judgment passed by the Election Tribunal
and remitting the election petitions back to him for fresh adjudication.
8.              In the interregnum, basing on the original judgment
passed by the learned Election Tribunal, the Collector, Nabarangpur
issued a Notification on 24.01.2009 declaring Kunti Majhi and
Champa     Pujari  to  be   elected   Member    and    the  Chairperson
respectively of Jharigam Panchayat Samiti and directed the Block
Development Officer, Jharigam to undertake the process of giving and
taking of charge of the respective offices. Manju Majhi, whose election
was declared void by the Election Tribunal and the said judgment was
set aside by the appellate court and the matter was remitted back to
the Election Tribunal for fresh disposal, has filed W.P.(C) No.1377 of
2009 challenging the said action of the Collector and the Block
Development Officer. The common judgment passed in both the
election appeals by the learned District Judge, remanding the matter
back to the Election Tribunal, has been challenged in both the W.P.(C)
Nos. 19715 and 19750 of 2008 .
9.              On perusal of the common judgment passed by the
learned District Judge in Election Appeal Nos. 15 and 16 of 2008,
which is impugned in W.P.(C) Nos.19715 and 19750 of 2008, it
appears that during the pendency of the appeal, the appellant Manju

                                    6
Majhi in both the appeals, filed an application under Order – 41, Rule
– 27 C.P.C. for admitting a document as additional evidence in
support of the pleal that Kunti Majhi, who has been declared to be
elected, as Member, Panchayat Samiti from Kanakote Panchayat
Samiti constituency was ineligible to contest the election having a
third child born after the cut off date. An application under Order – 6,
Rule – 17 C.P.C. was also filed by the said appellant Manju Majhi
seeking amendment of her pleading to the above effect.
10.              The learned appellate court came to the conclusion
that if the petitions under Order – 41, Rule – 27 and Order – 6, Rule –
17 C.P.C. merit consideration the matter has to be remitted back to
the learned Election Tribunal. If not, the common judgment of the
learned Election Tribunal has to be scrutinized to find out whether
the said judgment can be sustained or not. Thus, framing the above
two questions, the learned lower appellate court, while addressing
itself to the question of admission of additional evidence, came to the
conclusion that if Kunti, who has been declared as elected Member, is
found to be ineligible to hold the office of the Member, Panchayat
Samiti, the order declaring her to be elected as Member, cannot be
sustained and, therefore, the said document is required to be
examined by the learned Election Tribunal. Thus holding, as already
stated above, the learned lower appellate court set aside the common
judgment passed in both the election petitions and remitted the

                                     7
matter back to the learned Election Tribunal with the following
directions :-
                 “In the result both the appeals are allowed on
              contest but without cost. The impugned order is
              set aside. The Election Petitions are remanded to
              the court below for fresh adjudication. If the
              appellant files petition under Order 6 Rule 17 of
              the C.P.C. and files documents opportunity
              should be given to the other side to arrive at a just
              and proper conclusion. Parties are directed to
              remain present in the court below on 24-12-2008
              to receive further instruction. The court below is
              directed to dispose of the elections petitions
              within three months.”
11.              However, the learned lower appellate court has not
addressed itself to the question as to whether Champa Pujari, who
was declared to be elected to the office of the Chairperson of the
Panchayat Samiti, could have been declared as such by the learned
Election Tribunal, which was the subject matter of the Election
Appeal No.15 of 2008.
12.              As the learned Election Tribunal held that Manju
Majhi was not eligible to be elected as Member of the Panchayat
Samiti and on that ground, she was not eligible to contest the election
for the office of Chairperson of the Panchayat Samiti, in her place
declared Kunti Majhi to be the elected Member. The learned Election
Tribunal could not have declared Champa Pujari to be the elected
Chairperson in the absence of the Member from Kanakote Panchayat
Samiti constituency. The Chairperson of the Panchayat Samiti is
elected by the elected members of the Panchayat Samiti. Therefore, if

                                    8
there is a dispute with regard to the membership of one of the
members involved in an election petition, unless the same is finalized
and in the event, the election of the elected Member is declared to be
null and void and a fresh       election is held, another Member, who
contested for the post of Chairperson, cannot be declared elected as
Chairperson, where the election of the elected Chairperson whose
election as Member of the Panchayat Samiti has been held to be null
and void.
13.               No error apparent on the face of the judgment of the
learned lower appellate court is found by this Court except that the
learned lower appellate court could not have held that there was
scope for filing of a counter claim by Manju Majhi. Nevertheless, when
the learned Election Tribunal is competent to declare either the
election petitioner or any other contestant, who secured maximum
number of votes as elected in the event the election of the elected
candidate is declared null and void, the learned Election Tribunal is
required to find out as to whether such person, who is to be declared
as elected, was eligible to hold the office in question.
14.               This Court, therefore, also finds no perversity or
illegality in the impugned order passed by the learned lower appellate
court. Hence, W.P.(C) Nos.19715 and 19750 of 2008 being devoid of
merit stand dismissed.

                                    9
 15.             With regard to W.P.(C) No.1377 of 2009 filed by Manju
 Majhi, it is found that in view of the judgment of the learned lower
 appellate court setting aside the common judgment passed by the
 learned Election Tribunal and remitting the matter back to him, the
 Collector, Nabarangpur could not have issued the notification dated
 24.01.2009 declaring Kunti Majhi as the elected Member from
 Kanakote Panchayat Samiti constituency and Champa Pujari as the
 Chairperson of Jharigam Panchayat Samiti. Thus, the Collector,
 Nabarangpur could not have directed the Block Development Officer,
 Jharigam to undertake the process of giving and taking of charge of
 the respective offices. The said notification dated 24.01.2009 issued
 by the Collector, Nabarangpur pursuant to the common judgment
 passed by the learned Election Tribunal, which has been ultimately
 set aside by the learned lower appellate court, therefore, cannot be
 sustained and, is, accordingly quashed. The Collector, Nabarangpur is
 directed to restore the status quo ante till disposal of both the election
 petitions by the learned Election Tribunal, which have been remitted
 back to him by the learned lower appellate court.
 16.             In the result, therefore, W.P.(C) No.1377 of 2009
 stands allowed. All the pending Misc. Cases stand disposed of.
                                                …………………….
