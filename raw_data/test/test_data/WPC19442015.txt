              The three cases were heard together on 13.08.2015 and
today is fixed for delivery of judgment.

petitioner in WP(C) No. 1944/2015 and Mr. B. D. Konwar, learned
Sr. Counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) Nos. 3515/2015 and
3826/2015. Also heard Mr. P. Roy, learned Addl. Advocate General,

WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                        Page 4 of 31

WP(C) No. 1944/2015 is also the respondent No. 3 in the other two
cases.
3.                The litigation was initiated by filing of WP(C) No.
1944/2015. Initially, challenge was made to the transfer of the
petitioner from Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati to
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Medical College and Hospital, Barpeta. In
the course of the proceedings of WP(C) No. 1944/2015, a related
issue of considerable importance, namely, filling up of the post of
Director of Medical Education (DME), Assam surfaced and taken
note of by the Court whereafter the other two writ petitions came to
be filed.
4.                At the outset, the factual narration and the orders
passed by the Court from time to time may be briefly noticed.
5.                Since WP(C) No. 1944/2015 was filed prior in point of
time and is the leading case, reference may be made to the facts of
the said case.
6.                Petitioner is serving as Principal of Gauhati Medical
College      and      Hospital.      According to the petitioner,  following
extension of service of senior faculty members upto the age of 65
years in the medical colleges, he is continuing in service beyond the
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                              Page 5 of 31

age of 62 years. Presently, he is on the verge of superannuation as
he has hardly about 5 months left to retire.
7.                Four notifications, all dated 01.04.2015, were issued by
the Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Health and Family
Welfare        Department.            By   notification    No.HLB.76/2015/13,
respondent           No.      3,     then   serving    as    Principal-cum-Chief
Superintendent,           Fakhruddin       Ali  Ahmed     Medical    College       and
Hospital, Barpeta was transferred to and posted as Principal-cum-
Chief Superintendant at Assam Medical College and Hospital,
Dibrugarh with effect from the date of taking over charge vice
respondent No. 4 i.e. Prof. (Dr.) Atindra Kr. Adhikari, who was
holding the post of Principal-cum-Chief Superintendent, Assam
Medical College and Hospital, Dibrugarh. In the second part of the
said notification, it was stated that respondent No. 3 will hold
current charge of Director of Medical Education, Assam vice Prof.
(Dr) Dhruba Jyoti Borah, Director of Medical Education, Assam and
Principal-Cum-Chief Superintendant, Assam Hills Medical College
and Research Institute, Diphu relieved vide notification No.
HLB.76/2015/14                dated     01.04.2015.     Vide    notification       No.
HLB.76/2015/15, petitioner was transferred in the same capacity
and posted as Principal-cum-Chief Superintendant at Fakhruddin
Ali Ahmed Medical College and Hospital, Barpeta with effect from
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                     Page 6 of 31

the date of taking over charge vice respondent No. 3 i.e. Prof. (Dr)
Bhabani Prasad Chakravarty, transferred as above. By another
notification bearing No. HLB.76/2015/16, respondent No. 4 was
transferred to and posted as Principal-cum-Chief Superintendant at

taking over charge vice the petitioner i.e. Prof. (Dr.) Kabul Ch. Saikia
transferred as above. By the 4th notification No. HLB. 76/2015/17
Prof. (Dr.) Ratan Kumar Kotoki (respondent No. 5) of Assam Medical
College and Hospital, Dibrugarh was posted as in-charge Principal-
Cum-Chief Superintendant, Assam Medical College and Hospital,
Dibrugah with all financial powers with effect from the date of
taking over charge vice respondent No. 4 i.e. Prof. (Dr.) Atindra Kr.
Adhikari transferred as above.
8.                Aggrieved by his transfer from Gauhati Medical College
and Hospital, Guwahati to Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Medical College
and Hospital, Barpeta at the fag end of his service career, petitioner
has instituted the present proceeding.
9.                On 02.04.2015, this Court had passed the following
order:-
                                     “Petitioner is the Principal -cum- Chief
                  Superintendent of Gauhati Medical College & Hospital (GMCH).
                  He is aggrieved by the impugned notification No. HLB.76/2015/15,
                  dated 01.04.2015, transferring and posting him in the same capacity
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                      Page 7 of 31

                  as Principal-Cum- Chief Superintendent of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed
                  Medical College & Hospital, Barpeta.
                          Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has referred to
                  similar notifications issued on the same date in respect of
                  respondent Nos. 3 and 4. He submits that respondent No. 3, who is
                  the Principal -cum- Chief Superintendent of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed
                  Medical College & Hospital, Barpeta, is being transferred to Assam
                  Medical College & Hospital, Dibrugarh, as Principal -cum-Chief
                  Superintendent, but in addition, he has also been given current
                  charge of Director of Medical Education, Assam. Respondent No. 4,
                  who is presently the Principal at Dibrugarh, is being transferred to
                  Guwahati. Respondent No. 5 is being posted as in-charge Principal
                  at Dibrugarh. He submits that the entire exercise has been carried
                  out to make the respondent No. 3 the Director of Medical Education
                  without going through regular selection. Learned Senior Counsel
                  has referred to the provisions of Assam Medical Education Service
                  Rules, 2008, particularly Rule-3 and Schedule-I thereof, to contend
                  that the post of Director of Medical Education is above the post of
                  Principal -Cum- Chief Superintendent. Without appointing the
                  Director of Medical Education in accordance with the Rules, this
                  procedure has been adopted to favour the respondent No. 3, which
                  is not at all in conformity with the mandate of the Rules.
                  Additionally, he submits that petitioner will superannuate from
                  service in December, 2015, i.e., less than 9 (nine) months
                  remaining. At the fag end of his service career, subjecting him to
                  such a hasty transfer is not warranted. He finally submits that
                  petitioner has not yet handed over charge at Guwahati.
                          Mr Choudhury, learned Standing Counsel submits that it is a
                  routine transfer and nothing more should be read into it. Petitioner
                  is being transferred from Guwahati to Barpeta and no prejudice will
                  be caused to him.
                          Mr K Agarwal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent
                  No. 3, submits that his client has already handed over charge at
                  Barpeta and joined as Director of Medical Education.
                          Mr P Pathak, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent No.
                  4, however, submits that he does not have any instruction about
                  handing over and taking over of charge by the respondent No. 4, but
                  contends that no interference is warranted in such a routine transfer
                  matter.
                          A perusal of the impugned notification issued on 01.04.2015
                  (Annexure-B) will show that the transfer of the petitioner to Barpeta
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                        Page 8 of 31

                  will be effective from the date of his taking over charge at Barpeta
                  vice respondent No. 3, who has been transferred to Dibrugarh and
                  also given the current charge of Director of Medical Education.
                  Admittedly, petitioner has not taken over charge from respondent
                  No. 3 at Barpeta. Therefore, the transfer order of the petitioner has
                  not yet become effective. On the other hand, in less than 24 hours,
                  respondent No. 3 has joined as Director of Medical Education,
                  Assam, though he has not joined the office of the Principal-cum-
                  Chief Superintendent, Assam Medical College & Hospital,
                  Dibrugarh. Prima-facie, allowing the respondent No. 3 to discharge
                  dual functions as Principal at Dibrugarh and as Director of Medical
                  Education, Assam, at Guwahati, i.e., in two different stations at
                  considerable distance apart, appears to be quite unusual. Another
                  question which may arise for consideration is whether without
                  taking over charge as Principal-cum-Chief Superintendent of Assam
                  Medical College & Hospital at Dibrugarh, can respondent No. 3
                  take over current charge as Director of Medical Education, which
                  appears to be an additional charge?
                          In view of above, Court would like to peruse the relevant file
                  relating to the entire transfer exercise as seen above.
                          Let the learned Standing Counsel produce the relevant file
                  on 08.04.2015.
                          Till then, impugned notification No. HLB.76/2015/15 dated
                  01.04.2015 (Annexure-B), shall remain stayed.”
10.               On 08.04.2015, learned Standing Counsel produced the
relevant file. The file was perused and thereafter the following order
was passed on 10.04.2015:-
                  “       On perusal of the file, it is seen that a departmental note was
                  put up on 14.02.2015 stating that Dr. DJ Bora, DME had informed
                  that he has been elected as President of Asom Sahitya Sabha and,
                  therefore, he would like to be relieved from that post. The note
                  further discloses that three applications were received from three
                  faculty members submitting their candidature for the post of
                  Director of Medical Education (DME).
                          From a perusal of the applications, it is seen that the
                  applicants had stated that they had come to know from reliable
                  source, that the post of DME was going to fall vacant within the next
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                          Page 9 of 31

                  few days and therefore they had submitted the applications. There is
                  nothing in the file to show that any advertisement was issued or that
                  any invitation was extended by the Department inviting such
                  applications.
                          On 26.03.2015 Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Govt.
                  of Assam passed the following order in the note sheet: -
                          “          Dr. Dhruba Jyoti Borah is relieved of the charges of
                          Director, Medical Education and Dr. Bhabani Prasad
                          Chakraborty, Principal FAAMC is appointed as Director,
                          Medical Education.
                          Dr. KC Saikia, Principal, GMC is transferred and posted at
                          FAAMC, Barpeta in the same capacity and Dr. A Adhikari,
                          Principal, AMC is transferred and posted at GMC in the
                          same capacity.
                                     Dr. Ratan Kr. Kotoky, Professor of Medicine, AMC is
                          appointed as Principal, AMC.
                          Issue orders.
                                                   Minister, H&FW.”
                          From a reading of the above, it is clear that the
                  departmental Minister had passed the order appointing respondent
                  No. 3 as DME. In the second part of the said order, it was ordered
                  that petitioner is transferred to Barpeta and respondent No. 4 is
                  transferred from Dibrugarh to Guwahati. It was also ordered that
                  respondent No.5 is appointed as Principal of Assam Medical
                  College & Hospital, Dibrugarh. Though modification of the above
                  order was sought for by the Principal Secretary, the departmental
                  Minister in his order dated 30.03.2015 in the note sheet reiterated
                  his earlier order. Thereafter the note sheet indicates that the
                  departmental authorities suggested that the post of DME is to be
                  filled up by way of direct recruitment through the Assam Public
                  Service Commission (APSC). In this connection, it was further
                  suggested that respondent No.3 can be allowed to be the in-charge
                  DME only, and for that purpose, a substantive post was required for
                  respondent No. 3 for the purpose of salary. Therefore, it was
                  suggested that respondent No.3 be transferred to Dibrugarh, since
                  respondent No.4 was proposed to be transferred to Guwahati.
                          It is in this background that the impugned order came to be
                  issued.
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                          Page 10 of 31

                          Thus from a perusal of the file, a related issue of critical
                  importance has surfaced, namely, filling up of the post of DME,
                  since it was for the purpose of filling up of the said post that the
                  impugned order came to be issued.
                          The Assam Medical Education Service Rules, 2008 has been
                  framed in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article
                  309 of the Constitution of India. As per Rule 3, DME, the actual
                  description of the post being Director of Medical Education,
                  Planning & Research, is a Class-1 (Senior Grade) cadre which has
                  been placed above the cadre of Principal-cum-Chief Superintendent
                  of Medical Colleges/Addl. Director of Medical Education. As per
                  Rule 5, recruitment to the post of Director is to be made by way of
                  direct recruitment through the APSC by following the procedure. As
                  per Rule 7, to be eligible for the post of Director, a candidate must
                  be in the age group of 45 to 55 years. As per Schedule-III appended
                  to the Rules, for holding the post of DME, a candidate should
                  possess basic university medical qualification and 10 years of
                  teaching experience as Professor/Associate Processor in a Medical
                  College, out of which atleast 6 years should be as Professor or in a
                  post of equivalent rank. The candidate should also have adequate
                  number of publications to his/her credit.
                          Therefore, from the Rules, it is evident that the post of DME
                  is required to be filled up by way of direct recruitment through the
                  APSC from amongst the candidates having the eligibility criteria as
                  mentioned in the Rules.
                          In such circumstances, confining the selection to only the
                  three applicants, who had submitted applications without any
                  advertisement or invitation by the Department to the exclusion of all
                  other eligible candidates, would not be justified.
                          To clear the above position, Court is of the view that the
                  Principal Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Health & Family Welfare
                  Department should file an affidavit stating as to how the
                  Department proposes to fill up the vacancy in the post of DME
                  keeping in view the mandate of the Rules as noticed above. Let the
                  said affidavit be filed within a period of 2 weeks from today.
                          Issue notice.
                          Notice may be issued to respondent Nos. 1 to 4 only at this
                  stage.
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                         Page 11 of 31

                          Since the parties are already before the Court, no formal
                  notice need be issued.
                          In the meanwhile, the interim order passed by this Court on
                  02.04.2015 shall continue until further order(s).
                          However, respondents may make arrangement to provide
                  salary to the respondent No.3, since he has admittedly joined the
                  post of DME, though as noticed in the order dated 02.04.2015, the
                  validity of such joining is questionable.”
11.               Thus it can be seen from the above that while
examining the challenge of the petitioner to his transfer, the issue of
filling up of the post of DME came to light which was noticed by this
Court in the order dated 10.04.2015. From a reading of the order
dated 10.04.2015 it transpires that holding of charge of the Office of
DME by the respondent No. 3 was central to all the notifications
issued contemporaneously. This Court also noticed the provisions of
Assam Medical Education Service Rules, 2008 (2008 Rules)
including those provisions relating to appointment of DME in the
light of the facts noticed in the order dated 10.04.2015. Principal
Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Health and Family Welfare
Department was directed to file an affidavit indicating as to how the
Department proposed to fill up the vacancy in the post of DME
having regard to the mandate of the 2008 Rules.
12.               An affidavit was filed on behalf of respondent No. 1 on
29.04.2015. In the said affidavit it was pointed out that having
regard to the eligibility criteria prescribed for the post of DME vis a
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                      Page 12 of 31

vis the posts of Professor/Associate Professor, the latter would be in
a   disadvantageous              position   having     regard     to    the   minimum
qualification, the age of superannuation and pay scale. For such
disparity, the post of DME has not received attention from the
eligible candidates. Therefore, the Department has been constrained
to fill up the post of DME by way of stop-gap arrangement. It was
further stated that necessary steps were being taken by the
Government to amend the 2008 Rules for which some time would be
required. Till the amendments are made and recruitment carried
out as per the amended Rules, respondents should be permitted to
continue with the present adhoc/stop-gap arrangement since the
post of DME is the administrative head of all the medical colleges
and other health institutions of the State.
13.               This Court expressed its displeasure over the contents
of the affidavit filed and passed the following order on 05.05.2015:-
                  “       A perusal of the affidavit indicates that the stand taken by the
                  Principal Secretary is that the Assam Medical Education Service
                  Rules, 2008 requires amendment as because Professors/Associate
                  Professors would be in a disadvantageous position while applying
                  for the post of Director of Medical Education in view of disparity in
                  the superannuation age and pay scale between the said post and that
                  of Professor. For such disparity, post of Director of Medical
                  Education has not received attention from the eligible candidates as
                  per the aforesaid Rules. Therefore, the Department has been
                  constrained to fill up the said post by way of stop gap arrangement.
                          The affidavit filed does not indicate that any serious
                  attention was given by the Principal Secretary to the order of this
                  Court dated 10.04.2015. In view thereof and particularly in view of
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                          Page 13 of 31

                  the stand taken in para 4 of the affidavit as noticed above, Court is
                  of the view that filing of a supplementary affidavit is called for.
                          At this stage, it has been submitted at the Bar that since the
                  year 2002, the post of Director of Medical Education has not been
                  filled up on regular basis.
                          In view of above, the Principal Secretary should file a
                  supplementary affidavit which should contain the following: -
                          i) Since coming into force of the Assam Medical Education
                          Service Rules, 2008, how many Directors of Medical
                          Education have been appointed?
                          ii) What was the procedure followed while making such
                          appointments?
                          iii) How many eligible candidates had applied for the post of
                          Director of Medical Education after coming into force of the
                          aforesaid Rules?
                          iv) Whether vacancy arising in the post of Director of
                          Medical Education was ever notified by way of
                          advertisement etc.?
                          v) How the post of Director of Medical Education has been
                          filled up by way of stop gap arrangement?
                          vii) Since 2008 how many times the post of Director of
                          Medical Education has been filled up by way of stop gap
                          arrangement and in what manner?
                          Let the supplementary affidavit be filed within 10 days from
                  today.”
14.               Thereafter, the supplementary affidavit was filed on
28.05.2015. In response to various queries put up by the Court, it is
stated that as per the 2008 Rules, the post of DME is required to be
filled up by way of direct recruitment through APSC from amongst
the candidates having the eligibility criteria as stipulated in the
2008 Rules. Since coming into force of the 2008 Rules, the following
incumbents were appointed as DME, Assam:- 1) Dr. Umesh Ch.
Sarma, 2) Dr. Devajit Hazarika, 3) Dr. Dhruba Jyoti Borah and 4)
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                          Page 14 of 31

Dr. B. P. Chakraborty. Only Dr. Umesh Chandra Sarma was
appointed through APSC. The others were appointed as in-charge
DME as per orders of the concerned Health Minister. On previous
occasions, no applications were received from intending candidates
for the post of DME. The last incumbent, i.e. Dr. Dhruba Jyoti
Borah on being elected as President of Assam Sahitya Sabha
expressed his desire to relinquish the post of DME. At this stage,
the following three candidates submitted applications to the
Government for the post of DME:-1) Dr. B. P. Chakravorty,
Principal-cum-Chief               Superintendant,  Fakhruddin     Ali     Ahmed
Medical College and Hospital, Barpeta, 2) Dr. Debajit Hazarika, now
Principal-cum-Chief Superintendant, Jorhat Medical College &
Hospital, Jorhat and 3) Dr. Basanta Kumar Baishya, Professor and
Head of the Department, Neurosurgery, Gauhati Medical College
and Hospital, Guwahati. It is further stated that though in the past
the post of DME was not advertised, henceforth it would be
advertised for which purpose APSC would be moved.
15.               In the meanwhile, respondent No. 4, Principal-cum-
Chief     Superintendant,             Assam  Medical   College  and    Hospital,
Dibrugarh          has     filed     his  counter affidavit.  Though     various
statements have been made regarding performance of the petitioner,
Court is of the view that reference to the same may not be necessary
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                  Page 15 of 31

for the purpose of adjudication of the present dispute. Respondent
No. 4 while refraining from making any comment on the issue of
filling up of the post of DME as per the 2008 Rules, however
contends that the impugned transfer of the petitioner is a routine
administrative transfer and no case for interference is made out.
Petitioner cannot claim as a matter of right to remain at the Gauhati
Medical College and Hospital beyond the tenure period of three
years. No right of the petitioner has been infringed by the impugned
transfer order. It is contended that just because the impugned
transfer has been made on the eve of superannuation of the
petitioner the same cannot be a ground of interference. He has also
made various statements about his performance as Principal-cum-
Chief Superintendant of Assam Medical College and Hospital,
Dibrugarh, where he has completed more than 3 years of service.
Therefore, his transfer to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital is
justified.
16.               Respondent No. 3 has also filed his affidavit. It is stated
that he had completed more than 3 years at Barpeta and therefore
his transfer is justified. Contending that transfer of a Government
servant is an incident of service, he submits that petitioner cannot
claim as a matter of right to continue as Principal of Gauhati
Medical College and Hospital till his superannuation. He has stated
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                              Page 16 of 31

that since he would be holding the charge of DME, Dr. Ratan Kumar
Kokoti (respondent No. 5) has been posted as the in-charge
Principal-Cum-Chief Superintendent, Assam Medical College and
Hospital. He, however, admits that recruitment to the post of DME
is governed by the provisions of the 2008 Rules. Post of DME is
required to be filled up through the APSC from amongst candidates
having the eligibility criteria as stipulated in the 2008 Rules. Last
direct recruitment to the post of DME was done through APSC way
back in the year 2003 and thereafter Government has not recruited
any DME through APSC. Persons posted as DME were only allowed
to hold additional charge of DME while they were substantively
posted as Principal of Medical Colleges. He has also pointed out
certain functional difficulties in the recruitment of DME as per the
2008 Rules considering the retirement age and pay structure of
DME vis a vis Professor/Addl. Professor. He has stated about his
personal difficulties for which he had submitted representations
before the Government seeking transfer to Guwahati, firstly on
11.08.2014           and      thereafter  on   30.12.2014.  In  the     latter
representation, he mentioned that the post of DME was going to fall
vacant      and       requested      his consideration pursuant  to     which
notification dated 01.04.2015 was issued allowing him to hold
current charge of DME. He has stated that he joined the office of
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                              Page 17 of 31

DME on 02.04.2015. In such circumstances, respondent No. 3
seeks dismissal of the writ petition.
17.               Petitioner       has filed reply affidavit reiterating      the
averments made in the writ petition.
18.               While WP(C) No. 1944/2015 was being contested by the
respondents, the other two writ petitions, namely, WP(C) Nos.
3515/2015 and 3826/2015 came to be filed. In both the writ
petitions, prayer has been made to quash the notification No.
HLV.76/2015/13 dated 01/04/2015 appointing respondent No. 3
as DME on in-charge basis. Further prayer made is to fill up the
post of DME in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
2008 Rules. While the petitioner in WP(C) No. 3515/2015 is the
Professor and Head of the Department of Physiology and Medical
Superintendant of Tezpur Medical College, the petitioner in WP(C)
No. 3826/2015 is serving as Professor and Head of Ophthalmology,
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Medical College and Hospital, Barpeta. While
both of them contend that they have the eligibility under the 2008
Rules for the post of DME and claims prejudice because of non-
filling up of the said post by adhering to the procedure laid down
under the 2008 Rules, respondents more particularly respondent
No. 3 would contend that the two petitioners are not eligible for
holding the post of DME as both of them have crossed the upper age
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                Page 18 of 31

limit of 55 years for applying for the said post as prescribed under
the 2008 Rules. Petitioner in WP(C) No. 3826/2015 has however
stated that he being a candidate belonging to the schedule caste
(SC) category he would be entitled to age relaxation as per
provisions of 2008 Rules and therefore even now if the post of DME
is advertised he would stand a fair chance of competing for the said
post.
19.               Mr. Borbora, learned Sr. Counsel for the petitioner in
WP(C) No. 1944/2015 contends that it has been the tradition in the
Medical Colleges of the State not to transfer out a serving Principal
on the verge of superannuation. He submits that when the
petitioner has only a couple of months left for superannuation,
there can be no justification for transferring him to Barpeta. He
submits that though he has challenged his transfer, the same is in-
extricably linked with all the notifications issued on the same date.
The prime focus of the authority appears to be to ensure that
respondent No. 3 is made the DME and for that purpose the
charade of transfer has been enacted. Referring to the physical
impossibility of being the Principal of Assam Medical College and
Hospital at Dibrugarh and simultaneously holding the Office of
DME at Guwahati, he submits that to give effect to such an absurd
proposition, Dr. Ratan Kumar Kokoti (respondent No. 5), a serving
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                          Page 19 of 31

doctor at Dibrugarh, was sought to be made the in-charge Principal
at Dibrugarh. Referring to the various order(s) passed by this Court
he submits that holding of Office of DME by respondent No. 3 is an
additional charge, the substantive charge being the office of
Principal at Dibrugarh. Without taking over charge at Dibrugarh,
respondent No. 3 had rushed to take over charge of DME which is
legally unsustainable. He submits that in view of what has
transpired in the course of the hearing particularly with reference to
the filling up of the post of DME by respondent No. 3, the challenge
made by him to his transfer order cannot be adjudicated de hors
examination of the related issue of filling up of the post of DME as
both the issues have got inter-twined.
20.               Mr. B. D. Konwar, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the
other two petitioners submits that the 2008 Rules have been framed
under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. The 2008 Rules
lay down the detailed procedure as to how the post of DME is
required to be filled up. When rules are in force covering a
particular subject, it is not open for the State to embark upon a
procedure which is not sanctioned by the Rules holding the field. He
submits that the manner in which the post of DME has been filled
up particularly by respondent No. 3 is in complete violation of the
provisions of the 2008 Rules and has no legal sanction. He submits
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                           Page 20 of 31

that when the law requires a thing to be done in a particular way, it
has to be done in the prescribed mode and any other manner would
be unauthorized in law. He also submits that when eligible
candidates are available, the post of DME is required to be
advertised and filled up in accordance with the provisions of the
2008 Rules. Without undertaking the exercise as prescribed under
the 2008 Rules, it is not open to the State to contend that the 2008
Rules suffers from infirmities in so far recruitment to the post of
DME is concerned and requires amendment. In any case nobody
has prevented the State from amending the 2008 Rules for all these
years. He therefore submits that necessary direction may be issued
to the respondents to fill up the post of DME in accordance with law
and to strike down the appointment of respondent No. 3 as DME
vide notification dated 01.04.2015.
21.               Mr. P. Roy, learned Addl. Advocate General and earlier
Mr. JMA Choudhury, learned Standing Counsel, Health Department
submit that in so far filling up of the post of DME is concerned, the
Health Department will now take appropriate steps in accordance
with the provisions of the 2008 Rules. Further submission is that in
so far amendment to the 2008 Rules is concerned, State may do the
required exercise if amendment is considered necessary. Further
submission is that appointment of respondent No. 3 as in-charge
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                          Page 21 of 31

DME is only a temporary measure because the post of DME being
very important cannot be left vacant. However, in so far transfer of
the petitioner is concerned, intention of the Government is bonafide
as it has been carried out as part of routine administrative exigency.
No prejudice has been caused to the petitioner by such transfer.
There is no rule or prohibition that a Government servant cannot be
transferred on the eve of his superannuation. No fundamental or
legal right of the petitioner has been violated and therefore the writ
petition is liable to be dismissed.
22.                Mr. K. Agarwal, learned Sr. Counsel for respondent No.
3 in all the three cases while agreeing to the general consensus
arrived at the Bar in the course of hearing that the post of DME is
required to be filled up as per provisions of the 2008 Rules,
however, submits that respondent No. 3 is not the only officer who
has been appointed as in-charge DME. Prior to appointment of
respondent No. 3 and after retirement of Dr. Umesh Ch. Sarma, the
post of DME used to be filled up on in-charge basis as a stop-gap
arrangement without making recruitment through the APSC.
Therefore, singling out respondent No. 3 and impugning only his
appointment appears to be motivated. Regarding transfer of the
petitioner, he supports the stand taken by learned Addl. Advocate
General and the departmental counsel by contending that there is
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                            Page 22 of 31

no substance in the challenge made. He, however, submits that
respondent No. 3 is now functioning as in-charge DME and
following the order of this Court dated 10.04.2015, his substantive
posting is being shown as Principal-cum-Chief Superintendant,
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Medical College and Hospital, Barpeta from
where he is drawing his salary. In support of his submissions, Mr.
Agarwal has placed reliance on the following decisions:-
        (1993) 4 SCC 357 (Union of India Vs S. L. Abbas),
        (2004) 11 SCC 482 (State of UP Vs Gobardhan Lal).
23.               Mr. Pathak, learned Sr. Counsel who had initially
appeared on behalf of respondent No. 4 submitted that respondent
No. 4 has completed his tenure at Dibrugarh and the Government
has rightly transferred him to Guwahati on 01.04.2015 but he is
unable to comply with the transfer order because of the interim
order passed by this Court. He submits that law is well settled that
transfer being an incident of service a Government servant cannot
disobey a transfer order. He submits that the Government servant is
first required to comply with the transfer order and only thereafter
he can make a representation as to his grievance regarding transfer.
On the issue of filling up of the post of DME, learned counsel
submitted that respondent No. 4 would refrain from making any
comment thereon since he is not a claimant for the post of DME.
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                      Page 23 of 31

However, he submits that Court may pass appropriate order
keeping in view the mandate of the 2008 Rules. In support of his
submissions, Mr. Pathak has placed reliance on the following
decisions of the Apex Court:-
        (2004) 7 SCC 405 (State of UP Vs C. R. Ram and Anr)
        (2004) 11 SCC 402 (State of UP Vs Gobardhan Lal)
        (2006) 9 SCC 583 (S. C. Saxena Vs Union of India).
                  Mr.    K.     N.   Choudhury, learned Sr. Counsel     also
appearing for respondent No. 4 made similar submission.
24.               Mr. P. Kataki, learned counsel has appeared for
respondent No. 5 in WP(C) No. 1944/2015 and has supported the
stand of the Government.
25.               Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties
have received the due and anxious consideration of the Court. Also
perused the materials on record.
26.               At the outset, since there is a broad consensus
regarding filling up of the post of DME, the same may be taken up
first. Detailed reference to the relevant provisions of the 2008 Rules
has already been made in the orders dated 02.04.2015 and
10.04.2015 as extracted in the preceding part of this order.
Summing up the various provisions of the 2008 Rules relevant to
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                           Page 24 of 31

filling up of the post of DME, it can be said that the post of DME is a
Class-1 (senior grade) post at the top of the hierarchy being a single
post cadre of the Assam Medical Education Service. Post of DME is
required to be filled up by direct recruitment through the APSC by
observing the procedure laid down in Rule 6 (1) of the 2008 Rules.
Eligibility criteria are mentioned in Rules 7 & 8 read with Schedule
III to the 2008 Rules.
27.                Therefore, from the above it is evident that the post of
DME is required to be filled up as per provisions laid down under
the 2008 Rules which is by way of direct recruitment through APSC.
In the order dated 10.04.2015 it has already been noticed how
respondent No. 3 was sought to be appointed by the departmental
Minister. In his note dated 26.03.2015, Minister of Health and
Family Welfare, Govt. of Assam ordered that the incumbent Dr.
Dhruba Jyoti Borah was relieved of his charge of DME and in his
place respondent No. 3 was appointed as DME. Thereafter, as per
suggestion of the departmental authority, respondent No. 3 was
allowed to be the in-charge DME and for that purpose a substantive
post was required to enable respondent No. 3 to draw salary. It was
therefore suggested that respondent No. 3 be transferred to
Dibrugarh as Principal of Assam Medical College and Hospital since
respondent No. 4 was proposed to be transferred to Guwahati. It is
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                             Page 25 of 31

in this back drop that respondent No. 3 came to be appointed as in-
charge DME.
28.                This is certainly not the procedure prescribed for
appointment of DME under the 2008 Rules. It is the cardinal rule of
interpretation that if a statute provides for a thing to be done in a
particular manner than it must be done in that manner alone and
in no other manner. Apex Court has held that it is the basic
principle of law long settled that if the manner of doing a particular
thing is prescribed under any statute, the act must be done in that
manner and not at all. This rule has been recognized as a salutary
principle of administrative law and is being consistently applied by
the Indian constitutional courts. The origin of this rule is traceable
to the English decision in Taylor Vs- Taylor which was followed in
Nazir Ahmed Vs King Emperor reported in AIR 1936 PC 253
where Lord Roche famously declared that where a power is given to
do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that
way or not at all. Here in this case, the 2008 Rules framed under
the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution covers the field relating
to recruitment to the post of DME. Procedure for such recruitment
is laid down therein. When the procedure is laid down any deviation
therefrom is not permissible. Admittedly, after the retirement of Dr.
Umesh Ch. Sarma, all appointments to the post of DME were made
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                          Page 26 of 31

as stop-gap arrangement without following the procedure laid down
in the 2008 Rules. It is not understood as to how the Department
could have taken the stand at the initial stage of the proceeding that
there may be difficulty in carrying out the recruitment as certain
provisions of the 2008 Rules may require amendment when the said
procedure was never followed. Of course, subsequently such stand
was given up by the departmental counsel on the basis of the
supplementary affidavit filed and it was submitted that the
Department will take steps to fill up the post of DME in terms of the
2008 Rules.
29.               While the stand taken is appreciated, there is one more
aspect of the matter which has already drawn the attention of the
Court as reflected in the order dated 10.04.2015. On a perusal of
the record, it was found that three faculty members had submitted
applications for the post of DME. All of them stated that they had
come to know from “reliable source” that the post of DME was
going to fall vacant shortly and therefore they had submitted their
applications. This Court noted in the order dated 10.04.2015 that
the record did not disclose issuance of any advertisement or that
any invitation was extended by the Department inviting such
applications. This Court therefore observed that confining the
selection      to     only     the   three applicants who had   submitted
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                             Page 27 of 31

applications without any advertisement or invitation by the
Department to the exclusion of all other eligible candidates would
not be justified. In any case, in this age of transparency, why should
an aspirant come to know about a vacancy in a public post through
“reliable source”, even if it is a case of stop-gap arrangement. And
what is this “reliable source”? In the case of State of Orissa Vs
Mamata Mohanty reported in (2011) 3 SCC 436, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court held that it is a settled legal proposition that no
person can be appointed even on a temporary or adhoc basis
without inviting applications from all eligible candidates. The
Hon’ble Supreme Court emphasised that the equality clause
enshrined in Articles 14 & 16 of the Constitution would require that
every such appointment be made by an open advertisement as to
enable all eligible persons to compete on merit. Relevant portion of
the decision rendered in Mamata Mohanty (supra) is as under:-
                  “36. Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition that no person can be
                  appointed even on a temporary or adhoc basis without inviting
                  applications from all eligible candidates. If any appointment is made by
                  merely inviting names from the employment exchange or putting a note on
                  the notice board, etc. that will not meet the requirement of Articles 14 and
                  16 of the Constitution. Such a course violates the mandates of Articles 14
                  and 16 of the Constitution of India as it deprives the candidates who are
                  eligible for the post, from being considered. A person employed in
                  violation of these provisions is not entitled to any relief including salary.
                  For a valid and legal appointment mandatory compliance with the said
                  constitutional requirement is to be fulfilled. The equality clause enshrined
                  in Article 16 requires that every such appointment be made by an open
                  advertisement as to enable all eligible persons to compete on merit.”
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                                              Page 28 of 31

30.               In the light of the above, appointment of respondent No.
3 as in-charge DME vide the order dated 01.04.2015 which is under
challenge in WP(C) Nos. 3515 & 3826 of 2015 becomes wholly
untenable and cannot be sustained. It is accordingly set aside and
quashed.        In    view      of   the stand taken by  the   Department,
respondents are directed to fill up the post of DME by following the
procedure laid down in the 2008 Rules. This shall be done within a
period of 3 (three) months’ from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of this order. Petitioners of WP(C) Nos. 3515 and 3826 of 2015 may
apply for the said post if they are otherwise eligible.
31.                Now, adverting to the challenge made in WP(C) No.
1944/2015, law is well settled regarding the limited scope of judicial
review in matters of transfer and posting of Government servants.
The decisions cited at the Bar by Mr. Pathak and by Mr. Agarwal lay
down the well recognized legal proposition regarding limitation of a
challenge to a transfer order. Since the law is well settled, it may not
be necessary for a re-statement of the legal principles.
32.               However, it has already been noticed by this Court that
the issue of transfer of the petitioner got inter-twined with the
posting of respondent No. 3 as DME. The record did not disclose any
public interest or administrative exigency to justify the impugned
exercise. Transfer and posting of Government servants is always
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                             Page 29 of 31

guided by public interest and administrative exigency which is
however not discernible in the present case. In the light of the
above, Court is of the considered opinion that the matter may
require reconsideration by the departmental authorities.
33.               At this stage, submissions of learned counsel for the
petitioner that petitioner is on the verge of superannuation and at
the fag end of his service career, it is neither in the public interest
nor in the administrative exigency to transfer him thereby
dislocating his service and family life may require consideration on
remand. In this connection, reference may be made to a decision of
this Court rendered in the case of Narayan Chowdhury Vs State
of Tripura, reported in 1999 (2) GLT 360, wherein this Court had
interfered with the transfer of a Government servant as it was
passed about one and half years before his retirement by taking the
view that no practical purpose would be served by asking the
Government servant to proceed to his transferred place just for a
period of 5/6 months.
34.               Therefore, Principal Secretary to the Govt. of Assam is
directed to reconsider the grievance of the petitioner relating to his
transfer from Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati to
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Medical College and Hospital, Barpeta by
taking all relevant factors into consideration consistently with the
WP(C) Nos. 1944, 3515 & 3826 of 2015                             Page 30 of 31

observations made above. Let the fresh exercise be carried out
within a period of 30 (thirty) days from the date of receipt of a
certified copy of this order.
35.                Till such decision is taken, status quo as on today as
regards        posting        of     the petitioner as   Principal-cum-Chief
Superintendant, Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati
shall be maintained.
36.                All the writ petitions are accordingly disposed of.
                                                                  JUDGE
