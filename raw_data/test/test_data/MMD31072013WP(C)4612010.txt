   P R E S E N T:
                  THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M.M.DAS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. Das, J.         Both the aforesaid two appeals have been preferred by
   the appellant against the common judgment dated 6.9.2010 passed
   by the State Education Tribunal (for short ‘the Tribunal) in G.I.A.
   Case No. 263 of 2007 filed by the appellant and G.I.A. Case No. 18

                               2
of 2008 filed by the respondent no. 4 relating to the dispute with
regard to the date of their appointment to the post of Assistant
Librarian in Astaranga College in the district of Puri and to their
entitlement to receive Grant-in-Aid.
2.          Initially the appellant filed OJC No. 8934 of 1998
seeking a direction of this Court to the respondent nos. 1 and 2 not
to withdraw the sanction order issued in his favour and for a
further direction to release the Grant-in-aid forthwith as per the
sanction order already accorded. When the matter was taken up for
hearing as by that time Section 24-B of the Orissa Education Act
already came into operation providing a forum i.e. State Education
Tribunal, to adjudicate this dispute relating to release of Grand-in-
aid and approval of the post, the writ petition was disposed of by
order dated 6.11.2007       permitting the petitioner-appellant to
withdraw the writ petition and file an appropriate case before the
Tribunal.
3.          The appellant filed G.I.A. Case No. 263 of 2007 and the
respondent no. 4 thereafter filed G.I.A. Case No. 18 of 2008 before
the Tribunal.     The Tribunal adjudicating the dispute by the
impugned order, turned down the claim of the appellant in G.I.A.
Case No. 263 of 2007 and allowed the claim of the respondent no. 4
in G.I.A. Case No. 18 of 2008 holding that the respondent no. 4 is
entitled to approval of his post of Assistant Librarian and also

                                3
entitled to Grant-in-aid with effect from 1.6.1994.    Being aggrieved,
the appellant has preferred the aforesaid two appeals.
4.           The case of the appellant is that he was engaged on
honourary basis as Assistant Librarian in the college on 1.7.1987.
Subsequently, he acquired the qualification of Graduate in Arts as
per the certificate dated 20.6.1991 given by the Secretary,
Governing Body of the College. He was appointed on regular basis
as Librarian in the college as per appointment letter dated 3.7.1989
and he joined and functioned as such with effect from 3.7.1989. He
was offered to undergo the course of Library Science in Nilakantha
College of Library and Information Science, Bhubaneswar and
accordingly, the Secretary of the college sent a letter to the Principle
of   the   said  college   of  Library   and   Information     Science,
Bhubaneswar. After completion of the course, he resumed his duty
on 1.5.1992. However, he passed the Bachelor Degree in Library
and    Information  Science   on   13.9.1994    and his     name    was
recommended by the college in the prescribed Form-A to the
Directorate for the purpose of approval and release of Grant-in-aid
on 25.2.1995.     In the said Form, though the appellant’s name
appeared above the respondent no. 4 but wrongly the date of
appointment order of respondent no. 4 was shown as 1.2.1989 and
correctly as against the name of appellant as 3.7.1989. However,
the name of respondent no. 4 was shown against +3 Wing of the

                                4
college. The appellant alleges that the respondent no. 4 has never
been appointed from 1.2.1989, but, in fact, he joined in the college
with effect from 5.7.1993 against +3 Wing. It is further alleged that
there    is  no  resolution  of   the  Governing   Body    giving   him
appointment with effect from 1.2.1989.             There is also no
attendance register nor any Acquaintance Roll showing him to have
been functioning from 1.2.1989 or receiving any salary from the
college. The appellant, therefore, has alleged that the appointment
letter furnished by the respondent no. 4 is a manufactured one,
which was never issued from the college.           There is also no
communication by any memo number and date as per Dak
Dispatch Register of the college. There is no joining report of the
respondent no. 4 dated 2.2.1989.      The Director after verification of
the college records found the appellant to have been appointed with
effect from 3.7.1989 and therefore, Grant-in-aid was released in his
favour with effect from 1.6.1995 as per 1994 Grant-in-aid Order in
accordance with the Directorate Letter dated 25.3.1998.         At this
juncture, the respondent no. 4 sent an application to the Deputy
Director (+2 Education) on 17.4.1998 allegedly by forging a
certificate endorsed therein with memo no. 1234 dated 17.4.1998 of
the Principal of the college to the effect that the case of the
respondent no. 4 is genuine as per his contention made in the said
application.    The respondent no. 4 disputed the appointment of the

                                5
appellant and claimed to have been appointed earlier against +2
Wing. It is alleged that he manufactured another letter no. 1235
dated 20.4.1998 of the Principal of the college. The Principal has
denied those letters.    According to the appellant, there is also no
record in the college showing to have issued such letters and the
memo number and date as per the Dak Dispatch Register, but the
said Register shows that the said letters have been issued in
different context relating to different matters. When such dispute
was raised by the respondent no. 4, the Director as per his Office
Memo No. 27181 dated 11.5.1998 required the Principal of the
college to clarify the position being present before him, as to
whether the earlier letter sent by the Secretary in his Memo No.
1160 dated 14.12.1996 recommending the case of the appellant for
approval to the post of Assistant Librarian is correct or subsequent
letter no. 1235 dated 20.4.1998 in favour of respondent no. 4 is
correct.    The Principal attended the office of the Director on
12.5.1998 and certified on the letter no. 1235 dated 20.4.1998
purporting to have been sent by the Principal of the college as, in
fact, not sent by the college and similarly, the endorsement made in
the application dated 17.4.1998 by the Principal is also not correct.
The respondent no. 4 was appointed and joined with effect from
5.7.1993 as against +3 Wing of the college which was opened in the
year 1993-1994.       The appellant stating all these facts filed his

                               6
counter in G.I.A. Case No. 18 of 2008 filed by the respondent no. 4
before the Tribunal seeking a direction to treat him as the approved
Assistant Librarian of the college in question and to release the
salary component as provided to the post of Graduate Librarian.
5.          It is contended by the appellant that even though
exhaustive pleadings were submitted before this Court in the writ
petition wherein counter affidavits and rejoinder affidavit were filed
by the respective parties but still then the respondent no. 4 filed
G.I.A. Case No. 18 of 2008 before the Tribunal stating that the
appellant had no training qualification of Library Science and he
was not appointed from 3.7.1989 and his appointment being in a +2
Wing was the second post which was not permissible under law.
The college was notified as an aided college within the meaning of
Section 3 (b) of the Orissa Education Act as per Notification No.
15451 dated 15.2.1997 and the respondent no. 4 pleaded that the
Governing Body has submitted the Form-A with mala fide intention
showing him to have been appointed in +3 Wing instead of +2 Wing.
The Director without properly going through the records in a
mechanically manner recommended the name of the appellant for
approval against the said post for which the respondent no. 4 made
a representation to the Deputy Director claiming to have been
appointed with effect from 2.2.1989.       Therefore, the Governing
Body recommended to cancel the approval of the appellant.         The

                                7
Deputy Director after enquiry recommended to cancel the approval
in favour of the appellant and in this view of the matter, the
respondent no. 4 claimed that a direction should be issued for
approval of his appointment and not the appointment of the
appellant.
6.           Mr.   Mohanty,   learned   counsel   for  the   appellant
submitted that the Tribunal without appreciating the facts and the
documents produced, in its proper perspective, has committed an
error in passing the impugned judgment allowing the claim of the
respondent no. 4 and disallowing that of the appellant.
7.           Mr.   Sarangi,  learned   counsel   appearing    for  the
respondent no. 4, on the contrary, supporting the impugned
judgment, submitted that the Tribunal has correctly found that the
yardstick of non-teaching staff in non-Government colleges as
prescribed by the Government of Orissa on 8.7.1997 provides
admissibility of only one post of non-Graduate Librarian up to the
roll strength of 500 and further found that there is no claim in this
case that in the year 1989, the roll strength of the college exceeded
to 500. Thus, one post of non-Graduate Librarian was admissible
to the college. The Tribunal has further found that admittedly, in
1989 the respondent no. 4 was a non-graduate as he acquired
graduation in the year 1990 but he acquired the certificate of
Library Information Science in the year 1984, whereas the appellant

                               8
acquired the qualification of Library and Information Science in
1992.    Thus, in the year, 1989, by the time of appointment of
respondent no. 4 on 2.2.1989, he was having requisite qualification
of Library and Information Science.     The college was notified to
receive Grant-in-aid on 15.2.1997. By that date, both the appellant
and respondent no. 4 have acquired the qualification of graduation
as well as Library Information Science, but the respondent no. 4
having been appointed on 1.2.1989 and joined on 2.2.1989 was
senior to the appellant as he was regularly appointed on 3.7.1989.
As per the yardstick, only one post of non-graduate Librarian was
permissible. Therefore, the appellant who joined subsequent to the
appointment of respondent no. 4 can not have any claim for the
post.    The Tribunal relied upon the enquiry report of the Deputy
Director, Higher Education with regard to appointment, seniority
and approval of appointment in the context of approval of the
appointment of staff for release of Grant-in-aid.      The Deputy
Director has stated in his counter before the Tribunal that after
verification of the records, he came to the conclusion that
appointment of respondent no. 4, who was the petitioner in G.I.A.
Case No. 18 of 2008, was legal and valid in respect of +2 Wing of
the college and such appointment deserves to be approved and
consequently for release of Grant-in-aid.   Thus, he recommended
the name of respondent no. 4 for the above purpose. The Tribunal

                               9
after taking into consideration all the relevant records and the
recommendation made by the Deputy Director of Higher Education
allowed the G.I.A. Case No. 18 of 2008 filed by the respondent no. 4
while dismissing the G.I.A. Case No. 263 of 2007 filed by the
present appellant.
8.           It appears from the enquiry report of the Deputy
Director (+2 Education), Orissa annexed as Annexure-7 to G.I.A.
Case No. 18 of 2008 that the Deputy Director made a thread bare
enquiry referring to the documents produced by the college      and
found the anomalies in the documents sent to the Directorate by
the college and as a matter of fact, the photo copy of the Governing
Body resolution submitted to the Directorate was being verified with
the original Governing Body resolution dated 24.10.1994 of Sitting
No. 12 produced by the Principal-in-charge and it was found that
the photo copy given to the Directorate     is a manipulated one in
which the portion bearing the name of respondent no. 4-Shri P.K.
Jena was deliberately erased by putting a paper on it while
preparing a photo copy, but in the original Governing Body
resolution, the name of Shri P.K. Jena as Librarian appears and his
date of appointment is shown to be 2.2.1989. It was also further
found that in the original Governing Body resolution, ‘+3’ has been
inserted against the name of Shri P.K. Jena after erasing the
original portion and against the appellant, it has been inserted as

                               10
‘+2’ and the attendance register beginning from 1987 till 1989
showed that neither the appellant nor the respondent no. 4 has
signed the same.     The Acquaintance Roll was also found to be
manipulated.
9.          In view of such facts, this Court is of the opinion that
the Tribunal has rightly relied upon the enquiry report of the
Deputy Director and taking into consideration the yardstick of
1977, has rightly concluded that the respondent no. 4 was
appointed on 1.2.1989 and joined on 2.2.1989 i.e. prior to the
appellant and there was no second post of Assistant Librarian.
Hence, appointment of respondent no. 4 is entitled to be approved
and he is entitled to receive Grant-in-aid. As I find no infirmity in
the impugned order, the same stands confirmed.       Both the FAOs
being devoid of merit stand dismissed.
