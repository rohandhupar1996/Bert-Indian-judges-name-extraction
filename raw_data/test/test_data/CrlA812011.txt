                                                                               2
                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV)
(P. K. Saikia, J)
        This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated
03.02.2011, passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Sonitpur, Tezpur,
in Sessions Case No. 151/2006 convicting the appellant, namely, Sri
Mohendra Das (herein after referred to as the accused person) of offence u/s
302/201 IPC and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life and also to
pay a fine of Rs. 5000/- (Rupees Five Thousand) i.d. R.I. for another 6 (six)
months for the offence aforesaid.
2.      Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment, the
accused person has preferred this appeal citing several infirmities in the
judgment under challenge.
3.      We have heard Mr. S. Das, learned counsel for the appellant and also
heard Mr. D. Das, learned Addl. P.P., for the State.
4.      The case, projected by prosecution in the FIR dated 04.08.2005 and
in subsequent trial, in short, is that on 03.08.2005 at about 7 pm, accused
Mohendra came to the house of one Binanda Singh (since deceased) and
took him to the paddy filed in order to bring water delivery pipe from the
field. But Binanda did not return home that night. Next day in the morning,
daughter of Binanda found underwear, vest and Gamosa of Binanda lying in
the paddy filed.
5.      The matter was then reported to other family members of the
deceased. In the mean time, father of the accused was also requested to
give information about his son who is the appellant herein. In response to
such query, father of the accused replied that the accused had gone mad for
which he was hospitalized. However, such reply could not satisfy the family
members of the victim.
6.      Not being able to know anything whereabouts of the victim, Sri Bidhu
Ch. Singh, the informant and also the brother of the victim, lodged an FIR
with O/C, Missamari Police Station. On receipt of such an FIR, O/C,
                                                                  Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                3
Missamari Police Station registered a case, vide Missamari P.S. Case No.
61/2005, u/s 302/201 IPC and O/C himself took up the investigation.
7.      On the same day, the body of the victim was found floating in the
nearby river called Belsiri. During the course of investigation, the IO
conducted inquest on the dead body, sent the same to hospital for post
mortem examination, examined the witnesses, arrested the accused person,
did other things needful and on conclusion of investigation, he submitted
charge sheet u/s 302/201 IPC against the accused person and forwarded
him to the court to stand his trial.
8.      The learned Magistrate before whom charge-sheet was so laid,
committed the case to the Court of Session since the offence u/s 302 IPC is
exclusively triable by Court of Session. The learned Sessions Judge,
Sonitpur, Tezpur on receipt of case, on commitment, transferred the same to
the file of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, FTC for disposal in accordance with
law.
9.    Learned Addl. Sessions Judge, FTC, on receipt of the case on transfer
and on hearing the learned counsel for the parties, was pleased to frame
charges u/s 302/201 IPC against the accused person and charges, so
framed, on being read over and explained to the accused person, he pleaded
not guilty and claimed to be tried.
10.     During trial, prosecution had examined as many as 12 (twelve)
witnesses including the informant, I/O of the case as well as the Doctor who
conducted autopsy on the dead body. The statement of the accused person
u/s 313 CrPC was also recorded. His plea was of total denial. However, on
being required, he declined to adduce any evidence of his own.
11.     On conclusion of trial and on hearing arguments, advanced by the
learned counsel for the parties, learned Trial Court was pleased to convict
the accused of offences u/s 302/201 IPC and sentenced him to punishment
as aforesaid. It is that judgment which has been assailed in the present
appeal.
                                                                   Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                4
12.    Mr. S. Das, learned counsel for the appellant submits that judgment
under challenge cannot be sustained since the prosecution case is basically
based on last scene theory and such theory, in the case under
consideration, remains far from being established. In that connection, it has
been stated that prosecution could not even establish that on the fateful
evening, the accused visited the house of the deceased, much less his taking
the deceased from his house with him as alleged.
13.    Even if one assumes for the sake of argument for a moment that on
the fateful evening, the accused went to the house of deceased and left his
house taking the deceased with him, yet, in the facts and circumstances of
the present case, it cannot be said that the accused alone and none else,
was the person responsible for extinguishing the life of the deceased on the
night aforesaid.
14.    This is because of the fact that though the accused and the deceased
reportedly left the house of the deceased on the evening of 03.08.2005, yet,
his dead body was recovered on 04.08.2005, and that that too, only towards
the evening, meaning thereby that the gap between the time when the
deceased was last seen in the company of the accused person and the time
of discovery of the body of the deceased was too big for application of last
scene theory.
15.    It has also been stated that some very vital information including the
witnesses seeing the deceased leaving his house in the company of the
accused person or some of the witnesses seeing the victim walking on the
bank of the river Belsiri along with the accused person had not been
disclosed to the IO during investigation. But those witnesses chose to
disclose such evidence for the first time before the Court during trial which
makes the testimonies of all those witnesses to suffer from vice which is
commonly called as contradiction which again makes such evidence
unreliable.
16.    Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that in a case,
based on circumstantial evidence, prosecution needs to establish the motive
of the accused person but in the present case, prosecution had miserably
                                                                   Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                5
failed to prove the motive of the accused in killing the deceased. For all
those reasons, learned counsel for the appellant urges this court to set aside
the judgment under challenge on acquitting the accused person of the
offences, he was charged with.
17.    On the other hand, Mr. D. Das, learned Addl. PP, submits that
testimonies of PW 1, Sri Bidhu Ch. Singh, PW 4, Smti. Sabitri Rani Singh,
PW 5, Smti. Rupali Sing and PW 6, Smti. Dipali Singh clearly show that on
the eventful evening, the accused came to the house of the deceased and
took the deceased with him to the field in order to carry some water delivery
pipes there-from to the house of accused person.
18.    There is also evidence on record in the form of testimonies of some of
the witnesses to show that the blood stained clothes of the victim were
found at the field aforesaid early in the morning of 04.08.2005 which, in
turn, firmly demonstrates that the victim must have died on the night of
03.08.2005 itself. The fact that he did not return home although he was
supposed to return sometime thereafter makes such a conclusion inevitable.
19.    According to learned Addl. PP, there is evidence in the form of
testimony of PW 3, Sri Maheswar Kurmi to show that on the eventful
evening, 03.08.2005 being the evening, he saw the accused walking with the
victim on the bank of river Belsiri. Such evidence coupled with the fact that
body of the victim was found floating in the river Belsiri again shows that
the accused, and none else, had killed the deceased on the night of
03.08.2005.
20.    The death of the deceased is homicidal as disclosed by Dr. Lakhaswar
Bhuyan (PW 11). When such evidence of Doctor is considered, in the light of
other evidence on record, there cannot be any escape from the conclusion
that the accused was the person responsible for killing the deceased on the
night aforementioned. The learned Addl. Public Prosecutor, therefore, urges
this court to dismiss the present appeal on affirming the judgment under
challenge.
21.    Before we proceed further, we find it necessary to have a look at the
evidence of Doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead body. He is Dr.
                                                                   Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                        6
Lakhaswar Bhuyan, who was examined as PW 11. According to PW 11, he
performed the post mortem examination on the dead body of Binanda Singh at Civil
Hospital, Tezpur, on 05-08-2005 and found the following: ---
                      “An adult stout male dead body with rigor mortis.
                      The injuries over both sides of neck present with haematoma
                      and congestion of muscle of neck present.
                      Fracture of cervical spine at the level of C4 C5 present.
                      Blistering of skin present over rib walls.
                      All other organs are healthy.
                      Injuries described above are anti mortem in nature.
                      Opinion:- In my opinion, the person died of asphyxia as a result
                      of throttling and fracture of cervical spine.” He proved the post
                      mortem examination as Exbt. 5.
22.    The evidence of doctor reveals that the death of the deceased was
clearly homicidal in nature and it resulted from throttling and fracture of
cervical spine of the deceased. Now, the question which needs to be
answered is who occasioned the homicidal death of the victim on or about
03.08.2005. In this connection, we find it necessary to have a look at the
evidence of PW 1, PW 4 and PW 5.
23.    PW 1, Sri Bidhu Ch Singh deposes that the deceased was his cousin
and they lived in different houses but in the same compound. One day
towards the evening in 2005, the accused person came to their house and
requested the victim to accompany him to the field so that they could bring
water delivery pipe from the paddy field to the house of the accused person.
Being so requested, the victim left his house with the accused person.
However, his brother did not return home that night. Since the victim and
the accused were friends, he and other family members did not suspect
anything.
24.    In the morning, he sent his nephew Durga Singh to the house of the
accused person. On an inquiry being made by Durga Singh regarding the
whereabouts of the victim, the father of the accused person told Durga that
the accused had gone mad and was admitted at Tezpur Civil Hospital for
treatment. Thereafter, he (PW 1) along with Birendra Singh and Durga Singh
                                                                           Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                 7
started searching for the victim and in that process, they discovered one
Gaomsa, vest and underwear of the deceased lying near the water delivery
pipe. Thereafter, he lodged an FIR with the O/C, Missamari PS which he
proved as Ext. 1.
25.    Police came to such place and seized the said clothes on the strength
of seizure list Ext. 2. Further, on the same day at about 5 pm in the evening,
village people and his nephew Durga Singh discovered the body of his
brother floating in the river Belsiri. However, on the next day, he found the
dead body of his brother at the police station. At that time, they found the
body of the deceased without any clothes. He also noticed marks of injuries
on the body of the deceased.
26.    According to him, the place where the dead body was found floating
in the river is situated at a distance of 200-300 meters from his house. In
his cross examination, he confirmed that wife of the deceased saw the
accused to come to their house and also saw the accused taking the
deceased with him. In his cross examination, he further admitted that he
did not collect the Gamosa from the place aforesaid. Suggestions that the
deceased was a drunker or was in the habit of playing the game of betting
were denied by him.
27.    Smti. Sabitri Rani Singh ( PW 4) , wife of the victim, deposes that one
day at about 7 pm, the accused came to her house and left their house
taking the victim with him. Her husband did not return home that night.
They did not go out in search of her husband since the victim went out of
his house in the company of the accused person who happened to be his
friend. However, when he did not return home till next day morning, they
started searching for him.
28.    Subsequently, her daughter Dipali (PW 6) and Rupali (PW5) informed
her that the mud stained vest and Gamosa of the deceased were found lying
in the paddy field. Thereafter, the matter was reported to the police. On
same day, in the evening, the body of her husband was found floating in the
Belsiri river in a naked condition.
                                                                    Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                 8
29.    In her cross- examination, she states that her husband used to go to
the place where water delivery pump is located and she used to go to such
place carrying food for her husband. In her cross-examination, she also
admitted that when the accused came to her house, she was preparing food
in the kitchen and therefore, she came to know from her daughter Dipali
(PW 6) that the accused came to their house and left their house taking her
husband with him.
30.    Smti. Dipali Singh (PW 6) also deposes that on 03.08.2005 at about 7
pm, the accused came to their house and took her father to the paddy field
for watering in the field but her father did not return home that night. In the
morning, they started searching for their father and found the mud stained
clothes of the victim lying in the field. They reported the matter to their
uncle (PW 1) who, in turn, reported the matter to the police. Subsequently,
the dead body of their father was recovered from the river Belsiri.
31.    Supporting the statement of PW 6, Smti. Rupali Singh (PW 5) deposes
that one day in the evening at about 7 pm, the accused came to their house
and took her father to the field nearby for watering at such place. Her father
did not return home that night. Next day, in the morning they started
searching for their father and on arriving at the place where water pump is
installed, they saw the clothes of her father lying there, stained with mud
etc.
32.    Same day in the afternoon, the body of their father was found floating
in the nearby river. In her cross examination, she states that generally her

house on the evening, aforesaid, she was preparing food in the kitchen. She
confirms that they started searching for their father when her father did not
return home till the morning of the day which followed the night in question.
33.    Sri Maheswar Kurmi (PW 3) deposes that on 03.08.2005 at about 5
pm, he saw Binanda and Mahendra walking by the side of river Belsiri.
Next day, at about 7 am, he came to know from the wife of Binanda (PW 4)

                                                                                9
villagers as well. On coming to know about victim’s going missing since
previous evening, he came to the house of the PW 4.
34.     On arriving at the house of the PW4, he learnt from the later that
previous evening, the accused came to their house and took her husband
from their house to the field to bring water delivery pipes to the house of
accused person. On being so informed, he told PW 4 about his seeing the

prepared a sketch map of the PO which he proved as Exbt. 6. Meanwhile the
body of the deceased was found floating in the Belsiri river at a place falling
under Thelamara PS. Therefore, police from Thelamara PS retrieved the dead
body, conducted an inquest thereon and thereafter, sent the same to
hospital for post mortem examination. Since the accused had absconded in
the meantime, he could not arrest him immediately.
48.     In the meantime, the accused obtained pre arrest bail from the Court.
On the conclusion of investigation, he submitted charge sheet u/s 302/201
IPC against the accused person. In his cross examination, he confirms that
PW 1 did not tell him during investigation that when the accused came to
the house of victim on 03.08.2005 in the evening, the later was in his house.
PW 1 did not tell him during investigation that the accused along with other
killed the victim.
49.     In his cross examination, he further denied the suggestion (i) that PW
1 told him (IO) that he sent Durga Singh to the house of the accused person
                                                                      Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                              12
to make an inquiry about the accused person and (ii) that when Durga
Singh met the father of the accused person, he was told by the father of the
accused that the accused had gone mad and was admitted in hospital. PW
12 also confirms that PW 3 did not state before him that on 03.08.2005, he
saw Binanda and the accused walking on the bank of river Belsiri.
50.    Above being the evidence on record, let us see how far such evidence
makes out the allegations, leveled against the accused person. It is worth
noting that PWs were subjected to detailed cross examination and such
cross examination shows some infirmities in the testimonies of those PWs.
But such infirmities in the testimonies of PWs are found to be quite minor in
nature which occurred only in peripheral matters.
51.    Coming back to the evidence on record, it is found that evidence of
Doctor clearly reveals that deceased died a homicidal death since he died
due to asphyxia as a result of throttling. Though an attempt was made to
show that such injury may be self inflicted one, yet, there is evidence on
record to show that such claim has no basis whatsoever.
52.    This is because of the fact that there is indisputable evidence on
record to show that the victim died due to asphyxia as a result of throttling.
Such revelations, coupled with the fact that blood and mud stained wearing
apparels of the victim were found in the field whereas his body with very
many injuries thereon was found floating in a naked condition in the nearby
Belsiri river on 04.08.2005 , make such a conclusion inevitable.
53.    On perusal of evidence of principle prosecution witnesses, we have
also found that on the eventful night, same being 03.08.2005, the accused
came to the house of victim and left his house taking the deceased with him.
The evidence of PWs further demonstrates that victim and the accused
person were to go to the field to carry the water pipes there from to the
house of the accused person but he did not return home that night as
expected.
54.    On perusal of evidence on record more and more, it is also found that
on the next day, in the morning, the wearing apparels of the deceased were
found near the place where the water delivery pipes were installed. What is
                                                                  Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                13
important to note is that his wearing apparels, stained with blood and mud,
were found at a place where the accused and the deceased were supposed to
go on the evening in question.
55.     Record also reveals that though worried family members made frantic
search to trace the victim, such effort yield no result till the evening when
the body of the luckless person was found floating in the Belsiri river in a
completely naked condition. What is important to note here is that on
reading the evidence of the PWs including that of Doctor in totality, one
would find that the victim must have died on the night of 03.08.2005 itself.
56.     Testimonies of the PW 1, PW 4, PW 5, PW 6 coupled with averments
made in FIR make it more than clear that the victim was last seen in the
company of the accused person on the evening of 03.08.2005 when both of
them left the house of the victim presumably to carry water pipes from the
field to the house of the accused person.
57.     It is equally worth noting that PW 3 too saw the victim and the
accused hanging around on the bank of river Belsiri on 03.08.2005 in the
evening. Though the I/O confirms that PW3 did not told him that he (PW3)
saw the victim and the deceased roaming on the bank of river Belsiri on
03.08.2005 in the evening, yet, only for not divulging such information to
the I/O, the above claim of the PW3 cannot be thrown away.
58.     This is more so, when there is evidence on record in the form of res
gestae to show that some other villagers too saw those two persons roaming
on the bank of the river Belsiri on the evening aforesaid. Therefore, on the
basis of evidence on record, it needs to be concluded that the accused was
last seen in the company of the accused on 03.08.2005 in the evening. More
important, the victim appeared to have died on the night of 03.08.2005
itself.
59.     We have also found that the help of family members of the accused
person was sought for tracing the victim but family members of the accused
person did nothing to help the family members of the victim in locating the
later as is evident from the testimony of PW 1. Quite contrary to it, the
father of the accused tried to dodge such request for help by saying that the
                                                                    Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                14
accused had gone mad and as such, he was admitted in hospital for
treatment, a claim which is found to be huge lie.
60.     What is worse, the accused absconded soon after the incident in
question. Such conduct on the part of the accused as well as his father, in
the facts and circumstances of the present case, does not go well with the
claim of the accused that he is no way connected with the crime in question.
The fact that he absconded soon after the incident doubly demonstrates that
everything was not hunky dory on the part of the accused person.
61.     However, as stated above, prosecution case comes under sharp
criticism on counts more than one. It is alleged that the gap between the
deceased going missing on the evening of 03.08.2005 and discovery of his
body in the Belsiri river on 04.08.2005 in the evening is too big a gap for
operation of last scene theory.
62.     It has also been contended that some very vital information was not
disclosed by the prime prosecution witnesses , they being PW1 , PW4 , PW5
and PW6 , to the IO during the course of investigation although they chose
to divulge such information before the court during trial only which makes
their evidence to suffer from vice called contradictions.
63.     It has also been alleged that prosecution case is though based on
circumstantial evidence, the circumstances proved by the prosecution
hardly implicate the accused with the crime in question, much less, such
circumstances proving the charge leveled against the accused person.
64.     We have considered the submissions in the light of evidence on record
and have found that such contentions are without any basis. Our foregoing
discussions have made it more than clear and same needs no further
reinstatement. Suffice it to say that such allegations hardly find any ground
to stand on. Accordingly, all those allegations are rejected.
65.     Our foregoing discussion now, reveals that prosecution has proved
the below mentioned facts beyond any shadow of doubt:--
        (i) on the evening of 03.08.2005, the accused came to the house of the
        deceased and left his house taking him purportedly for carrying water
                                                                    Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                  15
       deliver pipes from the place where water pump was installed to the
       house of accused person,
       (ii) the victim did not return home that night,
       (iii) nobody suspected any foul-play since both the accused and the
       deceased were good friends,
       (iv) next day in the morning, a search was made for the victim and
       father of the accused was requested to give the whereabouts of the
       accused person,
       (v) father of the accused had stated that the accused had gone mad
       and was therefore hospitalized,         a plea found to be downright
       falsehood,
       (vi) the victim’s wearing apparels stained with mud and blood were
       found in the place where water pump was installed where the accused
       and the deceased were supposed to come on the evening in question,
       (vii) Villagers including PW 3 saw the victim and the accused roaming
       in the bank of river Belsiri on the evening of 03.08.2005,
       (viii) The body of the victim was found floating in a completely naked
       condition in the river Belsiri on 04.08.2005 in the afternoon,
       (ix) the death of the victim was found to be homicidal in nature and
       (x) The accused had absconded soon after the incident in question.
66.    When all those tremendously incriminating circumstances are read
together, it would appear clear that those circumstances form a chain of
events without any break anywhere which leads to lone and sole conclusion
that accused, and none else, was responsible for killing the victim on the
night of 03.08.2005. In our opinion, any other conclusion would be wholly
incompatible with the aforesaid proved circumstances.
67.    All the incriminating circumstances were notified to the accused
person while he was examined u/s 313 CrPC. He could not offer any
plausible explanations to those incriminating circumstances. Such failure
on the part of the accused person, in our considered opinion, as held in the
case of Prithipal Singh Etc Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. Etc reported in
(2012) 1 SCC 10, gives the prosecution case more and more firm footing to
conclude that the accused, and none else, was the person who killed the
                                                                      Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                                           16
victim on the night aforementioned. The relevant part of the aforesaid
judgment is reproduced below:-
               44. Both the courts below have found that the accused/appellants have
               abducted Shri Jaswant Singh Khalra. In such a situation, only the accused
               person could explain as what happened to Shri Khalra, and if he had died, in
               what manner and under what circumstances he had died and why his corpus
               delicti could not be recovered. All the accused/appellants failed to explain
               any inculpating circumstance even in their respective statements under
               Section 313 Cr.P.C. Such a conduct also provides for an additional link in the
               chain of circumstances. The fact as what had happened to the victim after
               his abduction by the accused persons, has been within the special knowledge
               of the accused persons, therefore, they could have given some explanation.
               In such a fact-situation, the Courts below have rightly drawn the
               presumption that the appellants were responsible for his adduction, illegal
               detention and murder.
68.     We have found that the victim did not have any ill habits, including
playing of cards or taking of alcohol. There is nothing on record to show that
any person had any ill motive towards the victim requiring such person to
hatch up any conspiracy to extinguish his life. In other words, there is
absolutely no material on record to show that any person other than the
accused had any opportunity or occasion to come in contact with the
deceased during the period between his going missing on the evening of
03.08.2005 and the discovery of his blood stained clothes at the place
aforementioned on 04.08.2005 in the morning.
69.     Such revelation, in no uncertain terms, demonstrates that the last
seen theory finds its application to the case in hand with its full force which
firmly establishes that the accused was the author of the crime in question.
The fact that the accused had failed to explain as to how the victim met his
homicidal death when he was still in his company during the time under
consideration as well as the fact that he was found giving false reply to the
proved circumstances make such a conclusion inevitable.
70.     In view of what we have discussed here in before we have found that
the accused is the person responsible for killing the deceased on 03.08.2005
and he is the person who took steps for concealing the dead body after
killing and therefore, in our opinion prosecution has proved the charge u/s
302 IPC beyond all reasonable doubt.
                                                                               Crl. A. No. 81 of 2011

                                                                              17
71.    Situation being such, in our considered opinion, the learned Trial
Court has rightly convicted the accused person u/s 302 IPC and properly
sentenced him to punishment and as such, judgment in question does not
invite any interference from this court of appeal.
72.    Accordingly, the present appeal lacks merit and same is dismissed.
73.    Return the LCR forthwith.
