       PRESENT:
                     THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
                    Date of hearing & judgment: 18.01.2018
Dr. A.K.Rath, J     Plaintiff is the appellant against a confirming judgment.
       The suit was for mandatory injunction.
       02.          The case of the plaintiff is that he filed T.S. No.50/85 in the
       court of the learned Munsif, Baripada against his mother and brother,
       defendant nos.1 and 2 and the legal heirs of uncle Ramanath Barik for
       a declaration that the wall of the ground floor situated in between his
       house, defendant nos.1 and 2 on one side and the house of the legal
       heirs of Ramanath on the other is a common wall of the parties,
       permanent injunction retraining the defendants from interfering in his
       right to use the wall and raising construction over the same pleading,

                                        2
inter alia, that with his         consent, the legal heirs of Ramanath
constructed a double storied building on the common wall on the
ground floor and made a R.C.C. roof on their first floor. There was an
understanding between the parties that the wall of their first floor
would be used as a common wall. When the plaintiff wanted to make
construction of his first floor over his house, the family members of
Ramanath branch did not permit him to use the common wall. The suit
was dismissed. Thereafter, he filed T.A. No. 6/38 of 94/90 in the court
of the learned District Judge. The same was dismissed. The suit wall
was declared as the joint wall of parties. The court declared his right to
use the wall and to make constructions over the same. Thereafter the
plaintiff constructed two rooms. On 16.04.1999, defendant no.2
forcefully trespassed into the first floor room and dismantled the same.
With this factual scenario, he instituted the suit seeking the reliefs
mentioned supra.
03.           Defendant     no.2   entered   contest   and   filed a  written
statement denying the assertions made in the plaint. The case of the
defendant no.2 was that the suit for mandatory injunction is not
maintainable. The first floor of the suit house was in existence since
long. The plaintiff had not constructed the first floor. The same was
constructed by defendant no.1 about twenty five years back. The
plaintiff was not in possession of the suit house. The judgment and
decree in T.A. No. 6/38/94-90 had attained finality. The plaintiff and
his family members were in occupation of the same. He did not
trespass forcibly into the first floor. The plaintiff has absolutely no
right, title and interest over the same. He is in occupation of the
ground floor prior to the filing of the suit for partition in the year 1989.
In T.S. No. 115/89, Bhabani Shankar Barik, who was one of the
defendants, admitted in his written statement that he is residing in the
first floor. The first floor of the suit house is his exclusive property. The

                                       3
plaintiff admitted in his evidence in T.S. No. 115/89 that it was
mutually agreed that Abhay Shankar Barik would reside in the first
floor of the suit building. In view of such admission, the plaintiff cannot
take the stand that the first floor was not in existence by the time of
filing of T.S. No. 115/89. The plaintiff is in possession of some portions
of the ground floor and also corresponding space of the first floor.
04.           On the inter se pleadings of the parties, learned trial court
struck    seven    issues.   Both  the   parties  led   evidence,   oral and
documentary, to substantiate their cases. Learned trial court came to
hold that there is no evidence on record that the plaintiff has
constructed the first floor. The order passed in the appeal, vide Ext.,3
reveals that the wall in question is a common wall. The property is in
joint possession. Placing reliance on a decision in Nagendranath Bose
v. Girija Prasad Bose, 1973 (II) CWR 1525, learned trial court came to
hold that since the parties are in joint possession, no injunction can be
granted.     Held so, it dismissed the suit.      The unsuccessful plaintiff
challenged the judgment and decree of the learned trial court before
the    learned   District   Judge,   Baripada,   which    was   subsequently
transferred to the court of the learned Additional District Judge,
Baripada and renumbered as R.F.A. No. 55/13 of 2007-2006.                The
appeal was eventually dismissed.
05.           Mr. Prakash Ranjan Barik, learned advocate for the
appellant argues with vehemence that the plaintiff has constructed the
first floor. He is residing therein with his family. His brother-defendant
no.2 is residing in the ground floor. Since he has created disturbances
in the possession of the plaintiff, the plaintiff filed a suit for mandatory
injunction.
06.           The plaintiff claimed that he has constructed the first floor.
No document in support of his claim is filed. In the earlier suit for

                                         4
partition, i.e., T.S. No. 115/89 filed by the plaintiff, the defendants filed
a written statement vide Ext.A stating, inter alia, that he is in
occupation of the first floor. Learned trial court came to hold that his
first floor was constructed in the year 1989.          The courts below held
that the property is in joint possession. Since both the courts below
concurrently held that the first floor is in joint possession of the
parties, the suit for mandatory injunction is not maintainable.
07.               In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed, since the
same does not involve any substantial question of law.
                                                     ………………....……..

Orissa High Court, Cuttack.
