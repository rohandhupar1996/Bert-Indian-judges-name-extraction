                      THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE B.K.NAYAK
                                           AND
                   THE HON’LE DR. JUSTICE D.P.CHOUDHURY
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Date of judgment:13.10.2017
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. D.P.Choudhury, J.          The petitioner, in this writ petition, assails the
     order dated 19.05.2015 giving promotion to the opposite party no.3 to
     the post of Senior Stenographer and the action of the opposite parties in
     not giving promotion to her.
     2.           FACTS
                  The filtrated factual matrix leading to the case of the
     petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed as Junior Stenographer in
     pursuance of the appointment letter dated 19.12.2005 vide Annexure-1
     by the learned District Judge, Cuttack and she joined in the said post on
     02.01.2006. The opposite party no.3, who is similarly situated, was

                                    -2-
appointed as Junior Stenographer earlier to the petitioner by the learned
District Judge, Cuttack. After the judgeship of Cuttack got bifurcated by
giving birth to the judgeship of Jajpur in 2012, the petitioner found her
name at Serial No.2 of the gradation list in the judgeship of Jajpur. But
the name of the opposite party no.3 did not find place there. The
opposite party no.3 was promoted to the post of Senior Stenographer in
the judgeship of Cuttack in 2010 on ad hoc basis being posted in the
Fast Track Court. But, due to abolition of Fast Track Courts, she was
reverted to the post of Junior Stenographer and it has been alleged by
the petitioner that said reversion of opposite party no.3 is illegal.
3.          Be it stated that the opposite party no.1 purportedly issued
draft gradation list on 9.2.2015 vide Annexure-3 for the judgeship of
Jajpur wherein the name of the petitioner finds place at Serial No.3 in
the grade of Junior Stenographer and the name of the opposite party
no.3 was found at Serial No.2 with the remark “Foregone Promotion”.
When it is a “Foregone Promotion”, the petitioner expected her
promotion to the post of Senior Stenographer, but the learned District
Judge, Jajpur published the final gradation list on 06.04.2015 vide
Annexure-4 wherein the words, i.e, “Foregone Promotion” have been
removed.
4.          Be it stated that injustice has been caused by the opposite
parties in preparing the gradation list because when the opposite party
no.3 has been promoted to the post of Senior Stenographer, it is not
proper to show that she has been posted as Grade-III Stenographer

                                     -3-
again by the opposite party no.3 in the gradation list. However, on the
disposal of the representation made by the petitioner, the opposite
parties informed that said “Foregone Promotion” has been inadvertently
typed out and the same has been deleted subsequently, which is also
challenged by the petitioner. The petitioner came to know that in the
redeployment while the judgeship of Jajpur was separated from the
judgeship of Cuttack, the opposite party no.3 was transferred as Junior
Stenographer to the judgeship of Jajpur. But, the petitioner arrayed the
same as illegal because the opposite party no.3 after foregoing
promotion has informed the concerned authority for her transfer to the
judgeship of Jajpur and the same has been considered resulting her
transfer to the judgeship of Jajpur. So, she claimed that the case of the
opposite party no.3 is an inter-judgeship transfer where she has to
remain in the bottom of the cadre of Junior Stenographer.
5.           The petitioner inter alia alleged that the opposite party no.2,
while did not consider the case of the similarly situated stenographers,
namely, Alok Prava Dalei and Chandrasekhar Pradhan, but considered
the case of the opposite party no.3 for her redeployment and the same
took place after the cut off date for which there is reason to believe that
this is a case of inter-judgeship transfer and the opposite party no.3 has
to remain in the bottom of the gradation list below the petitioner.
6.           It is further averred by the petitioner that the opposite party
no.3 was again promoted in the judgeship of Jajpur to the post of Senior
Stenographer when she has foregone her promotion at the first instance

                                  -4-
and reverted to the post of Junior Stenographer. So, her case is also
otherwise illegal and improper. On the other hand, in order to deprive
the petitioner from getting promotion, the opposite parties have
committed illegality by preparing false and incorrect documents, which
are de hors the law. The petitioner had made representation but the
same has been rejected vide Annexure-8 illegally. So, she filed the
instant writ petition to quash the impugned orders passed under
Annexures-4, 6, 8 and 11 and to give her promotion to the post of
Senior Stenographer, Gade-II with all consequential service benefits
from the date opposite party no.3 was promoted.
7.          Per contra, opposite party no.1 has filed counter affidavit
refuting the allegations made in the writ petition. The opposite parties
claimed that as per the Service Book, the opposite party no.3 entered
into service as Junior Stenographer in the undivided judgeship of
Cuttack on 23.03.1998 whereas the petitioner entered into service in
the same judgeship on 02.01.2006, which implies that opposite party
no.3 is senior to the writ petitioner in the undivided judgeship of
Cuttack.
8.          Be it stated that on 28.06.2012, there was bifurcation of
Cuttack   judgeship   and  the  new    Jajpur  judgeship  was   formed.
Redeployment of the Group-„C‟ and Group-„D‟ staff were made by the
learned   District  Judge,  Cuttack    taking  into  consideration  the
representation made by the employees of undivided judgeship of
Cuttack and G.A. Department Office Memorandums Dated 13.12.1996

                                     -5-
and 22.12.1997. Vide letter dated 30.01.2013, this Court in the
administrative side directed learned District Judge, Cuttack and Jajpur to
hold a joint meeting and in obedience to such direction, meeting was
held on 15.05.2013 and as an outcome of such meeting, leaned District
Judge, Cuttack, vide letter dated 03.09.2013, redeployed the service of
opposite party no.3 in the judgeship of Jajpur and opposite party no.3
joined in the establishment of Civil Judge (Junior Division) in the
judgeship of Jajpur on 10.09.2013 FN. Since the opposite party no.3 is
senior to the writ petitioner, her name was placed above the petitioner
in the gradation list circulated vide letter dated 06.04.2015 (Annexure-
H/1) by the authority and accordingly, when the next vacancy arose in
the cadre of Senior Stenographer, the office of the learned District
Judge, Jajpur placed the name of opposite party no.3 before the
Departmental Promotional Committee for promotion to the said post. It
is also the case of the opposite party that in the remark column of draft
gradation list in respect of opposite party no.3, due to typographical
error, it was mentioned as “foregone promotion”, but in the final
gradation list, the same has been rectified being deleted.
9.           The   petitioner  filed  rejoinder  affidavit reiterating the
averments made in the writ petition stating that it is not a deployment
posting of opposite party no.3 but a inter-judgeship transfer for which
the opposite party no.3 should be placed below the petitioner and in the
event of promotion, the petitioner should be promoted to the post of
Senior Stenographer in the judgeship of Jajpur. In the rejoinder affidavit

                                     -6-
filed by the petitioner, it has been already stated that the opposite party
no.3 has submitted her representation on 22.06.2012 before the
opposite party no.2 for her posting in the judgeship of Jajpur even at
the cost of foregoing promotion, if no post of Senior Stenographer is
available   in  the   judgeship   of  Jajpur.   She   also   made    another
representation on 04.07.2012 reiterating the same to get herself posted
in the judgeship of Jajpur, she is ready and willing to forego her
promotional post. Be it stated that since the willingness of opposite
party no.3 was given to work in the judgeship of Jajpur after the cut off
date, i.e, 28.06.2012, the deployment of opposite party no.3 should be
treated as inter-judgeship transfer instead of deployment in the
judgeship of Jajpur. So, the preparation of final gradation list and giving
promotion to opposite party no.3 on such basis is not only illegal but
also de hors the principle settled by judicial pronouncement.
10.          In the rejoinder affidavit, the petitioner claims that the plea
of the opposite parties that the words, i.e, “foregone promotion”
mentioned in the remarks column of gradation list in respect of opposite
party no.3 was an error is deliberate suppression of truth and cannot be
a typographical error. It is specifically stated that the opposite party
no.3 was promoted on ad hoc basis to the post of Senior Stenographer
to work in the Fast Track Court, but subsequently reverted to the post
of Junior Stenographer with effect from 01.04.2013 is also against the
principle of law as the reversion to the post of Junior Stenographer was
without any reason. Again her promotion to the post of Senior

                                     -7-
Stenographer in the judgeship of Jajpur amounts to double promotion to
the   same     cadre   by an employee      which    is against   the  service
jurisprudence.
11.           SUBMISSIONS
              Mr.Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that the case of the petitioner should be considered in the light of the
position of law. Although, opposite party no.3 is senior to the petitioner
in their initial joining, but the name of the petitioner finds place at Serial
No.2 of the draft gradation list in the judgeship of Jajpur and the case of
the opposite party no.3 was considered later under inter-judgeship
transfer and accordingly, the name of the opposite party no.3 should
find place at the bottom of the gradation list for Junior Stenographer,
but the same has been done in this case illegally. When the opposite
party no.3 has got promoted to the rank of Senior Stenographer, the
posting of opposite party no.3 in the judgeship of Jajpur should be below
other stenographers of Grade-III.
12.           Mr.Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner further
submitted that the opposite party no.3, being promoted to the post of
Senior Stenographer and posted in the Fast Track Court, cannot be
reverted to the post of Junior Stenographer, Grade-II when no necessity
of reversion. According to him, after being reverted to the post of Junior
Stenographer, she cannot claim further promotion to the next higher
post as she has foregone the same. On the other hand, the name of

                                   -8-
opposite party no.3 should have been placed below the name of
petitioner while being deployed in the judgeship of Jajpur.
13.          Mr.Tripathy,  learned   Additional  Government    Advocate
submitted that the writ petition is not maintainable because the
petitioner has assailed the promotion of opposite party no.3 although
she is much junior to her having been recruited in the year 2006.
Moreover, the opposite party no.3 was promoted to the post of Senior
Stenographer on ad hoc basis being posted in the Fast Track Court,
which is also temporary cadre under FTC Scheme. When that Court was
abolished, the opposite party no.3 was reverted to the post of Junior
Stenographer, Grade-III in the year 2013 and there is no bar in law for
reversion of an ad hoc employee to the original post. So, the contention
of Mr.Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner that the reversion was
unholy and de hors the law is untenable.
14.          Mr.Tripathy,  learned   Additional  Government    Advocate
further submitted that by the cut off date, the opposite party no.3 has
made representation for her posting in the judgeship of Jajpur as Junior
Stenographer, Grade-III even if the post of Senior Stenographer, Grade-
II was not available in that judgeship and the same fact has only been
reiterated in further representation made on 04.07.2012. So, it cannot
be said that the representation was made after the cut off date, as
submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner. He further
contended that it is the prerogative of the employer to consider the
representation when the representations of opposite party no.3 were

                                    -9-
basically for deployment in the judgeship of Jajpur and this Court has
allowed both the District Judges to have a joint meeting and consider
the representations of the employees consequent upon which the
deployment of opposite party no.3 in the post of Junior Stenographer
was made in the judgeship of Jajpur, which is absolutely within the
provisions of law and the same cannot be termed as illegal or improper.
15.          Mr.Tripathy,   learned   Additional   Government    Advocate
further asserted that since the post of opposite party no.3 is based on
deployment in the judgeship of Jajpur on her parent cadre as Junior
Stenographer, Grade-III, the principles of inter-judgeship transfer per se
is not applicable in her case. Since the petitioner and the opposite party
no.3 were born in the same judgeship initially and the opposite party
no.3 is senior to the petitioner in the parent cadre, the final gradation
list showing the opposite party no.3 above the petitioner cannot be said
to be as illegal and improper. Therefore, the contention of learned
counsel for the petitioner bears no merit and the same should be
rejected.
16.          POINTS FOR DETERMINATION
             The main points for determination are; (1) Whether the
transfer of opposite party no.3 as Junior Stenographer, Grade-III to
Jajpur is an inter-judgeship transfer? and (2) Whether the petitioner is
entitled to promotion to the post of Senior Stenographer when the
opposite party no.3 got promoted to the said post in the judgeship of
Jajpur?

                                   - 10 -
17.          DISCUSSIONS
             POINT No.(1)
             It is the admitted fact that the opposite party no.3 was
appointed on 23.03.1998 whereas the petitioner was appointed on
02.01.2006 in the undivided judgeship of Cuttack. It is not in dispute
that both were working in the undivided judgeship of Cuttack till the
new judgeship of Jajpur was separated from Cuttack on 28.06.2012. It
is also not in dispute that with regard to redeployment of Class-III
employees in the judgeship of Cuttack and Jajpur, a joint meeting was
convened by both the District Judges on the direction of this Court and
the employees were redeployed.
18.          It is the case of the petitioner that the opposite party no.3
was regularly promoted to the post of Senior Stenographer, Grade-II as
per Annexure-10, but while reverted to the post of Junior Stenographer,
Grade-III as per Annexure-11, her promotion to the post of Senior
Stenographer, Grade-II was shown on ad hoc basis. It is also the
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that although the
Fast Track Court was abolished but the posting of opposite party no.3
along with similarly situated employees were withdrawn and posted in
other Courts, but not reverted like the opposite party no.3. Here, the
opposite   party    no.3  has   never   challenged   her  reversion  order
(Annexure-11) whereas the same is challenged by the writ petitioner.
When the reversion order is not challenged by the opposite party no.3
and by such reversion, the position of the petitioner in the parent cadres
is not affected, the petitioner has no locus standi to make prayer to get

                                    - 11 -
it set aside. Even if Annexure-10 is not properly worded, but the words,
i.e., “ad hoc” having been used in Annexure-10, the promotion of the
opposite party no.3 has been considered by the employer as ad hoc
basis because of temporary Fast Track Court Scheme. The employer can
take decision where and how the employee would be required to be
promoted and posted and it is the concerned employee(s) whose
interest is affected by such promotion or the reversion having immediate
effect may challenge.
19.          Relying   upon    the  counter   affidavit, it is  clarified by
Mr.Tripathy, learned Additional Government Advocate that in the remark
column of the draft gradation list, it is mentioned that the opposite party
no.3 has foregone promotion, but it was inadvertent one. At the same
time, that typographical error has been rectified subsequently in the
final gradation list but the petitioner challenged the same as intentional
or deliberate one and her claim is based on the representation of the
opposite party no.3 vide Annexures-13 and 14.
20.          On    going   through   Annexure-13,     it  appears   that  on
22.06.2012, opposite party no.3 made a request to deploy her in the
judgeship of Jajpur even in the post of Junior Stenographer, if she would
not be accommodated in the post of Senior Stenographer that she was
enjoying by then for any administrative reason. This letter cannot be
termed as foregoing promotion. Annexure-14 also shows that on
04.07.2012, she also made similar request. On going through both the
annexures, it appears that they cannot be read as letter of foregoing

                                   - 12 -
promotion. Under the service jurisprudence, an employee can forego
promotion when he/she is offered the same. Here, in this case there is
no offer of promotion to the opposite party no.3 for which question of
foregoing promotion does not arise. These annexures are nothing but
request to deploy her in the judgeship of Jajpur.
21.          When Annexure-11 dated 30.03.2013 shows that opposite
party no.3 has been reverted to the post of Junior Stenographer, Grade-
III, as it appears from the proceeding of the joint meeting vide
Annexures-C/1 her request for her deployment placed and both the
District Judges decided to place her service in the judgeship of Jajpur,
the case of the opposite party no.3 was considered on the basis of
deployment in the judgeship of Jajpur on 15.05.2013. Accordingly,
Annexures-D/1, E/1 and F/1 show that subsequently opposite party no.3
was posted in the judgeship of Jajpur and she resumed her duty as
Junior Stenographer, Grade-III in the Court of the learned Civil Judge,
Senior Division, Jajpur on 10.09.2013.
22.          Learned counsel for the petitioner claimed that the aforesaid
posting was nothing but inter-judgeship transfer. Now, question arises
what is inter-judgeship transfer? The inter-judgeship transfer for Group-
„C‟ staff at first was formulated on 16.10.1985. We take cognizance of
the letter of this Court dated 16.10.1985 where the District and Sessions
Judges were asked to forward the applications of the intending
candidates who fulfil the prescribed terms and conditions. Such terms
and conditions are as under:

                                   - 13 -
            “Terms & Conditions:
            1. He must have served not less than 5 years in the
            present post.
            2. He must have cleared all the Departmental
            Examination.
            3. He must undertake not to claim his seniority in the
            Judgeship where he intends to serve.
            4. In no case, applications of the employees other
            than Jr. Clerks, Jr. Typists and Jr. Stenographers will
            be considered.”
            The aforesaid letter of this Court dated 16.10.1985 has also
been reiterated by issuing another letter of this Court dated 31.03.2015.
Not only this but also the inter-judgeship transfer has been also
recognized by Rule-13 of Orissa District and Sub-ordinate Courts‟ Non-
Judicial Staff Services (Method of Recruitment and Conditions of
Service) Rules, 2008 (hereinafter called as “the Rules, 2008”), which
speaks as under:
            “13.Transfer of Clerks:-
            (1) Any person in the post of Junior Clerk/Senior
            Clerk, Senior Clerk (Head Clerk Grade), Typist,
            Copyist and Stenographer Grade-III or Stenographer
            Grade-II shall ordinarily be transferred to any other
            office or seat within the administrative control of the
            District Judge on completion of three years period in
            any particular office or seat and the District Judge
            shall be the competent authority to pass such orders
            of transfer.
            (2) The Chief Justice of the Court shall be competent
            to pass order of transfer of the Subordinate Court‟s
            Non-Judicial staff of a District Court to another
            District Court within the State of Orissa on the terms
            and conditions fixed by him.
            The Chief Justice of the Court may also on the
            request of any member of Class-III and Class-IV
            service of the High Court, permit him/her to be
            absorbed in the ministerial service of the District and
            Subordinate Courts within the administrative control

                                    - 14 -
             of the District Judge in the base level post and
             his/her seniority will be fixed at the bottom of the
             cadre, provided the concerned District has no
             objection and the employee concerned is willing to
             forgo his seniority and join as the junior most in the
             category in which he/she is to be absorbed. In such
             event, the service rendered by such employee in the
             establishment of the High Court shall be taken into
             account for the purpose of computing it as qualifying
             service for the purpose.”
             From the aforesaid rule and the notification of this Court, it
is clear that the inter-judgeship transfer can be made for Group-„C‟ staff,
who have completed five years of service in the present post, must have
completed departmental examination and must undertake not to claim
any seniority in the judgeship where he/she intends to serve and after
all, the Hon‟ble Chief Justice has got the prerogative for transfer of one
Group-„C‟ employee from one judgeship to another judgeship within the
State of Orissa. In the event of inter-judgeship transfer, the employee
transferred cannot claim seniority. Obviously, it is understood that
he/she would be junior most in the same cadre in the other judgeship to
which place he/she transferred. But the transfer on deployment is
different from inter-judgeship transfer because deployment only occurs
where new district is created and it is governed by G.A. Department
circular, as aforesaid. In that circular, there are no such terms and
conditions.
23.          Applying the above principle, in the instant case, it appears
that no order of Hon‟ble the Chief Justice is available about inter-
judgeship transfer of opposite party no.3 to the judgeship of Jajpur.
When there is no order of Hon‟ble the Chief Justice for transfer to the

                                   - 15 -
judgeship of Jajpur under Rule-13 of the Rule, 2008, the principles of
inter-judgeship transfer are not applicable in the case of opposite party
no.3.
24.         On the other hand, the deployment of the staff having been
made under the order of this Court in administrative side, as per the
decision taken by both the District Judges of regular employee including
the opposite party no.3, the posting of opposite party no.3 in the
judgeship of Jajpur is on deployment but not as inter-judgeship transfer.
The Point No.(1) is answered accordingly.
25.         POINT NO.(2)
            It is the case of the petitioner that the opposite party no.3
was promoted to the post of Senior Stenographer, Grade-II in the
judgeship of Jajpur after the gradation list was published on 06.04.2015
vide Annexure-4. On going through the same, it appears that the name
of opposite party no.3 finds place at Serial No.2 whereas the name of
the petitioner finds place at Serial No.3. It is also found from Annexure-
6 that the opposite party no.3 has been promoted on 19.05.2015 to the
post of Senior Stenographer in the judgeship of Jajpur. No doubt, the
same was challenged by the present petitioner but the authority has
rejected the same.
26.         It is needless to say that the opposite party no.3 is much
senior to the petitioner on her initial appointment in the undivided
judgeship of Cuttack. It appears from the material that the petitioner
was also posted in Jajpur judgeship before deployment order issued and

                                   - 16 -
by that order, her deployment remained in new judgeship of Jajpur. It is
reiterated that opposite party no.3, being deployed in the judgeship of
Jajpur as Junior Stenographer, Grade-III, remained above the petitioner
as per gradation list and her posting is not under the inter-judgeship
transfer rule. So, as per Rule-11 of the Rules, 2008, opposite party no.3
has been rightly promoted to the post of Senior Stenographer, Grade-II
on the principle of merit-cum-seniority. But the case of the petitioner
can be considered for promotion only in the next vacancy occurred in
the cadre of Senior Stenographer, Grade-II. The Point No.(2) is
answered accordingly.
27.          CONCLUSION
             In the writ petition, the petitioner has prayed for setting
aside the impugned orders under Annexures-4, 6, 8 and 11 with a
further prayer to direct the opposite party no.1 to give her promotion to
the post of Senior Stenographer, Grade-II as per Annexure-12 with all
consequential service benefits from the date when opposite party no.3
got promoted. It has been already held that the transfer of opposite
party no.3 to the judgeship of Jajpur is not on inter-judgeship transfer
but on deployment basis by the concerned judgeships. So, the question
of applying bottom principle does not arise. Apart from this, it has been
already held that the opposite party no.3, has been rightly promoted to
the post of Senior Stenographer, Grade-II in the judgeship of Jajpur.
Thus, the petitioner‟s claim for such post superseding opposite party
no.3 is unjustified. Hence, the reliefs claimed by the petitioner in the

                                         - 17 -
    present writ petition are devoid of merits and accordingly, we decline to
    grant the same.
                 In the result, the writ petition is dismissed.
