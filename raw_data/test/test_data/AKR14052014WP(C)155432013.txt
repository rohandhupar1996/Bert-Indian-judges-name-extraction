                                  THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
              Date of hearing:07.05.2014       Date of Judgment:14.05.2014
         ________________________________________________________________________
Dr. A.K.Rath,J.       By this application under Article 226 of the Constitution, the
         petitioner has prayed, inter alia, to quash the notification dated
         18.9.2012 issued by the Land Acquisition Officer & Competent Authority,
         National Highway No.5 Project, Khurda, Bhubaneswar, in respect of his

                                        2
land appertaining to Plot Nos.253, 254/1103, Khata No.166, of Mouza-
Bomikhal, Bhubaneswar, vide Annexure-1.
2.            Shorn of unnecessary details, the short fact of the case of
the petitioner is that he is the paramount owner of two plots
appertaining to Khata No.166, Plot Nos.253, 254/1103 of Mouza-
Bomikhal. He has constructed a commercial building over the said two
plots. Out of the total area of Ac.0.262 decimals, the proposed
acquisition is Ac.0.98 decimals of land. The description of the land given
in the notification vide Annexure-1 is vague and indefinite. The proposed
acquisition is likely to affect the single structure of the building.
3.            Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has been
filed by one Smt. Sravani Pattnaik, Special Land Acquisition Officer,
(NH)-cum-Competent Authority, opposite party no.2. The sum and
substance of the case of the opposite party no.2 is that the Govt. of India
in Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, New Delhi vide Notification
No.S.O.2196(E), dated 18.9.2012 have intended to acquire land for
building, (widening/six-laning, etc.), maintenance, management and
operation of National Highway No.-5, on the stretch of land from
Km.0.000 to Km.62.000 (Bhubaneswar-Kolkata Section) U/s.3(A) of the
National Highways Act, 1956. Accordingly, the substances of above
Gazette Notification have been published in two local newspapers,
namely, Samaj & Sambad on 19.11.2012 inviting objection U/s.3(C) of
the National Highways Act, 1956 within 21 days. The petitioner filed an

                                      3
objection dated 8.11.2012 before the competent authority. The same was
disallowed on 15.4.2013 in view of imperative purpose for acquisition for
public purpose. The project in question has been designed based on the
details study done by Detail Project Report (DPR) consultant, keeping in
view the various relevant factors including intensity of heavy vehicular
traffic and public interest at large. The ministry as well as the National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has high degree of expertise in the
field and they are using the best technical know-how for implementation
of the project. The notification was issued under Section 3-A of the
National Highways Act, 1956 in the larger interest of public. The
notification was duly published in the official gazette on the same date.
The substance of the notification was also published in two local
newspapers containing full descriptions of the land proposed to be
acquired for widening of the National Highway. The names of the villages,
the survey number including the nature, type and area of the land have
been mentioned in the scheduled appended to the notification.
4.           We have heard Mr. M. Mohanty, learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mr.A. Das, learned counsel for the opposite party no.2.
5.           In course of hearing, Mr. Mohanty submitted that the
description of the land in the notification is vague and indefinite. He
further submitted that by the proposed acquisition, there is every
likelihood that the building will be collapsed. Relying on the decision of
the apex Court in Competent Authority Vs. Bangalore Jute Factory

                                            4
and others, (2005) 13 SCC 477, he submitted that the notification is
liable to be quashed on the ground that only a part of the land was
sought to be acquired, but the notification did not specify any such part.
6.           Per contra, Mr. Das submitted that the proposed acquisition
is for public purpose. He further submitted that the detailed description
of the property including the area has been given. Furthermore, it is
indicated in the notice that the land plan of the area and detailed
description of the property are available in the office of the Competent
Authority for perusal of the general public. Taking a cue from Union of
India Vs. Dr. Kushala Shetty and others, 2011 AIR SCW 4460, he
submitted that it was clearly mentioned that the land plans and other
details of the land were available in the office of the Competent Authority
and none of the land owners including the petitioner made any grievance
that the notification issued under Section 3A(1) of the 1956 Act was
vague.
7.           An identical question came up before the apex Court in
Kushala Shetty (supra). In para 19 of the said judgment, it is held as
follows:-
                     “19. In this case, notification dated 10.8.2005, which
             was published in the official Gazette of the same date and of
             which substance was published in two local newspapers,
             contained full description of the land proposed to be
             acquired for widening three National Highways. The names
             of the villages in which the land proposed to be acquired
             was situated, the survey numbers including sub-survey
             numbers, the nature, type and area of the land were also
             given in the schedule appended to the notification. Not only
             this, it was clearly mentioned that land plans and other
             details of the land are available in the office of the

                                                   5
                     Competent Authority. This is the reason why none of the
                     land owners (including the respondents) made any grievance
                     that the notification issued under Section 3A(1) of the 1956
                     Act was vague or that due to lack of particulars/details,
                     they were prevented from effectively exercising their right to
                     file objections in terms of Section 3C(1). Of course, a
                     grievance of this score was made in the objections dated
                     16.10.2006 filed by some of the land owners of Padavu
                     Village, but that was clearly an afterthought and, in any
                     case, the same did not require consideration because of
                     non-adherence to the time schedule specified in Section
                     3C(1) of the 1956 Act.”
8.                   We     have     carefully    and   meticulously       scrutinized the
notification issued under Section 3A of the National Highways Act, 1956,
vide Annexure-1. In the notification, the detailed description of land has
been mentioned. Moreover, it is clearly mentioned in the notification that
the land plans and other details of the land are available in the office of
the Competent Authority.
9.                   In view of the analysis made in the preceding paragraphs, we
are of the opinion that the writ petition is sans of merit and deserves
dismissal.
                     Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. No costs.
                                                                 ……………………
                                                                 Dr. A.K.Rath, J.
CHIEF JUSTICE :                   I agree.
                                                                  ……………………
                                                                   Chief Justice
