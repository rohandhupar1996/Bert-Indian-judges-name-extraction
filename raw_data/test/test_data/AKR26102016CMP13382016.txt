     PRESENT:
                   THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
      Date of Hearing: 18.10.2016          :     Date of Judgment: 26.10.2016
Dr.A.K.Rath, J.    This petition challenges the judgment dated 17.8.2016
     passed by the learned 3rd Additional District Judge, Berhampur, Ganjam
     in F.A.O.No.8 of 2016. By the said judgment, the learned lower appellate
     court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order dated 11.3.2016
     passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Berhampur, Ganjam in
     I.A.No.16 of 2016, whereby and whereunder, application of the petitioner
     under Order 39, Rule 1 and 2 C.P.C. for temporary injunction was
     rejected.

                                        2
2.           The petitioner as plaintiff instituted C.S.No.31 of 2016 in the
court of the learned Civil Judge (Sr.Division), Berhampur, Ganjam
seeking the following reliefs:-
             “(a)  Restraining the Defendants to demolish the structures
                   and making any construction over the Suit Schedule-B
                   property either by themselves or through their agents,
                   representatives etc,
             (b)   Directing the Defendants to fill up the holes and
                   remove the temporary structures over the Suit
                   Schedule-B property,
             (c)   Restraining the Defendants to transfer, mortgage and
                   alienate the Suit Schedule-B property in favour of any
                   person or persons,
             (d)   Directing the Defendants to make payment of
                   Rs.4,00,000/- towards damage caused to the Suit
                   Schedule-A property, and
             (e)   Further and other relief/reliefs as the Hon’ble Court
                   thinks just and proper during circumstances of the
                   case, in the interest of justice.”
3.           The case of the petitioner is that one Hari Krushna Padhi
had vast landed property. He died leaving behind his widow Ketuka and
three daughters, namely, Kanaka, Anusaya-petitioner and Sarojini. After
death of Hari Krushna, there was a partition of the properties between
his widow and three daughters and the deed was registered. In the said
partition, the house and house site described in the schedule-A fell to the
share of the petitioner. The same was mutated in her name. Similarly,
the land fell to the share of Kanaka and Sarojini and Ketuka were also
mutated. The house allotted to the share of Ketuka and her three
daughters was a single storied building. The suit house described in the
schedule-B fell to the share of Ketuka. Ketuka died in February, 1997.
The schedule-B property devolved upon her daughters. In the second
week of January, 2016, opposite parties 1 and 2 came to the schedule-A

                                     3
and B suit site with men and machinery to demolish the schedule-B
property and cut the common concrete roof.
4.           During pendency of the suit, the petitioner filed an
application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 C.P.C. for temporary injunction
restraining the opposite parties from demolishing the existing structure
standing over the schedule-B land and damaging the schedule-A land till
disposal of the suit.
5.           Pursuant to issuance of notice, opposite party no.2 entered
appearance and filed a counter affidavit admitting therein that Hari
Krushna constructed the suit house. He also admitted the partition of
the house left by Hari Krushna between his widow and three daughters
by means of a registered partition deed no.3686 dated 17.12.1973. In the
said partition, the petitioner got the northern portion of the house. To
her south, Sarojini got her share and to the south of Sarojini, Kanaka got
her share. Ketuka got her share in the southern end of house and house
site left by Hari Krushna. It is further stated that he was looking after
Hari Krushna and then Ketuka. Out of her love and affection towards
him, Ketuka gifted some of her property to him through registered gift
deed no.3044 of 1974. Ketuka bequeathed some other property in his
favour by executing a registered Will bearing no.79 of 1974. After death
of Ketuka, he is in possession of the schedule-B suit property as its
owner. The petitioner has no right, title and interest over the same, nor
she is in possession of the schedule-B property. He, his mother Kanaka,
the children of Sarojini and one Brundaban Padhi decided to construct a
multi-storied apartment over their land. Towards the south of the
schedule-B suit property, the land of Brundaban situates. All of them
requested opposite party no.1 to construct an apartment over their land.
Thereafter he executed a development agreement no.622 of 2014 in

                                      4
respect of the schedule-B suit property in favour of opposite party no.1.
Similarly, his mother has also executed another development agreement
no.623 of 2014 in favour of opposite party no.1. The children of Sarojini
have executed a development agreement no.185 of 2014 in favour of
opposite party no.1. After obtaining necessary sanction from Berhampur
Development Authority, opposite party no.1 demolished the structure
standing over schedule-B suit property. He has taken care to prevent any
damage to schedule-A suit property. In the process, opposite party no.1
has already invested crores of rupees in their project. Thus the petitioner
has no prima facie case, the balance of convenience does not tilt in
favour of the petitioner and she will not sustain irreparable loss and
injury, in the event the application is dismissed.
6.           The defence of opposite party no.1 is almost identical to that
of opposite party no.2. It is stated that to execute his project, he has
already spent rupees two crores by giving security deposit to opposite
party no.2 and others, who have executed development agreement with
him and towards process fee to the Berhampur Development Authority
and Berhampur Municipal Corporation. As per the terms of the
development agreement, he is required to construct and deliver the
completed flats to his claimants within 36 months. If injunction is
granted, he will sustain irreparable loss.
7.           The learned trial court came to hold that the petitioner has a
prima facie case, but then the balance of convenience does not lie in
favour of the petitioner and moreover, she will not suffer irreparable
injury in the event injunction is refused. Relying on a decision of this
Court in the case of M/s.Graftek Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sri Lord Lingaraj
Mohaprabhu, 1998 (II) OLR 404, the learned trial court directed the
opposite parties 1 and 2 to file an undertaking in shape of an affidavit

                                       5
that in the event they succeed in the suit, they will demolish that part of
schedule-B property which may be allotted in the share of the petitioner
and they will not claim any equity or compensation from the petitioner.
Held so, the learned trial court dismissed the application on 11.3.2016.
The petitioner unsuccessfully challenged the said order before the
learned 3rd Additional District Judge, Berhampur, Ganjam in F.A.O.No.8
of 2016, which was eventually dismissed.
8.           Heard Mr.B.K.Nayak, learned Advocate for the petitioner and
Mr.P.K.Rath, learned Advocate for opposite party no.1.
9.           The scope of interference with the order passed by the
learned trial court under Article 227 of the Constitution is limited.
10.          Dealing with the scope of Article 227 of the Constitution, the
apex Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Sh. Jai Singh and
Others, 2010 AIR SCW 5968 held thus:-
                          “xxx                xxx                   xxx
                          Before we consider the factual and legal issues
                   involved herein, we may notice certain well recognized
                   principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction by the
                   High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of
                   India. Undoubtedly the High Court, under this Article,
                   has the jurisdiction to ensure that all subordinate
                   courts as well as statutory or quasi-judicial tribunals,
                   exercise the powers vested in them, within the bounds
                   of their authority. The High Court has the power and
                   the jurisdiction to ensure that they act in accordance
                   with well established principles of law. The High
                   Court is vested with the powers of superintendence
                   and/or judicial revision, even in matters where no
                   revision or appeal lies to the High Court. The
                   jurisdiction under this Article is, in some ways, wider
                   than the power and jurisdiction under Article 226 of
                   the Constitution of India. It is, however, well to
                   remember the well known adage that greater the
                   power, greater the care and caution in exercise

                                        6
                    thereof. The High Court is, therefore, expected to
                    exercise such wide powers with great care, caution
                    and circumspection. The exercise of jurisdiction must
                    be within the well recognized constraints. It cannot be
                    exercised like a ‘bull in a china shop’, to correct all
                    errors of judgment of a court, or tribunal, acting
                    within the limits of its jurisdiction. This correctional
                    jurisdiction can be exercised in cases where orders
                    have been passed in grave dereliction of duty or in
                    flagrant abuse of fundamental principles of law or
                    justice. The High Court cannot lightly or liberally act
                    as an appellate court and re-appreciate the evidence.
                    Generally, it cannot substitute its own conclusions for
                    the conclusions reached by the courts below or the
                    statutory/quasi-judicial tribunals. The power to re-
                    appreciate evidence would only be justified in rare
                    and exceptional situations where grave injustice
                    would be done unless the High Court interferes. The
                    exercise of such discretionary power would depend on
                    the peculiar facts of each case, with the sole objective
                    of ensuring that there is no miscarriage of justice.”
                                                             (emphasis laid)
11.         In Dalpat Kumar and another Vrs. Prahalad Singh and
others, AIR 1993 S.C.276, the apex Court in paragraphs 4 and 5 held as
follows:-
            “4.            xxx                  xxx                  xxx
            Injunction is a judicial process by which a party is required
            to do or to refrain from doing any particular act. It is in the
            nature of preventive relief to a litigant to prevent future
            possible injury. In other words, the court in exercise of the
            power of granting ad interim injunction is to preserve the
            subject matter of the suit in the status quo for the time
            being. It is settled law that the grant of injunction is a
            discretionary relief. The exercise thereof is subject to the
            court satisfying that (1) there is a serious disputed question
            to be tried in the suit and that an act, on the facts before
            the court, there is probability of his being entitled to the
            relief asked for by the plaintiff/defendant; (2) the court's
            interference is necessary to protect the party from the
            species of injury. In other words, irreparable injury or
            damage would ensue before the legal right would be
            established at trial; and (3) that the comparative hardship

                                         7
            or mischief or inconvenience which is likely to occur from
            withholding the injunction will be greater than that would
            be likely to arise from granting it.
            5.       Therefore, the burden is on the plaintiff by evidence
            aliunde by affidavit or otherwise that there is "a prima facie
            case" in his favour which needs adjudication at the trial.
            The existence of the prima facie right and infraction of the
            enjoyment of his property or the right is a condition for the
            grant of temporary injunction. Prima facie case is not to be
            confused with prima facie title which has to be established,
            on evidence at the trial. Only prima facie case is a
            substantial question raised, bona fide, which needs
            investigation and a decision on merits. Satisfaction that
            there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant
            injunction. The Court further has to satisfy that non-
            interference by the Court would result in "irreparable
            injury" to the party seeking relief and that there is no other
            remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction
            and he needs protection from the consequences of
            apprehended injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury,
            however, does not mean that there must be no physical
            possibility of repairing the injury, but means only that the
            injury must be a material one, namely one that cannot be
            adequately compensated by way of damages. The third
            condition also is that "the balance of convenience" must be
            in favour of granting injunction. The Court while granting
            or refusing to grant injunction should exercise sound
            judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial
            mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the
            parties, if the injunction is refused and compare it with that
            it is likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is
            granted. If on weighing competing possibilities or
            probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the Court
            considers that pending the suit, the subject-matter should
            be maintained in status quo, an injunction would be
            issued. Thus the Court has to exercise its sound judicial
            discretion in granting or refusing the relief of ad interim
            injunction pending the suit.”
12.         On the anvil of the decision cited supra, the case of the
petitioner may be examined. The admitted facts of the case are ; (a) Hari
Krushna Padhi was the owner of the house and the house site, (b) Hari
Krushna died leaving behind his widow Ketuka and three daughters, (c)
through a registered partition deed no.3686 of 1973, Ketuka and her

                                      8
three daughters amicably divided the house site and house left by Hari
Krushna and took their respective shares, (d) A-schedule house and
house site lying to the north fell in the share of the petitioner, (e) to the
south of the A-schedule, Sarojini got her share and to her south, Kanaka
got her share of property and in the southern end, Ketuka got her share
and Ketuka was the owner of the B-schedule suit property and she is
already dead.
13.          The petitioner asserts that after death of Ketuka, she,
Kanaka and the children of Sarojini inherited the schedule-B suit
property. She has 1/3rd interest over the same. The opposite parties
assert that during the life time, Ketuka gifted some of her property to
opposite party no.2 by executing a registered gift deed no.3044 of 1974.
She bequeathed some of her other property in favour of opposite party
no.2 by means of a registered Will No.79 of 1974. The petitioner disputes
the genuineness of the registered gift deed and the registered Willnama of
1974 said to have been executed by Ketuka in favour of opposite party
no.2. Thus, the petitioner has a prima facie case. The courts held that
the structure standing over schedule-B property has been demolished
and the opposite parties constructed a multistoried apartment by
investing an amount Rs.2,00,00,000/-. The same was done pursuant to
development agreement entered into between the opposite party no.1 and
opposite party no.2. In view of the same, the courts have rightly held
that balance of convenience does not tilt in favour of the petitioner and
she will not suffer irreparable loss and injury, in the event injunction is
refused.
14.          In Mandali Ranganna and others etc. v. T.Ramachandra and
others, AIR 2008 S.C. 2291, the apex Court held that while considering
an application for grant of injunction, the Court will not only take into

                                        9
consideration the basic elements in relation thereto, viz., existence of a
prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury, it must
also take into consideration the conduct of the parties. It was further
held that grant of injunction is an equitable relief. A person, who had
kept quite for a long time and allowed another to deal with the properties
exclusively, ordinarily would not be entitled to an order of injunction. The
Court will not interfere only because the property is a very valuable one.
It is not oblivious of the fact that grant or refusal of injunction has
serious consequence depending upon the nature thereof. The Courts
dealing with such matters must make all endeavours to protect the
interest of the parties. For the said purpose, application of mind on the
part of the Courts is imperative. Contentions raised by the parties must
be determined objectively. Since construction had been made over the
suit schedule property, the apex Court allowed the respondents to carry
out the construction of the building and held that the same shall be
subject to the ultimate decision of the suit.
15.             On taking a holistic view of the matter, this Court is of the
opinion that no case is made out for interference. Accordingly, the
petition is dismissed. No costs.
