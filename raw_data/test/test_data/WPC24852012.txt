                             JUDGMENT & ORDER
         Desperately seeking appointment to the post of Subject Teacher in
Zoology in the provincialized Higher Secondary Schools of the State of
Assam since 2008, which has remained as elusive as ever, the petitioner is
initiating another round of litigation by way of this writ petition.
2.       The petitioner is a master degree holder in Zoology and stood 1st in
the Second Class in the year 1991 conducted by the Gauhati University. She
had participated in the selection process for appointment to the post of
Subject Teacher in Zoology in the various provincialized Higher Secondary
Schools of the Assam in the year 1995. In the select list so prepared, her
name appeared in serial No. 47 against the advertised vacant posts of 20.
According to the petitioner, the select list was never acted upon nor was she
provided the correct information about the fate of the select list. She was
ultimately informed that the select list did not get the approval and the same
had become invalid due to lapse of time. However, she subsequently came to
learn that candidates below her in the select list as well as candidates who
were not included in the select list had been appointed against the
advertised posts of Subject Teacher in Zoology. When she approached the
authorities under the Right to Information Act, 2005, she was informed by
the Deputy Secretary vide his letter dated 14-8-2007 thus:
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                          Page 3 of 24

             a) Select List of 1995 sent by the State Selection Board, Assam
                 was not approved by the Government and hence, nobody from
                 the select list was appointed by the Director of Secondary
                 Education, Assam.
             b) For the other information sought as per the RTI Complaint
                 Petition dated 9-7-2007 could not be provided as the relevant
                 file No. B(3) S 515/95 was missing from the Department.
3.       As no specific information is disclosed by the said letter dated 14-8-
2007 regarding the fate of the select list and the appointments being made
in connection therewith, the petitioner was constrained to file WP(C) No.
3175 of 2008 before this Court. In the meantime, following the said RTI
application filed by the petitioner, the respondent authorities lodged the FIR
dated 6-9-2007 with Dispur Police Station. Due to the magnitude of the
scam, the learned Single Judge passed the order dated 18-9-2008 directing
the Registry to place the matter before the Division Bench for consideration
as to whether the case should entertained as a Public Interest Litigation.
The Division Bench of this Court by the order dated 1-12-2008 then called
upon the respondent No. 1 to institute an inquiry into the issue pertaining
to the illegalities and irregularities alleged to have been committed in the
selection process in question. On 16-3-2009, the letter dated 13-3-2009 of
the respondent No. 3 addressed to the respondent No. 1 was placed before
the Division Bench disclosing that while filling up 20 posts of Subject
Teachers in Zoology in the said recruitment process, six candidates who
were below the petitioner in the select list and another 8 candidates who
could not made it in the select list were given the appointments. According
to the petitioners, the six candidates who were below her in the select/merit
list are:-
             a) Smt. Gitimoni Katikakaty (Respondent 4);
             b) Shri Pradip Das (expired recently);
             c) Smt. Lini Baruah (Respondent 5);
             d) Smt. Nili Kalita (Respondent 6);
             e) Smt. Archana Sarma (Respondent 7) and
             f)  Shri Khagendra Ballav Choudhury.
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                          Page 4 of 24

4.       It may be noted that the said Khagendra Ballav Choudhury is not
made a party respondent contrary to the averment by the petitioner in the
writ petition. According to the petitioner, the respondent No. 4, 5, 6, and 7
were placed below the petitioner at Serial No. 48 downwards. It is also the
case of the petitioner that the candidates who were not at all in the merit list
are as follows:
             a) Trinangajyoti Handique (respondent 11);
             b) Smt. Anjali Patar;
             c) Smt. Anjali Chakravarty
             d) Md. Nurula Huda (respondent 13);
             e) Sri Ajit Goswamy;
             f)  Sri Amuliya Goswami (respondent 14);
             g) Smt. Gitanjali Talukdar (respondent 10);
             h) Smt. Madhumita Das Borah (respondent 8).
5.       At this stage, it may also be noticed that Anjali Patar, Anjali
Chakravarty and Ajit Goswami are not impleaded as party respondents
contrary to the pleaded case of the petitioner. This Court had initially not
thought it appropriate to interfere with their appointments since they had by
then been rendering services for more than a decade provided the
respondent authorities could accommodate the petitioner. But when the
learned standing counsel for the Education Department informed this Court
that the respondent authorities could not accommodate the petitioner, this
Court proceeded to decide the legality of their appointments. After perusing
the records of appointments, this Court unilaterally constituted a Special
Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate any wrongdoing in the said
appointments whereupon the case was ordered to be treated as PIL and was
accordingly registered as PIL No. 14 of 2010. In the meantime, the
respondent No. 3 vide his letter dated 20-2-2010 in reply to the letter of the
petitioner confirmed that there was only one select list of 1995 prepared by
the State Selection Board, Assam from 1992 till date by stating therein that
“[A]fter 1995, this State Selection Board, Assam has not conducted any
interview/prepared list of Subject Teachers till date”. The SIT submitted
their report to this Court on 7-6-2010 wherein it found one Kumud Gogoi
responsible      for  the  disappearance   of  the  records  relating  to   the
appointments and six former Directors of Secondary Education, Assam
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 5 of 24

responsible for the illegal appointments. The SIT also revealed that one M.
Rahman, the then Deputy Secretary to the Government of Assam, Education
(Secondary) department responsible for giving false information to the
petitioner under the RTI Act, 2005with respect to the approval of the select
list of 1995 and the appointments of candidates in connection therewith.
This Court by the order dated 6-8-2010 disposed of the PIL directing the
respondent authorities to take into account the report of the SIT and
thereafter take appropriate action to discontinue the services of those
appointees who got undeserved appointments. The Court further directed
that if any adverse action was to be taken against any appointee, they
should be given an opportunity of hearing before termination orders were
issued. In so far as the case of the petitioner was concerned, this Court hled
that as she was position only at serial No. 47 of the select list against the
advertised posts of 20, she could claim appointment as per her turn if
vacancies became available through termination of the services of illegal
appointees and if appointment was refused by those who were in higher
merit position that the petitioner only upon which she could be offered the
appointment by virtue of her selection. The Court also directed payment of
compensation to the tune of ₹25,000/- to the petitioner for her efforts to
cleanse public life, etc.
6.       It is also the case of the petitioner that the then Director of Secondary
Education,       Assam    issued   the    advertisement   dated   20-11-1998    for
regularization of the services of the temporary/ad hoc appointees fully
knowing well that there was already the valid select list of 1995 and such
regularization exercise was in contravention of the provisions of the Assam
Secondary Education (Provincialization) Service Rules, 1982. According to
the petitioner, the only select list in existence between 1991 and 2003 was
the select list of 1995, which was, though, never published, but
appointments continued to be made from and outside the said select list till
2003: the services of these temporary/ad hoc employees, who were initially
appointed purely on personal consideration, came to be regularized. The
respondent No. 6 whose position in the select list was at Sl. No. 57, was
given the appointment vide the order dated 9-11-1999 in compliance with
the order dated 20-11-1996 passed by this Court in C.R. No. 4405/1995.
The respondent No. 6 was aggrieved by the appointment of the respondent
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                             Page 6 of 24

No. 14, who had been appointed outside the said select list, but the
respondent authorities continued to retain the respondent No. 14 in service
even after the appointment of the respondent No. 6. It is the contention of
the petitioner that such appointment is a clear indication that the select list
of 1995 was still operative 2003. The respondent No. 14 had secured only 54
marks which was less than the cut-off marks and could not therefore, make
it to the select list as found by the SIT. He was temporarily appointed n 20-
10-1995 just after the select list was sent for approval and his service
regularized on 27-8-1999 even when the select list was still operating. The
respondent No. 4 was initially appointed for a temporary period on 20-4-
1992. She had also appeared for interview before the State Selection Board
in 1995 and her position in the merit list was at serial No. 48, which was
below the position of the petitioner, yet she was given regular appointment
by virtue of her selection in the year 1995. Similarly, the respondent No. 5
was placed at 56th rank in the merit list, but was given temporary
appointment on 31-10-1995 though she was below the petitioner. Her
service was regularised on 31-5-1997. The respondent No. 7 was initially
appointed on temporary basis on 11-5-1992 and by virtue of the said
selection in the year 1995, her service was regularized on 2-6-1997 though
her position in the select/merit list of 1995 was at Sl. No. 64. The
respondent No. 8 and 9 were appointed on 26-11-1993 and 19-12-1994
respectively, but they did not appear in the interview held in 1995. Yet, they
were given permanent appointment on the basis of the screening process
held in 1999 for regularization of teachers whose temporary appointments
were extended by the respondent authorities on ad hoc basis. Their services
were regularized on 19-11-1999 and 11-2-2000 respectively. Similarly, the
respondent No. 10, 11, 12 and 13 were temporarily appointed on 5-10-1993,
17-5-1994, 21-9-1994 and 12-4-1993 respectively. Their services were also
regularized      on  22-3-2000,   30-12001,    16-11-1999   and   16-11-1999
respectively after undergoing the screening process: they had never
appeared for interview before the State Selection Board in 1995. It is
contended by the petitioner that the regularization of the services of the
respondent No. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 against the 20 posts so
advertised in the year 1992 is in contravention of the Assam Secondary
Education (Provincialization) Rules, 1982 (“the Provincialization Rules” for
short) and that their temporary appointment orders had also clearly
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 7 of 24

indicated that they would hold those posts till the candidates from the select
list were appointed. On 16-11-2010, the petitioner had filed M.C. No.
3978/2010 before this Court complaining of violation of the direction passed
by the Court in PIL No. 14/2010. In the affidavit filed by the respondent No.
1 therein had stated that in compliance with the order of this Court dated 6-
8-2010 passed in PIL No. 14 of 2010, show cause notices dated 10-5-2010
had been issued upon all the 20 Zoology Subject Teachers and after
consideration of their replies, it was found that they were not appointed in
conformity with the Provincialization Rules, their services were terminated
by the respondent No. 2 vide the order dated 7-6-2011 and 25-7-2011. On
the basis of the said statement, the Division Bench of this Court by the
common order dated 25-1-2012 disposed of the Misc. Case together with
Review Petition No. 117 of 2011 by holding that no further order was
necessary for compliance with the order of this Court and that with regard
to the claim of the petitioner in the Review Petition, she could not show
preferential right to appointment against available vacancy in terms of the
order dated 6-8-2010 inasmuch as no person lower in merit to her had been
considered or no person higher in merit to her was available (unavailable?)
for the appointment. In the meantime, the respondent No. 5, 6, 7 and 8 filed
a joint writ petition being WP(C) No. 3345/2011 before this Court
challenging their termination orders dated 7-6-2011 and 25-7-2011 on the
ground that they had not been served a copy of the show cause: they were
merely asked by the respective jurisdictional Inspector of Schools over
telephone on 17-5-2011 to appear the Office of the respondent No. 2 on 17-
5-2011 and on their appearance, no proper hearing was given to them
except to ask them to write down the history of their appointments, which
they accordingly. This Court by the order dated 29-2-2012 quashed the
impugned terminations orders for violation of principles of natural justice
and directed the respondent authorities to reinstate them to service with
continuity in service by giving liberty to the respondent authorities to
proceed with the matter in accordance with law, if so advised. The
respondent No. 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 also filed separate writ petitions,
namely,      WP(C) No.  3093/2011,     WP(C)   No.   3089/2011,    WP(C)  No.
3191/2011, WP(C) No. 3260/2011 and WP(C) No. 3105/2011 before this
Court challenging their termination order dated 7-6-2011 on the ground
that their services were regularized on the basis of the recommendation
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                        Page 8 of 24

made by the Screening Committee and were not the beneficiaries of the
selection process conducted in 1995 and further that their cases were not
covered by the dispute raised in PIL No. 14 of 2010. This Court by the order
dated 29-2-2012 allowed the writ petitions and quashed the impugned
termination order dated 7-6-2011 in so far as the petitioners therein were
concerned and declared that they should be deemed to be in service all
throughout with all consequential benefits. It is contended by the petitioner
that during the investigation carried out by the SIT, it was unearthed that
there were actually 21 regular appointments made since 1995 out of which
one appointee, namely, Khagendra B. Choudhury had resigned and that
seven Subject Teachers were appointed till 15-12-1998 and the respondent
No. 4, 5 and 7 were among these seven appointees. It was further found out
by the SIT that the remaining 14 teachers were given regular appointments
after 15-12-1998, the date on which the file containing the particulars of the
select list of 1995 were missing while the respondent No. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13 and 14 were among the 14 candidates who were given regular
appointments in the absence of the concerned file. The SIT categorically
stated that out of the 20 appointed candidates, all the appointments except
that of     Shri Subhash Bhattacharjee and Madhumita Sen who stood at
Serial No. 11 and 13 respectively, were illegal. The SIT also held that the
appointment of candidates after holding the screening test conducted in the
year 1998 without first appointing the previous selected candidates of 1995
could not justified by any means. The SIT further held that the aforesaid 20
appointees for the posts of Subject Teachers in Zoology were appointed
against the same posts which were advertised for which the petitioner
appeared for the interview in 1995. In the meantime, the petitioner was
given to understand by the office of the respondent authorities that once th
termination orders of the private respondents had been set aside by this
Court, no further show cause would be initiated. According to the petitioner,
the vacancy caused by the death of the said Pradip Das is still lying vacant
for which she could be accommodated. As the litigations initiated by the
petitioner have not resulted in her appointment till now, the petitioner is
returning to this Court in this writ petition for redressal of her grievances.
7.       It is most unfortunate that the State-respondents have not even
bothered to file their counter-affidavit despite granting several opportunities
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                           Page 9 of 24

to them to do so by this Court: this is a case of 2012. The chance for filing
the counter-affidavit was granted to the State-respondents on 3-10-2013.
This was again reiterated by the order dated 2-9-2014 passed by this Court.
Under the circumstances, it can be presumed that they have nothing to say
against the allegations of illegalities and irregularities made against them.
However, the writ petition cannot be allowed on this ground alone: the
petitioner must succeed in her writ petition on the strength of her own case
and not on the weakness of the case of her opponent. Therefore, an attempt
shall have to be made to dispose of the writ petition on the basis of the case
pleaded by her after giving due consideration to the affidavits-in-opposition
filed by the respondent No. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13. As for the
respondent No. 8, no affidavit was filed by her, but her case is argued by Mr.
B.D. Das, who also represents the respondent No. 5, 6, 7 and 9 in the
course of hearing. As for the respondent No. 14, deemed service of notice
upon him has been declared vide the Registry note dated 7-8-2013.
8.       The case of the respondent No. 4 (Gitamoni Hatikakoti) as projected
by her in her affidavit is that she was appointed as subject teacher of
Zoology of Nazira Higher Secondary School in the year 1993 on ad hoc basis
against a non-Plan sanctioned post with the approval of the jurisdictional
Inspector of Schools. According to her, the Government of Assam took a
policy decision vide the Office Memorandum dated 22-2-1995 issued by the
Commissioner/Secretary, Govt. of Assam, Education Department directing
the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to regularize all ad hoc
appointees through the process of selection to be conducted by the State
Selection Board along with fresh candidates. She had appeared in the
interview conducted by the State Selection Board whereafter her service
came to be regularized on 21-5-1997 in the post to which she had been
rendering her service for the last 18 years: her appointment cannot,
therefore, be termed as an illegal appointment. Her regularization took place
before the disappearance of the said official file on 15-12-1998. It is true
that the termination order of her service was quashed by this Court when
she was never given adequate opportunity to present her case. According to
her, more than 880 subject teachers were appointed all over Assam on ad
hoc basis like her and their services were subsequently regularized either by
the Screening Committee or the State Selection Board during the period
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 10 of 24

1991-1995 in various subjects like Chemistry, Botany, Physics, English,
History, Economic, Assamese, Mathematics, etc. The Government of Assam
took a policy decision vide the Office Memorandum dated 22-2-1995
directing the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to regularize all ad
hoc appointees working against vacant posts to give finality to the vexed
problem of about 880 subject teachers throughout Assam and the selection
was primarily made to regularise these 880 teachers and then accommodate
fresh candidates through the process of selection by the Selection Board
along with fresh candidates. The answering respondent appeared before the
Selection Board, got her selected whereafter her service came to be
regularized against the post in which she has been working for the last 18
years. She denies that she was below the petitioner in the select list of 1995:
the petitioner is a fresh candidate, who had appeared in the selection
process arising out of the advertisement of 1995 whereas the answering
respondent was working against a sanctioned post since 1993, was called
for interview on 1-3-1995 and her service got regularized on 21-5-1997
pursuant to the policy decision taken by the Government vide the Office
memorandum dated 22-2-1995. This vital fact was overlooked by the SIT
and only 14 Subject Teachers on Zoology were victimized and their services
illegally terminated vide the order dated 7-6-2011/25-7-2011 leaving out
similarly situated 880 Subject Teachers of different disciplines like History,
Political    Science, Mathematics,   Physics,  Chemistry,     etc.,  but   their
termination orders were, however, quashed by this Court in WP(C) No.
3755/11. The SIT also did not consider at all the policy decision taken by
the Government which was taken as early as 22-2-1995: in fact, the
selection was process undertaken as a device to regularize the old Subject
Teachers whose services were utilized by the Government for the last 13 to
15 years and if the policy decision of the Government dated 22-2-1995 is
examined in the context of the old Subject Teachers vis-à-vis the fresh
candidates like the petitioner, the case of answering respondents is clearly
distinguishable and constitutes a class by itself and eligible to be treated as
a separate class. The petitioners have already completed more than twenty
years of service, and cannot be removed on such flimsy grounds: he official
respondents are also barred by the doctrine of estoppel from doing so. It is
submitted by the answering respondent that the petitioner had already
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                          Page 11 of 24

approached in WP(C) No. 3178/2008 and PIL No. 14/2010 on the same
causes of action, which were already decided by this Court.
9.       In affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No. 5 (Lini Barua),
she submits that the writ petition is not maintainable inasmuch as
         a) The issues raised in this writ petitioner have already been decided
             by this Court in its judgment dated 6-8-2010 of PIL No. 14 of 2010
             (earlier WP(C) No. 3178/08) and its judgment dated 29-2-2012
             passed in WP(C) No. 3345/08 and its common judgment dated 29-
             2-2012 passed in WP(C) No. 3089/11, WP(C) No. 3093/11 and
             WP(C) No. 3105/11. The petitioner has also filed a contempt
             petition in MC No. 3978/10, which had been disposed by the
             order dated 25-1-2012: this is, therefore, an abuse of process of
             Court.
         b) The validity of the select list in question expired long ago.
         c) The petitioner has no locus standi to challenge the appointment of
             the answering respondent inasmuch as the latter was not a
             candidate for the 20 vacancies advertised on 22-6-1992.
10.      According to the answering respondent, she joined the post of Subject
Teacher for Margherita Public H.S. School 3-11-1995 following her
temporary appointment on 31-10-1995 against the vacancy of one SP Das
whereafter her service was extended for three months from time to time. She
denies that her initial appointment as well his subsequent regularization
were due to extraneous considerations. In the meantime, the Selection
Board, Assam initiated the selection process wherein she, eligible fpr the
post, participated and got selected by the State Selection Board. Thereafter,
considering her ad hoc appointment and selection by the state Selection
Board, the respondent No. 2 by the order dated 31-5-1997 regularized the
service of the answering respondent. She denies that despite her selection
below the rank of the petitioner by the State Selection Board in the year
1995, she was given regular appointment. She also asserts that the vacancy
arose out of the retirement of the said SP Das was not one of the 20 posts
advertised in the year 1992, which fell vacant only on 1-4-1995 due to the
retirement of the incumbent i.e. the said SP Das: her service was regularized
considering her ad hoc service and selection by the State Selection Board.
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                          Page 12 of 24

She further denies that her appointment including others referred by the SIT
except two persons i.e. Subhash Bhattacharjee and Madhumia Sen are
illegal and that the appointment of candidates through the screening
process without appointing the previously selected and approved candidates
through a screening process from the list of 1995 cannot be justified as
stated by SIT report, which was prepared without hearing her and other
affected persons. She, therefore, contends that there is no merit in the writ
petition, which is liable to be dismissed at the very threshold on the ground
of non-maintainability.
11.      Coming now to the affidavit-in-opposition of the respondent No. 6, it
is stated by her that she was initially appointed as Vocational Subject
Teacher of Mandia Higher Secondary School, Barpeta by the order dated 15-
3-1995 issued pursuant to the order by the respondent No. 2 whereafter she
used to take classes of Zoology during the absence of the incumbent subject
teacher of the school. Subsequently, on 25-9-1995, the incumbent was
transferred from Mandia Higher Secondary School and she had been taking
Zoology class since the transfer of the said incumbent. On 6-10-1995, she
applied for appointment to the said vacancy. The Principal of the school had
issued a certificate dated 16-10-1995 regarding her service as Subject
Teacher, Zoology. However, when the respondent No. 2 appointed one
Amulya Goswamy as the subject teacher of the school instead of her, she
filed CR No. 4405/95 before this Court, which by the order dated 20-11-
1996 directed the respondent authorities to consider the case of the
petitioner for appointment as subject Teacher in Zoology in the next vacancy
which might arise subject to her fitness. Pursuant to the order of this Court,
the respondent No. 2 appointed the answering respondent as subject
teacher of Zoology in Machkhowa H.S. School, Dhemaji against the vacant
post of Indibar Buragphain who had resigned from that post. The answering
respondent thereafter joined the post against which post she was confirmed,
was then transferred to Kharupetia H.S. School, Darrang on her request
against the post lying vacant on the retirement of the incumbent. She joined
the post on 28-5-2004 and is still continuing in that post. In the meantime,
the State Selection Board conducted the selection process for the
appointment of subject teachers in various subjects: the answering
respondent appeared in the interview and got selected against the said
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 13 of 24

vacancy of Indibar Buragohain, who had resigned from service. It is claimed
by the answering respondent that the 20 posts of subject teacher in Zoology
so advertised in the year 1992 did not include the post held by her as this
vacancy occurred much after the said 20 posts were advertised. According to
the answering respondent, apart from the persons who got selected by the
State Selection Board, the respondent authorities had also initiated the
process for regularization of the services of ad-hoc employees through
selection by the Screening Committee by the order dated 16-10-1998. On
the basis of the selections made by this Committee, about 820 ad hoc
subject teachers in various subject teachers have been regularized in their
respective posts. It is pointed out by the answering respondent that this
Court in WP(C) No. 3345/11, while quashing her termination order dated 7-
6-11 and disposing of the writ petition on 29-2-2012 along with other cases
had observed that her case was altogether on a different footing, and there is
no adverse comment made by the SIT in its report against her appointment
and the appointments of other petitioners therein and directed that she
should be deemed to ob in service all throughout with all consequent
benefits. The indictment made by the SIT against her appointment was
without hearing her and other affected persons. These are the principal
contentions of the answering respondent.
12.      The respondent No. 7, in her counter-affidavit, has stated that she is
the founder teacher of Dinjoy Hazarimal H.S. School, Chabua, and was
appointed as Subject teacher of Zoology in the month of October, 1991 by
the Governing Body of the school. Subsequently, taking into account her
honorary service from 1991 and on the recommendation of the Managing
Committee of the school, the respondent No. 2 by the order dated 11-5-1992
temporarily appointed her as the subject teacher of the school for a period
fof three months against one of the posts sanctioned by the Government on
16-11-1991. She accordingly joined the post on 12-5-1992 whereafter her
services extended for a period of three or four months from time to time. In
the meantime, the State Selection Board initiated a selection process
wherein the answering respondent participated and got selected by the State
Selection Board for the post of subject teacher in Zoology. Considering the
long period of service rendered by her and her selection by the State
Selection Board, the respondent No. 2 issued the order dated 2-6-2007
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 14 of 24

regularizing her service. Her service was subsequently confirmed by the
order dated 4-3-2003: she is still continuing in that post. She also claims
that the post held by her was not included in the 20 posts of subject teacher
in Zoology advertised in the year 1992. Her contentions are also in pari
material with the contentions of the respondent No. 6 and need not be
referred to for the sake of brevity.
13.      The case of the respondent No. 9 projected by her in her counter-
affidavit is that by the order dated 19-12-1994, she was originally appointed
as subject teacher of Zoology on ad hoc basis in Nazira Higher Secondary
School, Savasagar for a period of three months and her ad hoc appointment
was thereafter extended from time to time. Ultimately, as in the previous
case, the respondent No. 2 issued the advertisement dated 28-10-1998
constituted a Screening committee for regularization of ad hoc teachers and
invited testimonials for verification. In response to this, the answering
respondent also submitted her testimonials and appeared for interview on 3-
11-1998 before the Screening Committee. The Joint Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Education (Secondary) Department by his letter
dated 13-1-2000 informed the respondent No. 2 that the services of the
answering respondent along with 48 other subject teachers have been
regularized. The name of the answering respondent appeared in Serial No.
37 of the list of teaches for regularization. Subsequently, the respondent No.
2 by his order dated 5-2-2000 adjusted the answering respondent against
the post which was allotted by various Government letters at Nazira Higher
Secondary Schools as subject teacher in Zoology w.e.f. 1-12-1996 whereafter
her service cam to be regularized by the order dated 11-2-2000. It is
asserted by the answering respondent that the services of about 820
teachers who had been initially appointed by the State-respondents in
different Higher Secondary Schools in different subjects on ad hoc basis
were regularized on the recommendation of the said Screening Committee.
Apart from this, the contentions of the answering respondent are one and
same with the stance taken by the other private respondents referred to
earlier and need not be referred to.
14.      In so far as the respondent No. 10 is concerned, it is her case that she
was initially appointed as subject teacher of Zoology in Grahampur H.S.
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                            Page 15 of 24

School, Kokrajhar on ad hoc basis for a period of three months vide the
order dated 5-10-1993. Her ad hoc appointment was extended from time to
time till her service, like the service of the respondent No. 9, was regularized
on 22-3-2000: she has since then been working as subject teacher of
Kamrup Academy H.S. School, Guwahati. It is also her case that the post
held by her was not one of the said 20 vacancies advertised on 22-6-1992.
The rest of her pleadings are one and the same with that of the respondent
No. 9. Similarly, the respondent No. 11 was temporarily appointed as
subject teacher of Zoology at Rajgarh Higher Secondary School on 17-5-
1994 by the order of the respondent No. 2 for a period of three months,
which was extended from time to time till his service came to be regularized
on 30-1-2001 on the recommendation of the said Screening Committee: she
was among those 820 ad hoc teachers whose services were regularized on
the recommendation of the Screening Committee. The rest of his pleadings
and contentions are one and the same with that of the respondent No. 10
and, as such, they need not be reproduced.
15.      Coming now to the affidavit of the respondent No. 12, it is her case
that she was initially appointed as subject teacher of Zoology in Lakhipur
Higher Secondary School on 21-9-1994 on ad hoc basis against the lien
vacancy of one Bharati Das, who, however, had resigned from her post in
the year 1996. Like other private respondents, her service was regularized
by the order dated 16-11-1999 issued by the respondent No. 2 w.e.f. 21-9-
1994 on the recommendation of the Screening Committee. She was among
those 820 ad hoc teachers whose services were regularized. According to
her, the post held by her was no included among the 20 vacant posts of
subject teachers advertised on 22-6-1992. Her contentions are also akin to
the contentions of the respondent No. 11 and the same need not be referred
to for the sake of brevity. It is also the case of the respondent No. 13 in her
affidavit-in-opposition that he was appointed as subject teacher of Zoology
on ad hoc basis at Jaleshwar H.S. School by the order dated 12-4-1993 of
the respondent No. 2 for a period of three months. Like the previous private
respondents, her service was regularized on 16-11-1999 by the order issued
by the respondent No. 2 on the recommendation of the Screening Committee
after his appearance in interview. His service was subsequently confirmed
on 5-5-2006. She, however, admits that the post against which he was
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                          Page 16 of 24

initially appointed on ad hoc basis was one of the 20 posts advertised on 22-
36-1992. In response to the said advertisement, she had applied for the post
but was not called for the interview. Her service was, however, regularized
along with over 800 subject teachers on the recommendation of the said
Screening Committee. According to the answering respondent, the SIT hailed
to appreciate that the post against which he was appointed and his service
subsequently regularized had fallen vacant only in the year 1996. He,
therefore, contends that the writ petition has no merit and is liable to be
dismissed with costs.
16.      Mrs. S.P. Hussain, the learned counsel for the petitioner, however,
maintains that the State-respondents have made a mockery of the judicial
process of this Court by half-heartedly issuing the show cause notices,
under the guise of complying with the direction of this Court, to the
respondent No. 4 to 16 to ensure their reinstatement by this Court on the
ground of violation of principles of natural justice and then hurriedly
reinstated them to service once the termination orders were quashed by this
Court: this nothing but a façade or a sideshow. According to the learned
counsel, the cynical action of the respondent authorities in arbitrarily
terminating the services of the private respondents to circumvent the
various orders of this Court must be exposed and appropriate corrective
measures made to uphold the majesty of law as otherwise wrong signals
would be sent to various departments that they could flout the directions of
this Court with impunity. On the other hand, Mr. B.D. Das, the learned
senior counsel for the private respondents, argues that the emotional
submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner is bereft of
substance and cannot substitute legally tenable submissions. He submits
that the petitioner did not even come within the top twenty of the select list
and cannot possibly have any legitimate grievance for not appointing her
when she managed to come within the 47th position of the select/merit list.
Whatever illegality or irregularity perceived by her in the selection process,
contends the learned senior counsel, had now been subjected to judicial
scrutiny and decided against her in the interlocutory order as well as the
common order, which has now attained finality and cannot be re-opened
except by an appellate court. He, therefore, strenuously urges this Court to
dismiss the writ petition. As already noticed, the writ petition initially filed
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                          Page 17 of 24

by the petitioner was by the order dated 8-9-2008 ordered to be entertained
as PIL. However, the Division Bench by the judgment and order dated 6-8-
2010 disposed of the PIL, now registered as PIL No. 14 of 2010, by directing
that departmental action be taken against the persons identified by the SIT
as responsible for causing illegal recruitments and by making the following
observations:
                 “(9) From the report of S. I. T., it is therefore crystal clear
         that several undeserving persons were given appointments on
         regular    basis.  The   relevant    records     pertaining  to    such
         appointments as well as the proceeding of the Screening
         Committee could not however be made available for Courts own
         scrutiny. It also appears that incorrect and false information was
         furnished to the petitioner, wrongly informing her that the select
         list, where the name of the petitioner figures at Sl. No. 47 was
         not approved. In fact to the prejudice of the petitioner before the
         State Information Commission was ordered to be closed on 07.
         092007 on the basis of the incorrect information furnished on
         14. 08. 2007 to the petitioner.
                 (10) In the case it has become quite apparent that
         undeserving candidates were appointed during 1995-2001 to the
         20 posts of Zoology Subject Teachers in different provincialized
         Higher     Secondary   Schools   in    Assam.     When    such   illegal
         appointments are found to have been made appropriate judicial
         order (s) for termination of such illegal appointment has to
         follow. In the present case however all such appointees are not
         before the Court i. e. Smti. Manimala Kakoti, Smti. Banti
         Talukdar, Smti. Gitanjali Deka (from Group-A); Smti. Bijuli
         Chakraborty (from Group-B) and Smti. Dipali Bora (from Group-
         C). All the relevant facts i. e. circumstances in which the 7
         regularization under Group-B and 3 regularization under Group-C
         were made are not before the Court. Whether such regularisation
         was against the advertised posts and if not what had happened to
         the advertised posts is also not known with certainty. In such
         circumstances it may not be appropriate for the Court to pass
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                            Page 18 of 24

         any order for cancellation of the appointments. But considering
         the information gathered by the S. I. T., we deem it appropriate
         to direct the State to take into account the report of the S. I. T.
         and thereafter take appropriate steps to discontinue the services
         of such appointees who got undeserved appointments. Of course
         if any adverse action is to be taken against any appointee, they
         ought to be given an opportunity before termination orders are
         issued.
                 (12) In so far as the relief claimed by the petitioner,
         considering that she is at merit position No. 47 in the select list,
         she can claim appointment only as per her turn. If vacancies
         become available through termination of illegal appointees and if
         appointment is refused by those who are in higher merit position
         than the petitioner, only then the petitioner can be offered
         appointment. Accordingly if the petitioners turn comes in order
         of merit she may then be appointed to the post of Subject
         Teacher     of Zoology  by  virtue  of    her  selection.   However,
         considering the fact that the petitioner had largely conducted
         the present proceeding on her own and her painstaking efforts
         and perseverance have had same impact on attempts at
         cleansing public life the Court directs that the petitioner should
         be suitably compensated for the efforts by payment of cost of Rs.
         25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousands) only which will be paid
         to her by the State Government in the Education Department
         within 30 days from today.”
                                                  (Underlined for emphasis )
17.      In purported compliance with the directions contained in the
foregoing paragraphs 10 of the judgment extracted above, half-hearted
exercises were taken by the respondent authorities to issue individual
notices upon the private respondents to show cause as to why their
appointments should not be cancelled and thereafter abruptly cancelled
their appointments. This prompted three of the said appointees, who are the
private respondents herein, to file a batch of five writ petitions being WP(C)
No. 3345/2011, WP(C) No. 3089/2011, WP(C) No. 3093/2011, WP(C) No.
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 19 of 24

3105/2011, WP(C) No. 3191/2011, WP(C) No. 3260/2011 challenging the
cancellation order. This Court by the order dated 29-2-2012 in WP(C) No.
3345/2011 and by the common order dated 29-2-2012 in the remaining
writ petitions quashed the cancellation order and declared that they should
be deemed to be in service throughout with consequential benefits. The
petitioner thereafter filed MC No. 3978/2010 before the Division Bench of
this Court praying for further order to be passed for enforcement of the said
order dated 6-8-2010 passed in PIL No. 14/2010. The Division Bench of this
Court in its order dated 11-8-2011 in the Misc. Case had held thus:
                 “On perusal of both affidavits, it appears that both the first
         direction given by the Division Bench has been complied with
         inasmuch as the services of 20 Zoology Subject Teachers were
         terminated. It is another matter that some of the persons
         terminated have approached this Court and have obtained an
         interim order. In so far as the respondents are concerned,
         necessary action has been taken pursuant to the order of this
         Court.
                 As regards departmental action to be taken against officers
         responsible for the records that are missing, the affidavit
         discloses essentially that three persons are responsible. They are
         Mr. Karuna Gogoi, Shri M. Rahman and Shri GN Talukdar.
                 It is not clear whether any action has been taken against
         Shri Karuna Gogoi. Learned counsel for the respondents should
         inform us on the next date fixed the action taken against Shri
         Karuna Gogoi.
                 In so far as Mr. M. Rahman is concerned, it is not stated
         whether any action has been taken against him.
                 The respondents will file an affidavit whether any action
         has been taken against Mr. M. Rahman, even though he has
         retired.
                 In so far as Mr. G.N. Talukdar is concerned, the affidavit
         states that he retired from service long ago and the servie rules
         do not permit any action to be taken against him.
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 20 of 24

                 Under these circumstances, it appears that the direction
         has not yet been fully complied, subject to what the respondents
         may say in the affidavit that should be filed by them.
                 With regard to appointment of the petitioner as Zoology
         Subject Teacher, it is stated by learned counsel for the
         respondents that the entire selection process was completely
         vitiated and it has been quashed, as mentioned in paragraph 3 of
         the affidavit dated 9th August, 2011.
                 Since    the   entire  process   has    been  quashed,    the
         appointment of the petitioner obviously cannot be made.
                 With regard to the fourth direction, that is, payment of
         cost, the petitioner says that the cost has been paid to her.
                 The only issue that, therefore, survives in this case is
         whether departmental action has been taken against Shri Karuna
         Gogoi and Shri M. Rahman.
                 The respondents would file an affidavit in this regard
         within 10 days from today.
                 List this case on 12th September, 2011.”

18.      Aggrieved by this order, which is interlocutory in nature, the
petitioner had approached this Court again in Review Petition No. 117 of
2011. The Division Bench of this Court by the common order dated 25-1-
2012 had disposed of both Review Petition No. 117/11 and Misc. Case No.
3978 of 2010 in the following manner:
                 “We have heard Mrs. S. Pervin, learned counsel appearing
         on behalf of the petitioner-in-person, Smt. Julekha Wahida
         Ahmed on the issue of further order required to be passed for
         enforcement of the order dated 6-8-2010.
                 In the order of this case dated 11-8-2011, it was noticed
         that the order dated 6-8-2010 stood complied with except for
         action against Sri Karuna Gogoi and Sri M Rahman for which the
         State was to file an affidavit. It is now stated by Sri A. Deka,
         learned    Standing Counsel,     Education    Department,   that   an
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 21 of 24

         affidavit in this regard has already been filed stating that action
         has been taken in terms of the order of this Court.
                 In view of the above, no further order is necessary for
         compliance of the order of this Court dated 6-8-2010.
                 As regards the claim of Mrs. Julekha Wahida Ahmed in
         Review Petition No. 117 of 2011, for appointment in terms of
         order of this Court dated 6-8-2010, it was noticed in our order
         dated 19-12-2011 that the petitioner had to show preferential
         right to appointment against available vacancy in terms of order
         dated 6-8-2010. It has not been shown that any person lower in
         merit to the said petitioner has been considered or that no
         person higher in merit to the petitioner is available for
         appointment. This being the position, in these proceedings, no
         further order is required to be passed.
                 Misc. Case No. 3978 of 2010 and Review Petition No. 117
         of 2011 stand disposed of accordingly.”
19.      At this stage, I may also reproduce below the reliefs claimed by the
petitioner in this writ petition:
              i. to direct the respondent authorities to initiate fresh show
                 cause notice on the aspect of induction of the respondent No. 4
                 to respondent No. 14 in service with respect to their position in
                 the Select List.
             ii. To appoint the petitioner in the vacancy caused due to the
                 demise of Pradip Das, or pass such further order/orders as
                 your Lordships may deem fit and proper.
20.      In so far as the first relief prayed for, namely, to issue fresh show
cause for inducting respondent No. 4 to respondent 16 in service is
concerned, as already noticed, the Division Bench of this Court in the
common order dated 11-8-2011 had already decided that the first direction
was complied with inasmuch as the services of 20 Zoology Subject Teachers
including the private respondents herein were terminated; that it was
another matter that some of the persons terminated had approached the
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                             Page 22 of 24

Court and had obtained an interim order and that in so far as the
respondents were concerned, necessary action had been taken pursuant to
the order of the Court. Thus, in the light of the aforesaid decision of the
Division Bench, it is obvious that this Court had already declined to
interfere with the reinstatement of the respondent No. 4 to respondent No.
16 in service after they obtained an interim order thereagainst. According to
the Division Bench, necessary action had already been taken pursuant to
the said order of this Court. In the common order dated 25-1-2012 passed
by the Division Bench disposing of both Review Petition No. 117 of 2011 and
Misc. Case No. 3978 of 2010 filed by the petitioner, it was reiterated that no
further order was necessary for compliance with the order of this Court
dated 6-8-2010. As for the second relief claimed in this writ petition, the
Division Bench in the said common order referring to its earlier order dated
19-12-2011 held that the petitioner had to show preferential right to
appointment against the available vacancy in terms of the order dated 6-8-
2010 and that it had not been shown that any person lower in merit to the
petitioner was considered or that any person higher in merit to her was
available for appointment and no further order was, therefore, required to be
passed in that proceeding. The net effects of both the decisions of the
Division Bench in the common order dated 25-1-2012, in my considered
view, are that the prayer of the petitioner for enforcement of the order dated
6-8-2010, namely, which included issuing fresh show cause notices to the
respondent No. 4 to respondent No. 16 as to why their services should not
be terminated after their reinstatement to their services following half-
hearted show cause notices issued to them earlier and further that the relief
claimed by the petitioner for her appointment in terms of the order dated 6-
8-2010 have been refused time and again: no appeal was preferred by her
thereagainst. Consequently, the common order dated 25-1-2012 has
attained finality and shall now operate as res judicata between the petitioner
and the State-respondents. This Court cannot keep on issuing the same
order ad nauseam. I am not, however, oblivious of the fact that the
petitioner must have exhausted all the means available at her disposal by
now and can ill-afford to approach the Apex Court at this stage, but the
enormous hardship already faced by her cannot be a ground for granting the
reliefs claimed by her when her case is now barred by the principles of res
judicata. There were twenty vacant posts of Zoology Subject Teachers for
WP(C) No. 2485/12                                                         Page 23 of 24

which the impugned recruitment process was held, but she admittedly did
not make it to the top 20 of the select list. How could she then be appointed
at the expense of the more meritorious candidates? As for the illegalities and
irregularities highlighted by her, these were already gone into and decided,
rightly or wrongly, by the Division Bench of this Court and, in the absence of
appeal, have now attained finality. This Court cannot come into the
assistance of the petitioner unless she proves that her legal or constitutional
right is violated by the respondent authorities.
21.      The offshoot of the foregoing discussion is that there is no merit in
this writ petition, which is, therefore, dismissed. Considering the public
service rendered by the petitioner in exposing the scandalous recruitment
scam in the Education (Secondary) Department, Assam which, I hope, will
go a long way in eliminating or minimising the extent of corruption in the
Department, I direct the Education (Secondary) Department to pay another
₹25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand) only to her by way of cost within
one month from the date of receipt of this judgment.
                                                                   JUDGE
