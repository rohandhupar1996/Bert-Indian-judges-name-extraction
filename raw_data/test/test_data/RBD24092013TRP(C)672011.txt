                  TRP (C)NO.67 OF 2011
9. 24.9.2013           This is a petition under Section 24 of the Civil
             Procedure Code for transfer of C.P. No.97 of 2011 from
             the Court of the learned Judge, Family Court, Puri to the
             Court of the learned Judge, Family Court, Cuttack.
             Petitioner is the wife and opposite party is the husband.
             2.        The petitioner-wife has sought for transfer of the
             case on the ground that she being a lady aged about 32 is
             facing a lot of inconvenience in attending the Court at
             Puri which is 120 kilometers away from her place of
             residence, i.e., her parental house, more so when there is
             no other male member to accompany her during her
             journey and that the financial condition of her parents
             being quite precarious she is unable to meet the travel
             expenses in order to attend the Court at Puri. Reliance on
             the decision in Pratibha Khemka v. Sanjay Kumar
             Khemka, reported in 2005 (II) OLR (SC) 190 is placed
             wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court have observed that
             the convenience of the lady has to be kept in mind while
             considering a petition for transfer of a matrimonial case.
             Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that since it is
             very much inconvenient on the part of the petitioner to
             appear before the learned Judge, Family Court, Puri, the
             case should be transferred to the Court at Cuttack.
             3.        Learned counsel for the opposite party objects to
             the petition for transfer contending that the grounds
             taken in the petition are not sufficient and that if the case
             is transferred as prayed for, then the opposite party would
             suffer greater inconvenience.
             4.        In Kamaljit Kaur v. Prince Singh Chhabra,
             reported in 2006 (I) OLR (SC) 456, the wife’s petition for

                              2
transfer    of    C.P.  Case No.163 of 2004 from the
Family    Court,    Rourkela,   Orissa   to  Family   Court,
Dhanbad, Jharkhand was disallowed as the ground taken
in the petition that being a lady it was not safe for her to
travel from Dhanbad to Rourkela was held to be no
ground for transfer at all.
5.        In the case at hand, the only ground is the
inconvenience on the part of the petitioner to suffer the
journey. There is direct communication between Cuttack
and Puri. The distance is 120 kilometers only. Therefore,
on the ground of inconvenience the petition for transfer
cannot be allowed. However, in order to meet the other
ground raised by the petitioner that she cannot meet the
expenditure on account of the journey, the opposite party-
husband can be asked to pay the travel expenses on each
and every occasion when the petitioner is required to
come to Puri to attend the Court.
6.        It is considered just and appropriate to ask the
opposite party to pay a sum of Rs.400/- (Rupees four
hundred) to the petitioner on each and every occasion she
is required by the learned Judge, Family Court, Puri to
attend the Court in person. The amount towards journey
expenses should be paid to the petitioner on the very date
of her appearance before the learned Judge, Family Court,
Puri and in case the petitioner refuses to accept the same
then the amount be deposited in the Court on the same
date. In case the opposite party fails to pay the amount on
any occasion without there being sufficient reason, then

                           3
the petitioner shall be at liberty to renew her prayer
for transfer of the case.
          With the aforesaid observation, the TRP (C) is
disposed of.
