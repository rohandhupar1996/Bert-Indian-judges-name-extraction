                 For the petitioner               : Mr. P.K.R. Choudhury,
                                                     Md. A. Khan,

                                                     Mr. N.G. Kundu.            … Advocates.

                                          JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                                 Heard Mr. P.K. Roychoudhury, the learned Counsel appearing for
                 the petitioner. The respondent M/s Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL)
                 and their officers are represented by the learned Counsel Mr. P.J. Saikia. The
                 private respondents 5 & 6 have filed their respective counter affidavit(s) but
                 none appears on their behalf, during the hearing.
                 2.              The petitioner offered his candidature for the retail outlet at
                 Karimganj advertised by the BPCL on 2.7.1998 (Annexure-I). After the Dealer
                 Selection Board (DSB) evaluated the applicants, three persons were shortlisted
                 and the petitioner was placed at Sl. No.3 and the respondents 5 & 6 were placed
                 at the 1st and 2nd position respectively, in the Select List (Annexure-III).
                 3.              Being aggrieved by the recommendation of the DSB, the petitioner
                 made representation for reconsideration and since decision was delayed, he filed
                 the WP(C) No.5418/2001, which was disposed of on 4.8.2001 (Annexure-X) with
                 simple direction to the respondents to dispose of the petitioner’s representation,
                 before allotment letter for the dealership is issued to the selected candidate.
WP(C) No.5388/2008
                                                                                 Page 2 of 6

                                                          3
                 4.             The primary ground in the petitioner’s representation against
                 selection of the private respondents was that, both the respondents were
                 involved in criminal cases. Under Clause 4 of the advertisement, the candidates
                 convicted of any criminal offence involving moral turpitude/economic offence and
                 those against whom charge has been framed by the Court, were ineligible for the
                 dealership in question.
                 5.             In pursuant to the Court’s direction in the WP(C) No.5418/2001,
                 the competent authority of the BPCL examined the nature of involvement of the
                 private respondents in criminal cases and noted that the 1st assessed candidate
                 Sudhangshu Das (respondent No.5) was not involved with any offence involving
                 moral turpitude/economic offence and therefore it was held that he is not
                 disqualified under Clause 4 of the advertisement. It was further noted that in the
                 G.R. Case No.460/1992, the first summon was served on Sudhangshu Das on
                 16.6.2001 after he offered his candidature for dealership and therefore the said
                 summon was considered irrelevant. For the G.R. Case No.1241/1992, the
                 competent authority observed that this was a frivolous case for violation of
                 Section 144 Cr.P.C. and Charge was yet to be framed by the Court. Accordingly it
                 was opined that there is no disqualification to the candidature of the respondent
                 No.5 Sudhangshu Das, who was empanelled in the 1st position by the DSB. Thus
                 the representation of the third placed writ petitioner was rejected, by the order
                 dated 25.2.2002 (Annexure-XII), passing the way for commissioning the outlet at
                 Karimganj.
                 6.             Following the decision of the competent authority, a Letter of
                 Intent (LOI) was issued on 28.2.2003 (Annexure-XIII) in favour of the 5th
                 respondent for the retail outlet at Karimganj. But at that stage, mass allegation
                 cropped up relating to selection of politically affiliated person for dealerships
                 under the Public Sector Oil Companies and eventually direction was issued by the
                 Central Government to cancel allotment of all Petrol Pumps made with
                 recommendation of the DSBs, since 1.1.2000. Hence consequential action was
                 taken by the BPCL to cancel the LOI issued to the respondent No.5.
                 7.             Aggrieved by the cancellation of allotment, the respondent No.5
                 filed the WP(C) No.5160/2002 to challenge the order dated 14.8.2002 and in this
                 case stay order was passed by the High Court on 18.8.2002.

                                                                              Page 3 of 6

                                                            4
                 8.               Eventually the Supreme Court disposed of the cases pending
                 before it and in Onkar Lal Bajaj vs. Union of India reported in (2003) 2 SCC 673,
                 the issue of tainted allotment was considered and the Apex Court indicated that
                 en-bloc cancellation because of anomolous allotment in few cases was not
                 justified, since allegations were levelled only in respect of about 10% of the total
                 selection. Consequential direction was issued for constituting a Committee to
                 examine      specific   cases  of   wrongful   allotment.   Thereafter  the  WP(C)
                 No.5160/2002 was withdrawn by the 5th respondent as his LOI was intended to
                 be made operational by the Oil Company.
                 9.               At that stage, the present petitioner filed a 2nd case i.e. WP(C)
                 No.7427/2002 for cancellation of the dealership granted to the 5th respondent
                 and this case was disposed of by the High Court on 14.6.2007 (Annexure-XXIII)
                 by directing the respondent authorities to consider the grievances of the writ
                 petitioner and to pass appropriate orders as may be justified, in the facts of the
                 case.
                 10.               Following the High Court direction, the competent authority of the
                 BPCL examined the representation filed by the petitioner and noted that the
                 petitioner never challenged the marks received by him or awarded to the private
                 respondents on the basis of which, the merit of the candidature were assessed.
                 On the criminal cases pertaining to the private respondents, the previous
                 speaking order passed on 25.2.2002 (Annexure-XII) was taken into account to
                 conclude that those factors do not disqualify the private respondents. The issue
                 of political affiliation of the private respondents was then considered and the
                 authority noted that such affiliation doesn’t disqualify any candidate. More
                 importantly, the awarding of marks by the DSB was on merit and not because of
                 political leanings and thus no reason was found for granting the representation
                 filed by the writ petitioner and hence the selection was upheld, through the
                 impugned order dated 13.2.2008 (Annexure-XXIV).
                 11.1             Assailing the legality of the order passed by the competent
                 authority of the BPCL, Mr. P.K. Roychoudhury, the learned Counsel submits that
                 the respondents are disqualified under Clause 4 as they were involved in criminal
WP(C) No.5388/2008
                                                                                Page 4 of 6

                                                            5
                 cases and accordingly it is argued that undeserving persons were recommended
                 by the DSB for the dealership at Karimganj.
                 11.2            Referring to the political affiliation of the two private respondents,
                 the learned Counsel argues that this had influenced their selection and on that
                 basis, the order passed by the competent authority on 13.2.2008 (Annexure-
                 XXIV) is contended to be unjustified.
                 12.1            On the other hand, Mr. P.J. Saikia, the learned Counsel submits
                 that selection was made on merit of the candidates and he refers to two
                 speaking orders passed in pursuant to this Court’s direction to project that even
                 after scrutinizing the selection process, no infirmity was found in the selection of
                 the private respondents.
                 12.2            Referring to Clause 4 of the advertisement, Mr. Saikia argues that
                 involvement in cases of moral turpitude/economic offence is the only
                 disqualifying factor and when the candidates are not tainted with any case of this
                 category, their candidatures are contended to be valid and eligible.
                 12.3            The learned Counsel further submits that the respondent No.5 had
                 not received any summon in the G.R. Case No.460/1992 when he offered his
                 candidature. Moreover the G.R. Case No.1241/1992 is a simple case of violation
                 of Section 144 Cr.P.C. where Charge was not framed at the stage when the
                 respondent No.5 offered his candidature. Accordingly it is argued that the
                 candidature of the respondent No.5 was valid and he was selected on merit.
                 13.             The Supreme Court in Mukund Swarup Mishra vs. Union of India
                 reported in (2007) 2 SCC 536 noted the ratio in Onkar Lal Bajaj (supra) and
                 observed that merely because a person is politically connected, should not
                 disentitle him/her from allotment, if the candidate is found meritorious by the
                 DSB and the political connection should not stand in the way of selection of a
                 meritorious candidate. Only when the political connection of an applicant has
                 influenced the selection, the resultant allotment is open to challenge, as
                 extraneous factors have influenced the selection.
                 14.             In the present case, the petitioner has failed to present any
                 material either before the competent authority or in this Court wherefrom it can
WP(C) No.5388/2008
                                                                                  Page 5 of 6

                                                          6
                 be inferred that selection was not made on the merit of the candidates. If the
                 political connection of the recommended candidates played no role, in light of the
                 decision in Mukund Swarup Mishra (supra) and Onkar Lal Bajaj (supra), the
                 legality of the exercise undertaken by the DSB can’t be questioned by an
                 unsuccessful candidate.
                 15.             As regards the challenge made to the selection by referring to the
                 criminal cases, the speaking order passed by the competent authority on
                 25.2.2002 (Annexure-XII) is scrutinized and I find that all relevant factors were
                 taken into account to declare that the recommended candidates are not
                 disqualified under Clause 4 of the advertisement. Appreciating the basis and the
                 logic of the order(s) passed by the authority on 25.2.2002 (Annexure-XII) and on
                 13.2.2008 (Annexure-XXIV), it is declared that these two orders whereby the
                 selection of the private respondents by the DSB was upheld, do not suffer from
                 any infirmity.
                 16.             The writ petitioner as the unsuccessful candidate has repeatedly
                 challenged the selection process and this is the 3rd writ petition filed by him. The
                 Court is informed that the dealership at Karimganj has already been
                 commissioned and the respondent No.5 is managing the same. When the
                 selection appears to have been made on merit without being influenced by any
                 extraneous factors and finding the decision making process to be in order and
                 accepting the logic and the reasoning of the impugned order passed by the
                 competent authority of BPCL on 13.2.2008 (Annexure-XXIV), this writ petition is
                 found devoid of any merit and the same is accordingly dismissed. But in the facts
                 and circumstances of the case, the parties will bear their respective cost.
                                                                                              JUDGE
