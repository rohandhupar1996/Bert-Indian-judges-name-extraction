                                      BEFORE
                     THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE B.K. SHARMA
Date of hearing & Judgement:                        24/08/2015
                         JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
1.     This writ petition is against the order dated 08/12/2009 of the learned
Member, Foreigners Tribunal, Dibrugarh passed in Case No. FT 82/07 (P.E. No.
407/02) (State Vs. Md. Kader Khan). By the said order, the petitioner has been
declared to be a foreigners.
2.     I have heard Mr. M.H. Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also
heard Mr. Noor Mohammad, learned State Counsel and so also Mr. S.C. Keyal,
learned ASGI. I have also perused the entire materials on record along with the LCR
received from the learned Tribunal.
3.     As recorded in the impugned order, the petitioner could not produce any
relevant document in support of his claim of Indian citizenship. The Tribunal upon a
threadbare discussion of the evidence on record, found the following discrepancies :-
       i)      In the written statement filed by the petitioner, he categorically stated
               that he was born in Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh on 02/02/1983.
               However, while deposing before the Tribunal he stated that he was
               born at Ketetong PHC under Margherita. On the other hand, his father
               i.e. DW-6 in his statement stated that his son i.e. the petitioner was
               born at Margherita.
WP(C) 238 /10 oral dated 24/08/15                            Page 2 of 9

       ii)     Although it was the stand of the petitioner that his father i.e. DW-6
               had married one Smt. Mustri Begum in 1980 but could not lead any
               evidence to show that Smt. Mustri Begum was his mother.
       iii)    In the written statement, the petitioner did not deny the following
               paragraphs of the enquiry report based on which he was suspected to
               be a foreigner. The written statement filed by him did not deal with
               the said paragraphs, which are quoted below :_
                       “(10) Does the person hold any passport issued by any
                       foreign country … . No.
                       (11)   W hat are the reasons for living the persons
                       country of origin ? … . For his livelihood.
                       (13)   If the person has entered in to India w ithout a
                       passport, how the person entered India ? … . W ithout
                       valid Travel Docum ents.
                       Nam e of the village/ district from w hich the person
                       entered ? .. Vill- Putina, P.S. R upganj, Dist.- Dacca,
                       Bangladesh.
                       Date of entry ? … .. after 25 th M arch, 1971.”
               That apart, in para 12 of the written statement, referring to para 14 to
22 of the enquiry report, the petitioner simply stated that the same were matters of
record, unmindful of the fact that under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, the
burden was on him to prove that he is an Indian citizen.
       iv)     When the Tribunal by way of clarification put some question to the
               petitioner, he clarified that the place Ketetong is under Margherita
               PS and the place of his residence, namely, Bessakopi is under
               Doomdooma Police Station. He admitted that he did not know in which
               village of Ketetong he was born. In the written statement, he did not
               state that his grandfather’s originally was from U.P. He also admitted
               that Ketetong and Margherita are two different places.
WP(C) 238 /10 oral dated 24/08/15                             Page 3 of 9

4.       As regards the evidence led by DW-3, Smt. Tutumoni Moran, President of
Mankhowa Gaon Panchayat, who had issued the residential certificate in favour of
the petitioner, admitted that the certificate was issued on the basis of the letter
addressed to her by the jurisdictional MLA. The Tribunal perused the Ext. 1 letter of
the MLA and on perusal of the same evidence that instruction was issued to DW-3 to
issue the residential certificate to the petitioner.
5.       DW-4 Smt. Saruja Das, Head Mistress of Jawahar Hindi High English
School, who had issued the certificate of admission stated that the petitioner was a
student of her school. The certificate so issued showed that the petitioner was
admitted in 1996 only. Thus, the certificate is of no help to the case of the
petitioner, the cut-off date being 25/03/1971.
6.       DW-6 i.e. the father of the petitioner deposed that he belongs to U.P. and
come to the present place of living in 1964 along with his mother. He identified him
as the son of Jainuddin Khan. He also stated that his son i.e. the petitioner was
born in Margherita twon in 1983. According to him, since last 45 years they had
been living at Bisakopie . According to him, he got himself admitted in Hindi L.P.
School, Doomdooma and studied up to Class-III. He also stated that he used to
cast vote since 1970. However, as per the deposition of DW-5, the Head Mistress of
Hindi L.P. School, Doomdooma, the DW-6 was admitted in 1972 and as per the
certificate he was 10 years 5 months and 5 days as on 31/12/1972. Thus, he
was only 8 years old in 1970 and as such the learned Tribunal rightly has held that
the petitioner’s father could not have been a voter in 1970.
7.       Evidence of PW-6 also failed to prove the plea of the petitioner that he was
born either at Assam Medical College Hospital or Ketetong PHC, inasmuch as,
as per the deposition his original house was at U.P. On the other hand, this witness in
his deposition stated that he used to visit his Maternal Uncle and Nana/Nani
(maternal grand parents) in U.P.
WP(C) 238 /10 oral dated 24/08/15                            Page 4 of 9

8.      The medical certificate on which the petitioner placed reliance made shocking
revelation of issuance of such forged and false certificate. The relevant portion of the
discussion made by the Tribunal is quoted below :
               “DW 7 is the register of death & Birth of Ketetong P.H.C. under
               M argherita subdivision. This w itness deposed that since 25
               years he has been serving in different capacity at K etetong
               P.H.C. and he issued death and birth certificates. He used to
               issue birth certificate on the basis of P.R.C., Gaonbura and
               Hospital’s certificates. After 21 days of birth, for a birth
               registration certificate one have to be paid R s. 15 through
               Treasury     Challan   as   late   fine    along    w ith  SDO(Civil)’s
               perm ission.
               Ex t. “Ja” is the birth certificate issued by him . Ex . Ja(1) is his
               signature. Ex-Ja w as issued in the nam e of one Quadir K han,
               S/ O. M d. Faruk K han, M other Sm t. M ustari Begum . Regarding
               issuing of birth certificate the Hospital used to kep record on
               it but the record of the instanht certificate could not be
               produced by him , as on 19-9-09 Ketetong hospital including
               its records w ere destroyed in a devastating fire.
               The face of DW / 7 Dr. Jiten Saikia w as seen to be very fam iliar
               and to that effect questions w ere put by the Court to DW 7 for
               few clarification. To such questions Dr. Jiten Saikia adm itted
               that earlier also he cam e to this court to prove birth
               certificates issued by him and at that tim e also he could not
               produce any official record in the court. As such it is an
               adm itted fact that, before dam aging the Hospital records by
               fire on 19-9-09 Dr. Saikia could not produce official records.
WP(C) 238 /10 oral dated 24/08/15                             Page 5 of 9

               In cross DW 7 adm itted that, the so called birth certificates
               w as issued after 24 years of birth. Date of registration of the
               certificate w as 31-12-07 and issued it after 10 m onths. Place
               of birth and place of original address m entioned as Bisakopie,
               P.S., dist, State of Bisakopie not m entioned. It is also not
               m entioned w hether o.p. w as born in hospital or in ow n house.
               He further clarified that M argherita C.H.C. and K etetong P.H.C.
               are the authority of issuing birth certificate of M argherita
               subdivision. Bisakopie is under Doom doom a P.S. not under
               M argherita subdivision. Birth certificate of Bisakopie w as to
               be issued by the Doom doom a P.H.C. not by K etetong. As per
               the statem ent of o.p. he issued the certificate show ing the
               place of birth at Bisakopie not at M argherita tow n or at
               K etetong. DW 7 further adm itted that Bisakopie is not under
               M argherita.
               From the evidence of DW 7 it appears that Ex-Ja the birth
               certificate is a false and foreged one.”
9.      As per the petitioner’s version, he was born at Assam Medical College,
Dibrugarh but on the other hand as per the father’s (DW-6) version, he was born at
Margherita. Again the petitioner in his deposition before the Tribunal stated that he
was born at Ketetong PHC.
10.     Above being the position coupled with the detailed discussion made by the
learned Member, Foreigners Tribunal in reference to the evidence on record and also
the written argument submitted by the petitioner, I see no reason to interfere with
the findings arrived at by the learned Tribunal sitting on appeal over the findings like
an appellate authority. The Full Bench of this Court in State of Assam Vs. M oslem
M ondal and others reported in 2013 (1) GLT 809 while discussing the scope,
ambit and jurisdiction of the Writ Court in such matter has observed thus :-
WP(C) 238 /10 oral dated 24/08/15                            Page 6 of 9

       “112. Article 226 of the Constitution confers on the High Court
       pow er to issue appropriate w rit to any person or authority w ithin its
       territorial jurisdiction. The Tribunal constituted under the 1946 Act
       read w ith the 1964 Order, as noticed above, is required to discharge
       the quasi-judicial function. The High Court, therefore, has the pow er
       under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue w rit of certiorari
       quashing the decision of the Tribunal in an appropriate case. The
       scope of interference w ith the Tribunal's order, in ex ercise of the
       jurisdiction under Article 226, how ever, is lim ited. The w rit of
       certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of jurisdiction, as and
       w hen the inferior Court or Tribunal acts w ithout jurisdiction or in
       excess of it, or fails to exercise it or if such Court or Tribunal acts
       illegally in exercise of its undoubted jurisdiction, or w hen it decides
       w ithout giving an opportunity to the parties to be heard or violates
       the principles of natural justice. The certiorari jurisdiction of the w rit
       Court being supervisory and not appellate jurisdiction, the Court
       cannot review the findings of facts reached by the inferior Court or
       Tribunal. There is, how ever, an exception to the said general
       proposition, in as m uch as, the w rit of certiorari can be issued and
       the decision of a Tribunal on a finding of fact can be interfered w ith,
       if in recording such a finding the Tribunal has acted on evidence
       w hich is legally inadm issible or has refused to adm it adm issible
       evidence or if the finding is not supported by any evidence at all,
       because in such cases such error w ould am ount to an error of law
       apparent on the face of the record. The other errors of fact, how ever
       grave it m ay be, cannot be corrected by a w rit court. As noticed
       above, the judicial review of the order passed by the inferior Court
       or the Tribunal, in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of
       the Constitution, is lim ited to correction of errors apparent on the
       face of the record, w hich also takes w ithin its fold a case w here a
       statutory authority ex ercising its discretionary jurisdiction did not
WP(C) 238 /10 oral dated 24/08/15                        Page 7 of 9

       take into consideration a relevant fact or renders its decision on
       w holly irrelevant factors. Hence, the failure of taking into account
       the relevant facts or consideration of irrelevant factors, w hich has a
       bearing on the decision of the inferior court or the Tribunal, can be a
       ground for interference of the Court or Tribunal's decision in
       exercise of the w rit jurisdiction by the High Court.
       113. The Apex Court in Sant Lal Gupta Vs. M odern Coop. Group
       Housing Society Ltd. reported in (2010)13 SCC 336, reiterating the
       grounds on w hich a w rit of certiorari can be issued, has opined that
       such a w rit can be issued only w hen there is a failure of justice and
       cannot be issued m erely because it m ay be legally perm issible to do
       so. It is obligatory on the part of the petitioners to show that a
       jurisdictional error has been com m itted by the statutory authority.
       There m ust be an error apparent on the face of the record, as the
       High Court acts m erely in a supervisory capacity and not as the
       appellate authority. An error apparent on the face of the records
       m eans an error w hich strikes one on m ere looking and does not need
       long draw n out process of reasoning on points w here there m ay
       conceivably be tw o opinions. Such error should not require any
       ex traneous m atters to show its incorrectness. Such error m ay
       include giving reasons that are bad in law              or inconsistent,
       unintelligible or inadequate. It m ay also include the application of a
       w rong legal test to the facts found, taking irrelevant consideration
       into account and failing to take relevant consideration into account,
       and w rongful adm ission or exclusion of evidence as w ell as arriving
       at a conclusion w ithout any supporting evidence. Such a w rit can
       also be issued w hen there is an error in jurisdiction or authority
       w hose order is to be review ed has acted w ithout jurisdiction or in
       excess of its jurisdiction or has failed to exercise the jurisdiction
       vested in him by law .”

6.      In view of the above, the writ petition is dismissed. Now, the Superintendent
of Police (B), Dibrugarh shall ensure that the petitioner is arrested and detained in
the detention camp till his deportation to his country of origin i.e. Bangladesh.
7.      Let the matter be listed again after one month so as to submit report by the
Superintendent of Police (B) Dibrugarh about the action taken in the terms of this
order.
8.      The Deputy Commissioner, Dibrugarh shall ensure deletion of the name of the
petitioner from the voter list, if any.
9.      Registry shall send down the case records to the learned court below along
with a copy of this judgement and order. A copy of the judgement and order may
also be furnished to Mr. Noor Mohammad, learned State Counsel for his immediate
necessary follow up action. Copies shall also be sent to the SP(B), Dibrugarh and
Deputy Commissioner, Dibrugarh, for their immediate follow up action.
