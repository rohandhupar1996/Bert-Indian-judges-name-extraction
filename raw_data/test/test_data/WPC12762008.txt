                                           Mr. S. P. Upadhaya, Advocates.
For the Respondents:                       Ms. A. Gayan, Central Govt. Counsel.
Date of hearing & judgment:                18.08.2015.
                                JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
         Heard Mr. S. Chouhan, the learned counsel for the petitioner. The respondents
are represented by Ms. A. Gayan, the learned Central Govt. Counsel (CGC).
2.       The petitioner was a Constable in the 57th Battalion of the Border Security Force
(BSF) and while he was on Naka duty along with Head Constable Dwarika Prasad, both
members of the ‘G’ Coy Unit were placed under suspension by the Commandant of the
57th Battalion of the BSF Patiram (WB), by the order dated 7.6.2007 (Annexure-A).
According to the suspension order, the two BSF men had facilitated crossing of 15 cattle
to Bangladesh at about 3:00 Hrs. on 7.6.2007 by opening the Fencing Gate No.19.
3.       A Court of Inquiry (COI) was constituted to investigate into the circumstances of
the cattle crossing over to Bangladesh and before the Inquiry Officer, the delinquent
constable stated that it was the Head Constable Dwarika Prasad who opened the Gate
and it was further stated by him that the Head Constable had himself dealt with the
Writ Petition (C) No.1276/2008                                                        Page 1 of 3

cattle smugglers, from whom payment was expected to be received. The Head
Constable Dwarika Prasad in his statement before the COI admitted that he opened the
fencing gate and he further stated that the payment for facilitating the cattle cross over
was to be received later. Consequently the Court of Inquiry opined that both the Head
Constable and the Constable are blameworthy for facilitating cattle smuggling through
Gate No.19 and accordingly strict disciplinary action was recommended against the two
errant personnel.
4.       The proceeding of the Court of Inquiry was partially approved by the
Commandant by observing that disciplinary action should also be taken against another
Head Constable Rai Singh, who while on patrolling duty, had failed to detect the
opening of the border gate and the cattle crossing.
5.       Thereafter a Summary Security Force Court Proceeding (hereinafter referred to
as ‘the Summary Court’) was started under Chapter-XI of the Border Security Force
Rules, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the BSF Rules’). The Summary Court sought the
response of the charged personnel when the delinquent constable pleaded guilty to the
charge. But since non-guilty plea was entered by the Head Constable, the Summary
Court went into the merit of the charges. Eventually guilty verdict was given against
both the Head Constable and the Constable. Then the previous records of the two
delinquents were taken into account and the Summary Court referred the matter to the
disciplinary authority. In consequence of the recommendation of the Summary Court,
the disciplinary authority imposed the punishment of dismissal from service and ordered
that the names of the two delinquents be struck off from the BSF Unit w.e.f. 13.6.2007
(Annexure-J). The aggrieved constable approached the Appellate Authority but the
Director General, BSF rejected the Appeal Through the order dated 4.10.2007
(Annexure-L).
6.       The petitioner contends that Head Constable Dwarika Prasad was the custodian
of the key and the evidence shows that he himself opened the BSF Fencing Gate to
facilitate the movement of cattle to Bangladesh and therefore it is argued that the
petitioner being a sub-ordinate personnel under the Post Commander, should not have
been meted out the same punishment as the Head Constable.
7.       Mr. S. Chouhan, learned counsel refers to Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 101 of the BSF
Rules to project that mitigating factors should have been considered by the Authorities
before deciding on the punishment and according to him because the major role in the
cattle smuggling incident was of the Head Constable, the punishment of dismissal from
service is disproportionate for his subordinate.

8.       Ms. A. Gayan, the learned C.G.C. refers to the counter affidavit filed by the
respondents on 29.5.2008 to argue that the delinquent constable was given the
opportunity to highlight the mitigating circumstances for the proposed sentence. But
unfortunately the C.G.C. was unable to show in what manner the Authorities had
compared relative culpability of the Post Commander and his subordinate.
9.       In the present matter, when the delinquent constable has pleaded guilty to the
charge, the conclusion of the Summary Court is not amenable to challenge by the
delinquent constable. But at the same time, it is important to scrutinize whether both
the Constable and the Head Constable deserves similar punishment because dissimilar
roles are ascribed to them, in the cattle smuggling incident.
10.      As earlier noted, the Head Constable admitted that he opened the Fencing Gate
to facilitate the cattle crossing over to Bangladesh and as the Post Commander, he was
the custodian of the keys of the border gate. The evidence also shows that the Post
Commander had undertaken negotiations with the cattle smugglers but allegation of
interaction with the cattle smugglers is not ascribed to the petitioner.
11.      As a result of the above discussion and noticing that the differential factors were
not taken into account by the Authorities while imposing the same punishment on the
Post Commander and his subordinate, I feel that the punishment for the constable is
required to be revisited by the authorities. The various punishments awardable by the
Security Force Court are specified in Section 48 of the Border Security Force Act, 1968
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the BSF Act’ ) and apart from dismissal, other punishment
options are available under Section 48(1)(c) of the BSF Act. In my view the mitigating
factors in respect of the delinquent constable were not taken into account by the BSF
authorities and therefore the punishment of dismissal against the petitioner is held to be
disproportionate and the same is accordingly quashed. The matter is thus remitted back
to the disciplinary authority for consideration of alternate punishment, by taking into
account the lesser role of the delinquent in the cattle smuggling incident. It is ordered
accordingly.
12.      With the above direction, the case is partially allowed to the extent indicated,
without any order on cost.
                                                                                    JUDGE
Barman.
