                                                  BEFORE
                              THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE B.K. SHARMA
Date of hearing & Judgement:                         25/08/2015
                       JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
1.      The petitioner is aggrieved by order dated 28/06/2013 of the Foreigners
Tribunal-III, Barpeta, passed in case No. FT Case No. 04(III)/2013 (Ref.
IMDT Case No. 1595/01) (State Vs. Rahim Ali @ Rahimuddin), by which
the petitioner has been declared to be a foreigner.
2.      Heard Mr. M.U. Mahmud, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard
Mr. Noor Mohammad, learned State Counsel and so also Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned
ASGI. I have also perused the entire materials on record including the LCR
received from the Tribunal.
3.      In the written statement filed before the Tribunal, the petitioner
contended that he was born and brought up at Village Fingwa in the district of
Barpeta. He also contended that his grandfather’s name (Abed Ali) appeared in
the voter list of 1965 along with his Uncles and mother. He also contended that
his Uncle’s name (Sukur Ali) appeared in the voters’ list of 1971 and that his
own name along with his wife Rezia Khatun appeared in the voters’ list of
1997.
4.     Above were the grounds projected by the petitioner to claim that he is an
Indian citizen. The learned Tribunal discussing the evidence on record has
returned the following findings in para 9 of the impugned judgement :-
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                            Page 2 of 10

        “a)   In the instant case, the OP has projected late Abed Ali
        S/ o. R iazuddin as his grandfather and Late K udus Ali as his
        father. But except the statem ent of the OP m ade in his
        Affidavit, there is no corroborative or any trustw orthy evidence
        on record to show that Late Abed Ali s/ o R iazuddin, w hose
        nam e appears as a voter in the voters’ list of 1965 (Ex -A), is the
        grandfather of the OP or Late Kuddus Ali (the projected father
        of the OP) is the son of said Abed Ali. The linkage certificate
        (Ex -F) show s that one Rahim uddin (OP in this case) s/ o.
        K uddus Ali (even if it is accepted that R ahim Ali and
        R ahim uddin is one and the sam e person) is a resident of village
        Finguw a but there is nothing in Ex -F to show that Late K udus
        Ali w as the son of Late Abed Ali and or the aforesaid
        R ahim uddin w as born in that village. It is sated in Ex-F that the
        nam e of the father of R ahim uddin appears w ritten in Ex -A but
        on careful perusal of Ex-A it appears clear that there is nothing
        to show that R ahim uddin is the son of Kuddus or that the nam e
        of any Kuddus Ali is show n in Ex -A as a voter.
        (b)   The OP has further stated in his evidence in chief that his
        father died before 1965 and that his grandfather died after
        1965. By saying so he w ants to convey that because his father
        died before 1965, his (his father’s) nam e did not appear in Ex -
        A. Further if the statem ent of the OP to the effect that his
        father died before 1965 is accepted as true, the statem ent that
        his (OP’s) nam e appeared in Ex-C and Ex -D along w ith the
        nam e of his step m other Sibarun Nessa cannot be accepted as
        true because if Sibarun Nessa is his step m other than she
        should have m arried OP’s father before his (father of OP) death
        i.e. before 1965 and in that case her nam e should also have
        been recorded in Ex-A along w ith the nam e of the actual
        projected m other of the OP, nam ely Yarian. In Ex -C the age of
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                        Page 3 of 10

        Sibaran Nessa (the projected step m other of the OP) is
        recorded as 60 years in 1989 and if it is so, she should have
        born in or about 1929 and as such she w as eligible to be a voter
        in 1950 (after 21 years from the date of her birth i.e. 1929). If
        her (Projected step m other of the OP) nam e appears in Ex-C
        and Ex-D it can w ell be presum ed that she w as alive at least till
        1997 but there is no ex planation or clarification on record as to
        w hy her nam e w as not recorded in any of the voters’ lists of
        1965, 1970, 1971 and 1985 and as to w hy no such voters’ list
        show ing her nam e has been subm itted and proved in this case.
        (c)   The OP has stated that the nam es of his uncles Hayat Ali,
        Pulm at Ali and Sukur Ali are recorded in Ex -A but there is
        nothing on record to show as to w hy the voters’ list of 1970
        show ing their nam es therein could not be filed. The am ended
        voters’ list of 1971 (Ex -B) also did not show the nam es of Hayat
        Ali and Pulm at Ali as voters. It show s only the nam e of Sukur
        Ali and his tw o w ives. None of the aforesaid projected uncles of
        the OP has been ex am ined as a w itness in this case to prove
        that the OP is the son of their ow n brother Late K uddus Ali.
        (d)   If w e go through the cross-ex am ination portion of OP’s
        evidence, w e get som e m ore interesting facts. In the Affidavit
        filed by the OP along w ith his w ritten statem ent as w ell as in
        the evidence-in-chief filed by him on Affidavit, the OP has
        m entioned his age as 53 years in 2013. He has also adm itted in
        his cross-ex am ination that his present age is 53 years.
        Therefore, according to his ow n declaration and statem ent on
        oath he should have been born in or about 1960. In his cross-
        ex am ination, the OP has stated that his father died w hen he
        w as about 12 years of age. If that is so, his father m ust have
        been alive at least till 1972 ahd as such the statem ent of the OP
        m ade in his evidence-in-chief as w ell as in his w ritten argum ent
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                        Page 4 of 10

        to the effect that his father died before 1965 or 1966 is
        apparently incorrect. The aforesaid statem ents w ere m ade, in
        m y considered view , to convey and to m ake this Tribunal
        believe that his father’s nam e did not appear in Ex -A because
        he (the projected father of the OP) died prior to 1965 or 1966.
        (e)   The OP has further stated in his cross-exam ination that
        his step m other died after about five years of the death of his
        father. This statem ent is also self contradictory because in his
        evidence-in-chief, he has specifically stated that the nam e of
        his step m other is recorded in the voters’ lists of 1989 and 1997
        w hich he has ex hibited as Ex -C and Ex-D respectively in this
        case. If the father of the OP, as per OP’s ow n statem ents m ade
        in his evidence-in-chief and the w ritten argum ent, had died
        before 1965 or 1966, then as per his statem ent m ade in his
        cross-ex am ination that his step m other died after five years of
        the death of his father is apparently incorrect because in that
        case his step m other’s nam e could not have been recorded in
        the voters’ lists of 1989 (Ex -C) and 1997 (Ex -D).
       (f)    The OP has also stated in his cross-ex am ination that there
        does not appear the nam e of his father K uddus Ali as a voter in
        the voters’ lists of 1965 (Ex -A) and 1971 (Ex -B) but that it
        should have been there. He has also stated that at the tim e of
        the death of his father, his father, his uncles and other
        m em bers of their fam ilies used to live together but that he does
        not know as to w hy the nam e of his father is not recorded in
        Ex-A and Ex-B.
       (g)    In Ex-C the age of the OP is recorded as 35 years in 1989
        w hereas in Ex -D his age is recorded as 39 years in 1997 (after
        eight years from 1989). Further his age is show n as 46 years in
        Ex-E in the years 2005. There is no ex planation in this respect
        also.”
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                        Page 5 of 10

5.      Independent of the above findings, I have also verified the records of the
Tribunal in reference to the findings recorded by the learned Tribunal. Ex-A is
the voters’ list of 1965 in which the name of the father of the petitioner Kuddus
Ali does not appear. The purported linkage certificate Ex-F issued by the
Gaonbura of the particular village is in the name of Rahim Uddin, does not
show that the Late Kuddus Ali was the son of Late Abed Ali and that
Rahimuddin was born in the particular village.
6.      The petitioner in his evidence stated that his father had died before 1965
and his grandfather died after 1965. If that be so, his step mother was married
to his father before 1965. However, the petitioner placing reliance on the Ext. C
& D voters’ lists of 1989 and 1997, projected one Sibaran Nessa as his step
mother. That apart, as discussed in the judgement of the learned Tribunal, if the
step mother of the petitioner was born in 1929, her name ought to have
appeared in the voters’ lists of 1965, 1970, 1971 and 1985 but the petitioner
failed to produce any document.
7.      In the proceeding before the Tribunal, the petitioner claimed that he was
53 years of age in 2013 and if that be so he was born in or about 1960. In the
cross examination he stated that his father died when he was about 12 years of
age. In that case, his father was alive till 1972 but in his evidence in chief as
well as in his written argument, he contended that his father died before 1965.
8.      As has been held by the Apex Court in Sarbananda Sonow al Vs.
Union of India reported in AIR 2005 SC 2920 , the burden of proof lies on the
proceedee that he is not a Foreigner. The petitioner miserably failed to discharge
his burden of proof. That apart, mere exhibition of some documents without
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                              Page 6 of 10

proving the contents thereof is not enough. In this connection, para 31 of the
judgement is quoted below :-
                “31.   Under the Law of Evidence also, it is necessary that
                contents of docum ents are required to be proved either by
                prim ary or by secondary evidence. At the m ost, adm ission
                of docum ents m ay am ount to adm ission of contents but
                not its truth. Docum ents having not been produced and
                m arked as required under the Evidence Act cannot be
                relied upon by the Curt. Contents of the docum ent cannot
                be proved by m erely filing in a court.”
9.      Mr. M.U. Mahmud, learned counsel for the petitioner placing reliance on
the Division Bench judgement of this Court reported in 2015(2) GLT 617
(Abdul M atali @ M ataleb (M D) vs. Union of India and others ) submits
that the petitioner having discharged his burden of proof, the onus is shifted to
the prosecution and the said onus having not been discharged, the Tribunal
could not have passed the impugned order. In the Full Bench judgement of this
Court in State of Assam Vs. M oslem M ondal reported in 2013 (1) GLT 809 ,
discussing the issue relating to burden of proof, which has also been discussed in
Sarbananda Sonow al (Supra ), it has been held thus :-
        “78.    In a proceeding under the Foreigners Act, 1946 read w ith
        1964 Order the issue is w hether the proceedee is a foreigner. It
        being a fact especially w ithin the know ledge of the proceedee,
        the burden of proving that he is a citizen is, therefore, upon him ,
        because of Section 9 of the 1946 Act and it is, therefore, his
        obligation to provide enough evidence to establish that he is not
        a foreigner. In an ex -parte proceeding before the Tribunal
        constituted under the provisions of 1964 Order the said position
        w ould not be changed as the burden of proving that the
        proceedee is not a foreigner continues to be upon the proceedee,
        w hich cannot shift and w hen the proceedee does not adduce any
        evidence to discharge such burden, the Tribunal has no
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                             Page 7 of 10

       alternative but to opine the proceedee as a foreigner, having
       regard to the m ain grounds on w hich the reference has been
       initiated and the notice having been issued to the proceedee.
       Unlike in a suit in the Civil Court, w here the Court m ay require
       the plaintiff to adduce evidence to prove his case even in an ex -
       parte proceeding, as the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff in
       view of Section 101 of the Evidence Act, in a proceeding before
       the Tribunal under the provisions of 1946 Act read w ith 1964
       Order, the sam e is not required, m eaning thereby that the State
       is not required to adduce evidence in an ex-parte proceeding, as
       the burden lies on the proceedee to prove to the satisfaction of
       the Tribunal that he is not a foreigner, in view of the provisions
       contained in Section 9 of the 1946 Act.
       86. In M oslem M ondal's case the Division Bench, in paragraph
       53, though has rightly opined that the burden of proof under
       Section 9 of the 1946 Act is not on the State but on the person,
       w hose nationality is in question, is w ell recognized in this
       country and in paragraph 62 that it cannot be reasonably
       ex pected to have divested the State of the opportunity to adduce
       evidence in rebuttal, it has, how ever, having regard to an ex -
       parte proceeding, in paragraph 86, held that the Tribunal cannot
       render an opinion that the proceedee is a foreigner m erely
       because he did not respond to the notice and as the Tribunal,
       even in an ex-parte proceeding is required to render its opinion,
       the State cannot be absolved of its burden to prove the truth of
       the grounds on w hich they claim the proceedee to be a foreigner.
       It has further been held that if the State establishes by bringing
       such m aterials, w hich w ould establish the truth of the assertion
       m ade in the reference, the Tribunal w ould be free to give its
       opinion if it finds that the grounds are sufficient to hold the
       proceedee a foreigner. It has also been opined that the evidence
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                       Page 8 of 10

       to be given by the State w ould how ever confine to the ground on
       w hich the State rests its case and it w ill have no responsibility to
       prove, apart from the grounds w hich the State m ust prove, that
       the proceedee is not an Indian citizen. The Division Bench at the
       sam e tim e has opined that w hen it is stated that the 'burden of
       proof' is on a foreigner to prove that he is an Indian citizen, w hat
       it m eans is that if the proceedee claim s to be an Indian citizen,
       he has the burden to establish his claim of being an Indian
       citizen, because the State is not expected to prove a negative
       fact, nam ely, that the proceedee is not an Indian citizen.
       87. A Division Bench of this Court in Prafulla Sarkar (supra) has
       held that the Tribunal, in the absence of any oral evidence by the
       com plainant in support of the allegation that the petitioner w as
       a foreigner, w as not justified in relying upon Section 9 of the
       1946 Act to record the finding that the petitioner could not
       discharge his burden and therefore, he could safely be declared
       as foreign national.
       88. The aforesaid view taken by the Division Bench in M oslem
       M ondal's case, m ore particularly in paragraph 86 thereof, as w ell
       as in Prafulla Sarkar (supra) is contrary to the law laid dow n by
       the Apex Court, as discussed above, including in Sarbananda
       Sonow al(I) and Sarbananda Sonow al (II) (supra), as w ell as the
       legal provisions noticed above, particularly Section 9 of the 1946
       Act, and hence is not the correct proposition of law . The decision
       in the M oslem M ondal's case and Prafulla Sarkar (supra),
       therefore, w ould be confined to those cases only.”
10.    For all the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any merit in the writ petition
and accordingly it is dismissed. Consequent upon dismissal of the writ petition,
now the Superintendent of Police (B), Barpeta shall ensure that the petitioner is
arrested and detained in the detention camp till his deportation to his country of
WP(C) 4071/13 oral dated 25/08/15                           Page 9 of 10

origin i.e. Bangladesh. The Deputy Commissioner, Barpeta shall ensure deletion
of the name of the petitioner from the voter list, if any.
11.      Let the matter be listed again after one month so as to submit report by
the Superintendent of Police (B) Barpeta about the action taken in the terms of
this order.
12.      Registry shall send down the case records to the learned court below
along with a copy of this judgement and order. A copy of the judgement and
order may also be furnished to Mr. Noor Mohammad, learned State Counsel as
well as Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned ASGI, for their immediate necessary follow up
action. Copies shall also be sent to the SP(B), Barpeta and Deputy Commissioner,
Barpeta, for their immediate follow up action.
                                                                           JUDGE
