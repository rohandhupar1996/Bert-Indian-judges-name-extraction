                           JUDGMENT
    PRESENT:
              THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
    Date of Hearing: 23.3.2017 & Date of Judgment: 07.04.2017
Dr.A.K.RATH, J.     The defendants are the appellants against a
    reversing judgment in a suit for specific performance of
    contract.

                                2
2.           The respondent as plaintiff instituted the suit
pleading inter alia that defendant no.3 was the owner in
possession of the suit land. Defendant nos.1 and 2 are the sons
of defendant no.3. There was a family partition. The suit land
fell to the share of defendant nos.1 and 2. On 20.9.1980,
defendant nos.1 and 2 entered into an agreement with him to
sell the suit land for a consideration of Rs.6500/-. They
received an amount of Rs.1400/- towards part consideration
and thereafter delivered possession. He requested defendant
nos.1 and 2 to execute the sale deed after receiving the balance
consideration amount. He is ready and willing to perform his
part of contract. But then the defendant nos.1 and 2 in breach
of contract executed a lease deed in favour of one Sadhu Meher.
Thereafter defendant nos.1 and 2 sent a registered notice to the
plaintiff to take back the money. Hence he filed the suit seeking
the reliefs mentioned supra.
3.           Pursuant to issuance of summons, defendant nos.1
and 2 entered appearance and filed their written statement
denying the assertions made in the plaint. According to them,
there was no partition between them and their father. Their
father is the owner in possession of the suit land. They had not
entered into contract with the plaintiff to sell the suit land for
consideration of Rs.6500/-. The specific case of the defendants
is that they need money for gambling for which they incurred a
loan of R.1400/- from the plaintiff. The plaintiff obtained an
agreement. Defendant no.2 sent a registered letter requesting
the plaintiff to receive the said amount. The plaintiff never

                                  3
requested the defendants to execute the sale deed. They are in
possession of the suit land. Defendant no.3 had mortgaged the
suit land in favour of defendant no.4 for legal necessity.
4.          On the inter se pleadings of the parties, the learned
trial framed nine issues. To prove the case, the plaintiff had
examined five witnesses and on their behalf, three documents
had been exhibited.       The    defendants  had   examined five
witnesses and on their behalf, five documents had been
exhibited. The learned trial court came to hold that there was
no partition between defendants 1 to 3. Defendants 1 and 2
were not competent to execute Ext.1 in favour of the plaintiff.
Ext.1 does not show delivery of possession and the same is not
free from doubt. The suit land is a part plot and the same is not
specified. There are several cuttings and over-writings in the
boundary and description of the suit land. The boundary given
in Ext.1 does not tally with the evidence of P.W.1 and use
different ink is another suspicious circumstance. Held so, the
learned trial court dismissed the suit. Assailing the judgment
and decree of the learned trial court, the plaintiff filed Title
Appeal No.8 of 1985 before the learned District Judge, Bolangir.
Subsequently the same was transferred to the court of the
learned    Additional   District   Judge   and   renumbered    as
T.A.No.8/14 of 1985-86. The learned appellate court held that
the suit land was partitioned between defendant no.3 and his
brothers. Ext.1 was marked without objection. Its contents are
proved. Cogent evidence of partition between defendant nos. 1
to 3 cannot be expected from the plaintiff, who is a stranger to

                                 4
the family. Though there are interpolation and scorings in
Ext.1, but the recital is a strong piece of evidence to show
partition and separate possession. Other son of defendant no.3
is not a necessary party as he must have been allotted a share.
Defendant nos. 1 and 2 have executed Ext.1. Held so, the
learned lower appellate court allowed the appeal.
5.          The Second Appeal was admitted on 20.7.1989 on
the following substantial question of law:-
            “The substantial question of law arises for
            consideration is whether in the facts and
            circumstances of the case, the lower appellate
            court committed any illegality in holding that
            breach of contract can be compensated and on
            such account the judgment and decree have
            been vitiated.”
6.          Heard Mr.Budhiram Das, learned Advocate on
behalf of Mr.N.C.Pati, learned Advocate for the appellants and
Mr.N.K.Sahu, learned Advocate for the respondent.
7.          Mr.Das,    learned  Advocate    for the  appellants
submitted that the learned appellate court held that Ext.1 has
been marked as exhibit without objection and as such the
contents are proved. But then the defendants had categorically
stated in the written statement that they had not entered into
any such agreement for sale with the plaintiff. They had
received an amount of Rs.1400/- for gambling, but Ext.1 was
created for the purpose. Besides that the plaintiff had averred
that the defendants sent a registered notice to the plaintiff to

                                 5
take back the money. The finding of the learned appellate court
that the defendants have admitted execution of Ext.1, is
perverse. The plaintiff has failed to prove the alleged partition
between the co-sharers of the defendants. A Hindu family is
presumed to be joint, unless contrary is proved. Heavy onus
lies on the person who alleges partition. The plaint is silent as
to   when the alleged partition took place. There is           no
documentary     evidence     on  partition.  There  are   several
interpolations, overwriting and use of different ink in Ext.1. In
view of the same, Ext.1 is a void document. He further
submitted    that  even   if  there  is  agreement   for specific
performance, the same is the discretion of the court. The courts
will take into consideration the conduct of the parties and
circumstances of the case. The relief for specific performance
being discretionary, the court is not bound to grant such relief
merely because the agreement is lawful.
8.          Per contra, Mr.Sahu, learned Advocate for the
respondent submitted that the learned appellate court, on a
threadbare analysis of evidence on record and pleadings,
allowed the appeal. There is no perversity in the finding of the
learned appellate court. Provision of Section 100 C.P.C. is clear
and unambiguously stipulates that the judgment passed by the
courts below cannot be interfered with on the ground that the
same vitiates with erroneous finding of fact. Where the
judgment rendered by the appellate court is based upon
appreciation of relevant evidence, the Second Appeal cannot be
entertained, unless the same is perverse. The learned appellate

                                 6
court, on appreciation of evidence, came to hold that there was
a partition among defendant no.3 and co-sharers. The suit land
fell in favour of defendant no.3. Had the land not been allotted
to defendant no.3, he could not have executed Ext.1. Further,
the mortgaged deed vide Ext.E relied upon by the defendants
shows that there was partition between the co-sharers of
defendant no.3. The execution of Ext.1 having been admitted by
defendant nos.1 and 2, it is not open for them to say that no
such document was at all executed. When the contents of Ext.1
are taken into consideration, it is evident that the suit land was
in exclusive possession of defendant nos. 1 and 2. The same
was allotted in their favour in partition. They were paying land
revenue to the State. The recitals are binding. With regard to
allegation of interpolation of the description of the disputed
land, the learned appellate court came to hold that the stamp
papers were purchased by defendant no.1 according to the
endorsement made by the stamp vendor on the reverse of
stamp paper. At the instance of the defendants alone the deed
was executed and some interpolations and scorings appear
while giving the boundaries of the land in different ink. The
schedule of land does not appear to have been materially
interpolated. Therefore the contract, itself for these do not
appear suspicious. The deed cannot be said to be forged. He
further submitted that the plaintiff was/is ready and willing to
perform the part of contract. Since the defendants failed to
execute the same, he instituted the suit. He further submitted
that the learned appellate court negatived the contention of the

                                 7
defendants with regard to continuous willingness on the ground
that no evidence has been adduced by the defendants that
breach of contract had been adequately compensated by means
of money.
9.         This is a suit for specific performance of contract.
The assertions of the plaintiff are that he is ready and willing to
perform his part contract. The plaintiff has to plead and prove
the readiness and willingness before he succeeded. This is a
condition precedent. Admittedly, no notice along with a draft
sale deed was sent before institution of the suit. On this
ground, the suit will fail.
10.        In Baruna Giri and others Vrs. Rajakishore Giri and
others, AIR 1983 Orissa 107, a Division Bench of this Court
held :
           “14. No doubt the entire consideration had been
           paid, but the next step in the performance of the
           contract was the execution of the sale deed. It was
           the duty of the defendants to propose a proper draft
           of the sale deed and submit it to the plaintiff as
           contemplated under Section 55(1)(d) of the T.P.Act.
           Under the provisions of Section 29 of the Stamp Act
           the expenses for the sale-deed were to be borne by
           the purchaser. Until the defendants paid the money
           for the stamp duty, the sale-deed could not be
           executed. By virtue of the combined effect of Section
           55(1)(d), T.P.Act and Section 29(c), Stamp Act it was
           the duty of the defendants to propose a draft of the
           sale deed and to express their readiness and
           willingness to pay the money and to call upon the
           plaintiffs to execute the sale-deed - See ILR (1975)
           Cut 993 at page 998, Bhimasen Mohapatra v.

                                   8
             Bhabani Mahapatrani. In para 14 of the written
             statement it was stated as follows:--
                   "...... But as the executants of the agreement
             for sale were residing in the District of Singhbhum
             and as all of them were not available at a time the
             registered sale deed could not be executed by them
             and as the land remained in possession of
             Chandramohan and the members of his family no
             required steps were taken for a registered sale
             deed.............."
                   This shows that instead of complying with the
             requirements of Section 55(1)(d) of the T.P. Act and
             Section 29(c) of the Stamp Act, the defendants
             remained contented with possession of the land. Had
             it really been a fact that the defendants were ready
             and willing to perform their part of the contract,
             instead of sitting quiet for such a long time they
             would have sent a written notice calling upon the
             plaintiffs to execute the sale deed. Their failure to
             send such a notice shows that they were not ready
             and willing to perform their part of the contract. We
             accordingly hold that the defendants are not entitled
             to the benefit of Section 53-A, T. P. Act.”
                                                     (emphasis laid)
11.          The ratio in the case of Baruna Giri (supra) applies
with full force to the facts of this case.
12.          In Sardar Singh Vrs. Krishna Devi (Smt.) and
another, (1994) 4 SCC 18, the apex Court held that the court
has to see the totality of the circumstances, conduct of the
parties and respective interests under the contract while
granting/refusing such reliefs.

                                  9
13.         In the agreement to sell, Ext-1, there are several
interpolations and overwriting in the boundary and description
of the land. In view of the same, it is not appropriate to grant
the discretionary relief of specific performance of contract to the
plaintiff.
14.         The defendants have admitted that they have taken
an amount of Rs.1400/- from the plaintiff. They have also sent
a notice to return back the money. In view of the same, the
defendants are liable to pay a sum of Rs.1400/- with interest at
the rate of 9% per annum.
15.         In the result, the judgment and decree of the learned
appellate court is set aside and the appeal is allowed. The
defendants     shall  refund    Rs.1,400/-(One    thousand     four
hundred) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of the
agreement. Both the parties shall bear their respective costs.
                                            ……..…………………..
                                              Dr.A.K.Rath, J.
