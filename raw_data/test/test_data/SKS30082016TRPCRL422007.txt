S. K. Sahoo, J.       Heard Mr. Somadarsan Mohanty, learned counsel for
         the petitioners and Mr. Niranjan Moharana, learned Addl.
         Standing Counsel for the Vigilance Department. Learned counsel
         for the petitioners submitted at the outset that the petitioner
         no.2 Upendranath Giri is dead. In view of such submission, the
         TRPCRL application so far as the petitioner no.2 is concerned,
         stands disposed of as infructuous.

                                 2
2.          This is an application under section 407 of Cr.P.C.
filed by the petitioners for quashing the order dated 30.07.2007
of the learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur passed in
G.R. Case No. 3 (V) of 1992 in transferring the case to the Court
of learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore with a further prayer
that the case be heard and disposed of by the learned Special
Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur.
            The relevant portion of the impugned order dated
30.07.2007 reads as follows:-
            “Later – As per the direction of the Hon’ble
            High Court, the case record is transferred to
            the Court of Special Judge (V), Jeypore for
            disposal according to law. Put up on the date
            fixed.”
3.          On the basis of the First Information Report lodged
by the Inspector of Police, Vigilance, Nawarangpur dated
11.01.1992, the case was instituted under section 13(2) read
with section 13(1)(c) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
(hereafter “1988 Act”) and sections 409/472/477-A/34 of the
Indian Penal Code and after completion of investigation, charge
sheet was submitted against the petitioners and proforma
opposite   parties   and   after framing  of  charges,   the  trial
commenced in the Court of learned Special Judge, Vigilance,

                                 3
Berhampur in G.R. Case No. 3 (V) of 1992. Out of the 42 charge
sheeted    witnesses,   four  witnesses    were    examined      and
thereafter, by virtue of the impugned order dated 30.07.2007,
as per the direction of this Court, the case record was
transferred   from   the   Court   of Special    Judge,   Vigilance,
Berhampur to the Court of Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore for
disposal in accordance with law.
4.           Learned counsel for the petitioners while challenging
the   impugned    order   contended   that   the   petitioner   no.1
Sudhanshu Shekhar Mishra is serving at Angul which is at a
distance of 592 kms. away from Jeypore and the petitioner no.3
Dhirendra Kumar Choudhury has retired from the Government
service w.e.f. 31.10.2006 and he is now staying in his native
village Trutiapada under Bolagarh Police Station in the district of
Khurda and the distance of Bolagarh to Jeypore is 562 kms. and
therefore, it would be extremely difficult on the part of the
petitioners nos.1 and 3 to attend the proceeding at Jeypore and
therefore, when the trial had already commenced at Berhampur,
there was no justification for transferring the case to the Court
of Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore and accordingly, for the
convenience of the parties, necessary order may be passed that
the case should continue to be tried before the learned Special

                                 4
Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur. He relied upon the ratio laid down
in the case of Sanjeeb Kumar Sahu –Vrs.- State of Odisha
reported in 2014 (Vol. 1) Orissa Law Reviews 891 wherein
it is held that convenience of the parties including the witnesses
to be produced at the trial is also a relevant consideration for
deciding the transfer petition. The convenience of the parties
does not necessarily mean the convenience of the petitioner
alone who approached the Court on misconceived notions of
apprehension. Convenience for the purpose of transfer means
the convenience of the prosecution, other accused, the witnesses
and the larger interest of the society. Learned counsel for the
petitioners further submitted that the case has been transferred
on the administrative side on the establishment of the Court at
Jeypore and since the petitioners were likely to be affected by
such order, they should have been heard before the order of
transfer was passed particularly when trial of the case had
already commenced. He relied upon the decisions of this Court in
cases of Satyananda Pani -Vrs.- State of Orissa reported in
(2000) 18 Orissa Criminal Reports 26 and Surendra Kumar
Purohit -Vrs.- State of Orissa reported in 2012 (Vol. 2)
Orissa Law Reviews 103.

                                  5
5.           Learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the Vigilance
Department vehemently opposed the prayer made by the
petitioners and submitted that after the establishment of Court
of Special Judge, Vigilance at Jeypore, all the cases which were
pending in the Court of the Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur
but coming within the jurisdiction of the learned Special Judge,
Vigilance, Jeypore were transferred to Jeypore as per the
direction of the Hon’ble High Court as in that position, Court of
the   Special   Judge,   Vigilance, Berhampur     lacks  territorial
jurisdiction to try the case and therefore, the contentions raised
by the learned counsel for the petitioners are not acceptable in
the eye of law. He further contended that out of the 42 charge
sheet witnesses, though four witnesses were examined in the
Court of learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur till the
transfer of the case but the rest of the witnesses are not only
from Berhampur but also from Nawarangpur, Papadahandi and
Kalahandi which are closer to Jeypore and as such, there will be
no inconvenience for the witnesses to attend the Court at
Jeypore and therefore, there is no merit in the application and
accordingly, the same should be dismissed.
             Learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the Vigilance
Department placed strong reliance in the case of Bhiaru Ram

                                  6
-Vrs.- Central Bureau of Investigation reported in (2010)
47 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 286 wherein it is held as
follows:-
            “9.    A perusal of the charge sheet containing
            all these details clearly shows that witnesses to
            be examined are not only from Jaipur,
            Rajasthan, but also from various other places
            including Mumbai. Though the petitioners may
            have a little inconvenience, the mere
            inconvenience may not be sufficient ground for
            the exercise of power of transfer but it must be
            shown that the trial in the chosen forum will
            result in failure of justice. We have already
            pointed out that except the plea of
            inconvenience on the ground that they have to
            come all the way from Rajasthan, no other
            reason was pressed into service. Even, the
            request for transfer to Delhi cannot be
            accepted since it would not be beneficial either
            to the petitioners or to the prosecution. In fact,
            the main accused, respondent nos. 3 & 4 have
            not filed any petition seeking transfer. In such
            circumstances, the plea of the petitioners for
            transfer of the case from the Court of Special
            Judge, CBI, Greater Mumbai to Special Judge,
            CBI, Jaipur on the ground of inconvenience
            cannot be accepted.”
            He further placed reliance in the case of Kamlesh
Kumar     -Vrs.-   State   of   Jharkhand     reported    in   2014
Criminal Law Journal 22 wherein it is held as follows:-
            “44. In the context of Article 227 of the
            Constitution, this Court observed in paragraph

                      7
12 of Ranbir Yadav –Vrs.- State of Bihar,
(1995) 4 Supreme Court Cases 392 that
the High Court has superintendence over all
courts and tribunals throughout the territories
in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction and
that in its plenary administrative power, the
High Court could transfer a case from one
Court to another. It was further held that so
long    as    the   power    is   exercised     for
administrative exigency, without impinging
upon or prejudicially affecting the rights and
interests of the parties to any judicial
proceeding, there is no reason to hold that
administrative powers must yield to judicial
powers simply because in a given circumstance
they coexist.
45. In the present case, the High Court could
have exercised its judicial power of transfer
under Section 407 of the Code (if called upon
to do so) and it could also have exercised its
administrative power of transfer under Article
227 of the Constitution, which it did, as is
evident from the letter dated 6th May 2002
issued by the Registrar General of the High
Court of Jharkhand to the Secretary to the
Government,       Law     (Judl.)    Department,
Government of Jharkhand. The fact that for an
administrative exigency, the High Court
decided to exercise its plenary administrative
power does not per se lead to the conclusion
that the transfer of the case from the
Magistrate to the Special Judge was unlawful.
The legality of the action cannot be called in
question in this case since no prejudice has
been caused to the petitioners by such a
transfer.”

                                    8
6.           Power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India
can be exercised suo motu by the High Court as custodian of all
justice within the limits of its territorial jurisdiction and for the
vindication of its position as such. The power of superintendence
conferred on the High Court by Article 227 is administrative as
well as judicial and it is wider than the one conferred on the High
Court    by   Article    226  in  the  sense   that    the  power   of
superintendence       is  not  subject  to  those    technicalities of
procedure or traditional fetters which are to be found in
certiorari jurisdiction. The powers under Article 227 are wide and
can be used to meet the ends of justice. No restrictions are
indicated in the exercise of power under Article 227, and
restrictions, if any, are self-imposed. The emphasis of Article 227
is on administrative control, and the judicial power is merely
ancillary to the administrative control.
7.           Considering the rival submissions made by the
learned counsels for the respective parties, it is seen that out of
two grounds taken by the learned counsel for the petitioners, the
first ground is that the case should not have been transferred to
the Court of learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore from the
Court of learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur as it would
cause inconvenience to the petitioners to attend the Court at

                                   9
Jeypore and the second ground is that without hearing the
petitioners, even on administrative grounds, the case should not
have been transferred when the trial had already commenced.
8.           Coming to the second ground first, section 4(2) of
the 1988 Act stipulates that every offence specified in sub-
section (1) of section 3 shall be tried by the Special Judge for the
area within which it was committed, or, as the case may be, by
the Special Judge appointed for the case, or, where there are
more Special Judges than one for such area, by such one of
them as may be specified in this behalf by the Central
Government.
             In this case, there is no dispute that the offence was
committed within the present jurisdiction of the learned Special
Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore. It is also not disputed that when the
F.I.R. was lodged, charge sheet was submitted, cognizance of
offences was taken and the trial commenced, there was no
competent Court at Jeypore vested with jurisdiction to deal with
such matters and therefore, all such types of cases were being
tried by the learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur. Once
the Special Court, Vigilance, Jeypore was established, the
learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur lost its jurisdiction
to try the case as on the general principle, the Court at

                                   10
Berhampur does not ordinarily have extra territorial jurisdiction.
Once a Special Judge was appointed at Jeypore, the cases from
the Court of Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur are required to
be transferred to the said Court of competent jurisdiction
otherwise the very purpose of establishment of such Court at
Jeypore and appointment of a Special Judge will get frustrated.
The legislature has enacted the 1988 Act and provided for
speedy trial of offences punishable under the said Act in the
public interest. Considering the object and scheme of the Act
and in the public interest, when the High Court decided to
exercise its plenary administrative power after establishment of
the Court of Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore to transfer the
case from Berhampur to Jeypore without impinging upon or
prejudicially affecting the rights and interests of the parties, I am
of the view that it cannot be said that the impugned order
passed on the direction of the High Court suffers from any
illegality or infirmity rather the same would advance the cause of
justice. Two of the co-accused persons who have been made as
proforma opposite parties in this application have not challenged
the order of transfer and therefore, it is presumed that they
have no grievance. There is nothing on the record to suggest
that the petitioners will not get fair trial and may face

                                 11
miscarriage of justice. The ratio of the two decisions of this Court
in Satyananda Pani’s case (supra) and Surendra Kumar
Purohit’s case (supra) does not hold good in view of the ratio
laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Kamlesh
Kumar (supra). I am also of the view that when this Court was
suo motu exercising its plenary administrative power and on the
ground of territorial jurisdiction directing transfers of the case
without impinging upon or prejudicially affecting the rights and
interests of the parties, there was no requirement to hear the
petitioners before exercise of such power.
             Therefore, even if the examination of the witnesses
had already started, the learned Special Judge, Vigilance,
Berhampur was quite justified in transferring the case to the
Court of learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore in pursuance
of the direction of the High Court. Therefore, the contention
raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners that without
hearing   the   petitioners, the   case   should  not   have   been
transferred even on administrative side is not acceptable and
hence stands rejected.
9.           Coming to the first ground regarding inconvenience
of parties is concerned, no doubt as per the averments made in
this application, the service place of petitioner no.1 is at Angul

                                    12
and petitioner no.3 is staying within the jurisdiction of Bolagarh
Police Station in the district of Khurda but in my humble view,
that cannot be a ground to retransfer the case from the Court of
learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Jeypore to the Court of learned
Special Judge, Vigilance, Berhampur. As rightly pointed out by
the   learned     Addl.   Standing     Counsel   for  the    Vigilance
Department, the rest of the witnesses are not only from
Berhampur      but also    from Nawarangpur, Papadahandi and
Kalahandi and therefore, it will not be inconvenient for them to
attend the Court at Jeypore.
             Though the section 407 of Cr.P.C. empowers the
High   Court    to  transfer   a   case   from  one  criminal    Court
subordinate to its authority to any other such criminal Court of
equal   or   superior   jurisdiction   on   the ground    of  general
convenience of the parties or witnesses or when it is felt
expedient for the ends of justice, it cannot be said that this
Court is required to take note of only the place of abode or the
service place of the accused while making transfer of the cases
in exercise its plenary administrative power. The petitioners may
have a little inconvenience in attending the Court at Jeypore but
the main criteria should be trial of a case in a Court within whose
jurisdiction the offence was committed. The place of service as

                                    13
well as the place of abode of the parties may change from time
to time but that cannot be a factor which would outweigh the
jurisdictional point consideration in a criminal trial.
               The petitioners who are on bail can file appropriate
application under section 317 of Cr.P.C. through their advocates
before the learned Trial Court at Jeypore which shall be duly
considered and their personal appearance can only be insisted
upon by the learned Trial Court as and when it would be
necessary. The petitioners shall give an undertaking before the
Trial Court that they shall not claim any prejudice in case the
evidence of the witnesses are taken up in their absence but in
presence of their counsel. Therefore, the contention raised by
the learned counsel for the petitioners that on the ground of
inconvenience to the petitioners, the transfer order is illegal, is
not acceptable and hence stands rejected.
                In view of the aforesaid discussion, I am not inclined
to accept the prayer made by the petitioners and accordingly,
the TRPCRL application stands dismissed.
                                                      …………………………
