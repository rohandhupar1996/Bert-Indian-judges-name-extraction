                      THE HONOURABLE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. V.GOPALA GOWDA
                                                    AND
                                 THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K.MISHRA
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Date of hearing – 25.04.2012                        :              Date of judgment - 25.04.2012
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                      2
S.K.Mishra, J.           In these writ petitions, the petitioners pray to direct the State
          Government for framing of guidelines to deal with the cases of witch-hunting and to
          protect women from such hunting till legislation is framed in this regard.
          2.             The petitioners in their applications have described the instances of
          murders on the allegations that the deceased was practicing witchcraft. The
          petitioners have pleaded about several such incidents in the State of Orissa. It is
          further pleaded that the persons committing the murder do so under the influence of
          ‘Gunias’. As such, it is pleaded that the propagators of the crime are generally not in
          a fit state of mind while committing the crime. The person often believes that he is
          doing the right thing while committing murder of a person, who is alleged to be
          practicing witchcraft. Such state of affairs is prevalent in all the tribal districts of the
          State.
          3.             The petitioner pleaded that India is a signatory to the universal
          declaration of human rights to give protection to women from discrimination and all
          sorts of violence against them. Besides, the United Nations’ International Covenant
          on Civil and Political Rights prescribe that all persons are equal before law and
          entitled to equal protection of law. Government of India is a signatory to the same in
          the year 1966. The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination
          against Women (CEDAW) resolved that the countries which have ratified the same
          should take appropriate steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women.
          Article 5(a) of CEDAW further provides that the State shall take appropriate
          measures to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women.
          Witch-hunting, which is prevalent in several States, leads to dispossession, torture
          and murder but as of date, although India is a signatory to CEDAW, no steps have
          been taken to enact appropriate law to curb the menace of witch-hunting, which is

                                               3
prevalent in this State. States like Bihar, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh have already
taken steps to eradicate such practices but our State has not taken any steps with
regard to eradicating such practice. Therefore, the petitioner prays that appropriate
direction be given to the State to enact law in this regard.
4.             The petitioners rely on the reported case of Bishaka and others v.
State of Rajasthan and others reported in AIR 1997 SC 3011, wherein the
Supreme Court has taken into consideration the provisions of the CEDAW and has
held as follows:
               “16. In view of the above, and the absence of enacted law to
               provide for the effective enforcement of the basic human right
               of gender equality and guarantee against sexual harassment
               and abuse, more particularly against sexual harassment at
               work places, we lay down the guidelines and norms specified
               hereinafter for due observance at all work places or other
               institutions, until a legislation is enacted for the purpose. This is
               done in exercise of the power available under Article 32 of the
               Constitution for enforcement of the fundamental rights and it is
               further emphasized that this would be treated as the law
               declared by this Court under Article 141 of the Constitution.”
                 It is, therefore, urged that in view of the fact that there is no legislation
to tackle the problem of witch-hunting, this Court should give direction to the State
Government to introduce appropriate law before the Legislature and in the
interregnum provide guidelines to prevent witch-hunting in the State of Orissa.
5.             It is seen that the Legislature of Bihar has passed the Prevention of
Witch (Daain) Practice Act, 1999 (Bihar Act 9 of 1999). Similar Act has also been
passed by the Legislature of Chhatishgarh.
6.             Witch-hunting is also seen in the State of Karnataka and a Committee
consisting of eminent Professors was asked to investigate and report about the
practice of Banamathi. Banamathi is the Kannada word for witch. The Committee
after careful and detailed investigation of a large number of cases and on the basis of

                                             4
discussions with number of persons, who were considered to have knowledge on the
subject, came to the following conclusions:
             “People have been suffering from this so called witchcraft i.e.
          Banamathi due to various causes. Some of the prominent causes
          have been fear, ignorance, superstition, personal and family
          problems, poverty, religious feuds, and village politics. This
          phenomenon of Banamathi is more prevalent in remote villages
          cut away from the main stream of life. It is also a fact that most of
          the victims are women. Even among women those belongs to
          marriageable and child-bearing age groups seem to be more
          prone to this problem.
              All the sufferings of the victims attributed to Banamathi fit into
          familiar patterns of mental and physical diseases. Most of these
          are psychiatric cases. Many of these attacks were induced by a
          simple suggestion by the doctors and were also terminated by a
          similar suggestion. These people have been suffering from a
          variety of psychological disorders. Hysterical neurosis, a form of
          psychiatric disturbance, is the most common. This is
          characterized by episodes of abnormal behaviour, like
          screaming, developing fits, becoming unconscious, tearing away
          of clothes, inability to speak and so on. Theses are directly
          understandable in terms of strong socio-cultural beliefs, family
          and personal problems, poverty etc. It is common knowledge that
          such internal conflicts resulting in hysterical neurosis are found in
          other countries also. Their effects would be in accordance with
          the prevailing social and other conditions. In a few villages these
          psychological disturbances have assumed the form of ‘mass
          hysteria’ as witnessed in Yadlapur and in Benekanahalli villages.
          There are other kinds of neuroses like depression, obsession etc.
          from which some of the victims have been suffering.
              The phenomenon of Banamathi as already mentioned has
          been in existence for decades and is deep rooted among some
          sections of the people in North Karnataka which formed part of
          the erstwhile Hyderabad State governed by the Nizam. This
          malady exists in some parts of the present Andhra Pradesh
          adjacent to Gulbarga and Bidar Districts also. The belief has
          been handed over from person to person and passed on from
          generation to generation. In fact, the belief in Banamathi is so
          deep rooted that even common physical ailments such as
          asthma, leprosy, tuberculosis, anaemia, and vitamin deficiency
          diseases are attributed to Banamathi. Susceptible and ignorant
          people have become so sensitive and scared that they think of
          suffering from the effects of Banamathi whenever they are not
          feeling well. The fact that even normal variations in the yield of

                                   5
milk of a cow is also attributed to Banamathi shows to what
extent the pernicious belief is deep seated in their minds.
         The second category of the phenomena belongs to the
appearance and disappearance of the objects, falling of stones,
burning of sarees etc. It is very significant to note that nobody
had ever witnessed those phenomena during the process of their
actual occurrence. No body saw either the clothes catching fire or
scares during the process of their marking. As already mentioned
two persons were caught by the villagers when they were trying
to throw stones. Besides, falling of stones is reported in many
parts of the State and it is also interesting to note that according
to such reports there was no falling of stones when a vigil was
kept. A careful scrutiny of these phenomena will lead to the
conclusion that there is no evidence of the working of any
supernatural force. Many of the phenomena attributed to
Banamathi must have been deliberately performed by persons
due to various reasons such as to attract attention, to get
sympathy, or to avoid extra work. These are all of common
occurrence familiar to the doctors in the field of psychology and
psychiatry. It may not be out of place to mention that nobody ever
came forward to perform ‘Banamathi’ on the members of the
team when they publicly offered themselves as subjects on many
an occasion.
      Thus, based on a careful analysis of all the available data
and a close and searching examination of a large number of
victims, the Investigation Committee has come to the unanimous
and firm conclusion that the so called Banamathi is not due to
any supernatural cause.
     It is a fact that there has been a lot of suffering on account of
these mental and physical problems. It is also a fact that vested
interests have been using Banamathi as a means of exploitation.
Attributing these phenomena to supernatural causes they have
been reaping a rich harvest. Some of the families are ruined on
account of spending large amounts of money in the hope of
getting a cure of the ill-effects. Poor villagers and gullible people
are being cheated.
          The Committee would like to point out certain strong
supporting factors which have lent credence to belief in
Banamathi. The fact that many educated people, officials and
men of public importance implicitly believing in Banamathi has
also been responsible for its continued widespread belief among
large sections of villagers. As we know superstitions are widely
prevalent in our country. All of us know that an educated
superstitious person is more harmful to society than his
uneducated counterpart. Besides, occasional, nay, frequent
dubious and unscientific reports, articles, and statements in some

                                             6
           newspapers tend to give a final seal of confirmation to the
           existence of some kind of witchcraft. In fact the phenomena
           attributed to Banamathi are not peculiar to places in Gulbarga or
           Bidar Districts. They are widespread in all parts of the state and
           the country. But they are called by different names. All these can
           be attributed to the same root causes excluding any supernatural
           force.
                 Another important reason for the spread of Banamathi is that
           the Police Department under its existing laws are helpless and
           cannot take notice of cases coming under the purview of
           Banamathi. This has indirectly given a free hand and also
           encouragement to persons who in the name of Banamathi scare
           innocent people and exploit them.”              (Emphasis supplied)
7.             Thus, it is clear that this social malady is prevalent because of the
ignorance of the people and an effective measure to control the same is necessary to
be taken. The Committee of Elimination of Discrimination Against Women of the
United Nations in the 51st Session held between 13th February to 2nd March, 2012 has
given its concluding observations on the elimination of discrimination against women.
The Committee also recommended to eliminate stereo-type and harmful practice. At
paragraphs 21 and 22, the Committee observed as follows:
           “21. The Committee recognizes the rich culture and traditions of
           the State party and their importance in daily life. However, the
           Committee expresses its serious concern about the persistence
           of harmful norms, practices and traditions, patriarchal attitudes
           and deep-rooted stereotypes, regarding the roles, responsibilities
           and identities of women and men in all spheres of life, as well as
           the State party’s limited efforts to address such discriminatory
           practices. These include, in particular, polygamy, bride price
           (lobola), and in certain regions, virginity testing and witch hunting.
           The Committee is concerned that such customs and practices
           perpetuate discrimination against women and girls and that they
           are reflected in women’s disadvantageous and unequal status in
           many areas, including education, public life, decision-making and
           in the persistence of violence against women, and that, thus far
           the State party ahs not take sustained measures to modify or
           eliminate stereotypes and harmful practices.
           22.    The Committee urges the State party to :
              (a)  Put in place, without delay, a comprehensive strategy to
                   modify or eliminate patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes

                                            7
                   that discriminate women in conformity with the provisions
                   of the Convention. Such measures should include efforts,
                   in collaboration with civil society and community and
                   religious leaders to educate and raise awareness of this
                   subject, targeting women and men at all levels of the
                   society;
              (b) More vigorously address harmful practice by expanding
                   public education programmes and by effectively enforcing
                   the prohibition of such practices, in particular, in rural
                   areas;
              (c)  Use innovative measures that target media people to
                   strengthen understanding of the equality of women and
                   men and through the educational system to enhance a
                   positive and non-stereotypical portrayal of women; and
              (d) Monitor and review the measures taken in order to assess
                   their impact and to take appropriate action.”
8.             From the above, it is clear that the CEDAW also endorse witch-
hunting as one of the harmful practices. The State should formulate a preventive
strategy to eliminate such practice. This Court, therefore, is of the opinion that the
State should introduce a bill in the Legislature to enact law to tackle the menace of
witch-hunting effectively. There should be concerted efforts to spread awareness to
eradicate the superstitions among the people. In the meantime, we recommend the
guidelines in following paragraphs for prevention of witch-hunting in the State of
Orissa. It shall be the duty of the State and the District Administration to prevent or
deter commission of witch-hunting and to provide protection to citizens from being
victim of witch-hunting. The State shall also provide procedure for prosecution of the
persons who endangers human life on the allegation that she is a witch.
9.             For the aforesaid purpose, witch-hunting means and includes:
    (i)    Any person accuses another or defames a woman by calling her ‘Dayan’
           or ‘Dahani’ or any other name or symbol suggesting her to be a witch;
           and

                                             8
    (ii)   Any person/persons jointly or individually harms another person either
           physically or mentally or damages her property calling her to be a witch,
           shall be known to be practicing witch-hunting;
10.                 Whoever forces a woman to drink or eat inedible or obnoxious
substances on the allegation that she is a witch, shall be punishable under the
provisions of the Indian Penal Code or any special law attracted to such
commission of offence.
11.               Any person calling another a ‘witch’ or being possessed one, uses
criminal force against her, or instigates or provokes others in doing so or abate with
intent to harm and/or to displace her from the house by using criminal force or
intimidates, which amounts to specific offence under the Indian Penal Code or any
other law, the authorities shall initiate appropriate action in accordance with the law
by lodging complaint in the Police Station.
12.             The authorities also prevent any person from acting as a ‘tantric’ or a
‘witch doctor’ in the area claiming to have possessed spiritual and magical powers
to cure witch-craft or in possession of super-natural powers and performs any rituals
to free the woman from the evil spirit or entices a woman or any person or her
behalf with a promise to bless the woman with a child or performs any ritual on
behalf of any person with an intention to harm the woman, should be prosecuted, if
such an act amounts to any specific offence under the Indian Penal Code or any
other law.
13.           Preventive steps.
             In the meantime, the authorities shall take appropriate steps to prevent
witch-hunting and in particular take the following steps :

                                                    9
        (i)     Public awareness programmes should be launched in the Grama
                Panchayats to eradicate the superstitions of witch-craft;
        (ii)    Health camps should be organized in different village level to detect
                cases of the psychologically disordered, which may lead to a false
                acquisition being possessed or being a witch;
        (iii)   The Investigating Agency in cases involving allegations of witch-hunting,
                in order to avoid the witnesses turning hostile should take steps to get
                statement of the witnesses recorded under Section 164 of the Code of
                Criminal Procedure, 1973.
     14.          These directions are not exhaustive. The State may, in addition to such
     steps, take suitable and appropriate step to tackle the menace of witch-hunting.
                   Accordingly, we direct that the guidelines should be strictly observed by
     the authorities till a suitable legislation is passed by the State Legislature. The State
     Government shall introduce an appropriate bill in the State Legislature within a
     period of one year.
                    The writ application is accordingly disposed of.
                                                                ………………………….
                                                                     S.K.Mishra, J.
V.Gopala Gowda, C.J.              I agree.
                                                                 ………………………….
                                                                   V.Gopala Gowda, C.J.
