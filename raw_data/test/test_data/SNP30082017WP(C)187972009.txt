                           Date of hearing and judgment: 30.08.2017
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. N. Prasad, J.           The petitioner has approached this court under Article 226 and
            227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the order dtd.14.5.2008 passed
            by the General Manager (Network-I) and Disciplinary Authority whereby and
            where under in terms of provision of Rule 67(j) of SBIOSR, 1992, the
            petitioner has been inflicted with the punishment of dismissal from service
            and the period of suspension will be held as such, i.e. not on duty and the
            order dtd.17.9.2008 passed by the Chief General Manager and Appellate
            Authority whereby and where under the appeal has been dismissed.

                                      2
2.            The case of the petitioner is that he was working as officer Junior
Management Grade Scale-I and during his incumbency as Asst. Manger
(Advances) at Buxi Bazar Branch, has been departmentally proceeded for an
allegation of irregularities and fraudulent withdrawal of rupees to the tune of
Rs.25.92 lakhs from his two overdraft accounts bearing Nos.10546443595
and 10546443607, as such he has been held not fit to be an officer and the
same is prejudicial to the interest of the Bank since he has failed to discharge
his duty with utmost integrity, honesty, devotion and diligence which
contravene the provision of Rule, 50(4) of the State Bank of India Officers
Service Rules, 1992 governing his service in the Bank.
              The petitioner has participated in the departmental inquiry
wherein he has admitted his guilt and shown the reason of doing the
irregularities as also deposited the said amount in the bank but the inquiry
officer has found the charges leveled against him as proved which has been
accepted by the disciplinary authority and after following due procedure as
provided under the Rule, has inflicted upon him the punishment of dismissal
from service as also not to treat the period of suspension on duty. The
petitioner has approached the appellate authority and the appellate authority,
while rejecting the appeal, has confirmed the order passed by the disciplinary
authority.
3.            The case of the petitioner is that along with the departmental
proceeding a G.R. case was also instituted against him U/s.409 of the Indian
Penal Code ( in short ‘IPC’) for committing criminal breach of trust, U/s.420 of

                                      3
the IPC for committing cheating and U/s.13(1)(c) of Prevention of Corruption
Act        for       committing       dishonest misappropriation of amount to
the tune of Rs.26 lakhs approximately from the State bank of India and
U/s.13(1)(d of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with section 13(2) of the
said Act in which the petitioner has been acquitted by the trial court vide
judgment pronounced in this regard on 21.12.2012 in TR case No.31 of 2007
arising out of RC case No.23-A of 2006.
4.             Learned Sr. Counsel representing the petitioner has submitted
that after acquittal in the criminal case which is based upon the same set of
facts and evidence, hence the order of dismissal needs interference by this
court on the principle that if the criminal case and the departmental
proceeding are based upon same set of facts and evidence, the outcome of the
criminal case will govern the departmental proceeding.
               He submits by putting reliance upon the judgment rendered by
the trial court in the criminal case that the evidence led by the prosecution,
i.e. P.W.7, P.W.10 and P.W.13 who have not supported the case of the
prosecution, as such the petitioner has been acquitted from the criminal
charges which is the honourable acquittal, as such continuance of the
petitioner under the order of dismissal is illegal and the dismissal order needs
review by this court.
               In support of his argument he relied upon the judgment rendered
by Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of M. Paul Anthony Vrs. Bharat Gold

                                      4
Mines Ltd. and Another, reported in (1999) 3 SCC 679, G.M. Tank Vrs.
State of Gujarat and Others, reported in (2006) 5 SCC 446 and S.
Bhaskar Reddy and Another Vrs. Superintendent of Police and Another,
reported in (2015) 2 SCC 365 wherein, according to the learned Senior
Counsel, on the similar facts and circumstances basis of the judgment of
acquittal passed by the trial court, the order of reinstatement has been
passed against the delinquent employees. Since the fact of the case in hand is
exactly similar, the petitioner deserves to get the same relief.
5.             Per Contra learned counsel for Opposite Party - Bank has
vehemently opposed the prayer of the petitioner, while arguing, he submits
that it is a case wherein the petitioner has admitted his guilt. He submits that
the petitioner has mis-utilized his official position by taking out rupees 26
lakhs from the bank which is the public money, as such the same is gross
irregularity.
               He further submits that the petitioner being a banker is
supposed to act with utmost sincerity and honesty and it is settled that the
bankers are treated to be a separate class of public servant in comparison to
the public servant working under the other establishment since the bankers
are dealing with the public money.
               He submits that the petitioner has been allowed to participate in
the enquiry by providing all opportunity of hearing wherein the disciplinary
authority, after accepting the enquiry report, has inflicted him with the

                                      5
punishment of dismissal from service which has been affirmed by the
appellate authority.
              So far as the contention of recalling the order of dismissal on the
ground of his acquittal in the criminal case, he submits that the judgment
rendered by the trial court is not an honourable acquittal rather the acquittal
is purely technical. By referring to the content of the judgment he submitted
that the judgment of acquittal has been passed mainly on the ground that
since the amount has been recovered from the accused and there is delay in
instituting the FIR, but that does not mean that the part of irregularity which
has been committed by him will be said to be rectified.
              He relied upon the judgments rendered by Hon’ble Apex Court in
the cases of Avinash Sadashiv Bhosale (dead) through LRs. Vrs. Union of
India and Others, reported in (2012) 13 SCC 142, Deputy Inspector
General of Police and Another Vrs. S. Samuthiram, reported in (2013) 1
SCC 598, Commissioner of Police, New Delhi and Another Vrs. Meher
Singh, reported in (2013) 7 SCC 685, General Manager (Operations) State
Bank of India and Another Vrs. R. Periyasamy, reported in (2015) 3 SCC
101 and Union of India and Another Vrs. Purushottam, reported in (2015)
3 SCC 779.
6.            Heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the
documents available on record.

                                      6
              The fact which is not in dispute in this case is that the petitioner
has been proceeded departmentally for an allegation of commission of
irregularities while working as officer in Junior Management Grade-I under
opposite party – bank wherein he has fraudulently withdrawn Rs.25.92 lakhs
from two over draft accounts in core banking system, as such this action has
been considered to be failing in discharging his duties with utmost integrity,
honest, devotion and diligence and thereby contravene the Rule 50(4) of the
SBI Officers Service Rules, 1992 governing his service in the bank. The
petitioner has admitted his guilt by saying that it is due to urgent need of
money this has been done which amount has subsequently been deposited in
the bank account. The inquiry officer, on the admission of the allegation by
the petitioner, supported by relevant documents, has found the charge
proved. The disciplinary authority, after appreciating the finding of the
enquiry report, has issued second show cause notice along with copy of the
inquiry report asking the petitioner to submit response and thereafter the
petitioner has been inflicted with the punishment of dismissal by the
disciplinary authority vide order passed in this regard on 14th May, 2008
which has been assailed by the petitioner before the appellate authority who
has also affirmed the view of the disciplinary / appointing authority.
              The order passed by the appellate authority is dtd.17.9.2008.
The petitioner has assailed the order of the disciplinary authority by filing this
writ petition on the ground of his acquittal in the criminal case since for the
same set of charges and evidence a separate criminal case has been instituted

                                      7
in which the petitioner has been acquitted by the judgment pronounced in
this regard by the trial court on 21.12.2012.
              The sole contention of the learned Sr. Counsel representing the
petitioner that since the criminal case is based upon the same set of facts,
allegations and evidence for which disciplinary proceeding has been initiated
and since he has been acquitted by the competent court of criminal
jurisdiction in the criminal case, as such the order of dismissal needs to be
reviewed by recalling it.
              Both the parties have relied upon judgments in support of their
contention. This court has thought it proper to examine the judgments relied
upon by the parties.
7.            The petitioner has relied upon the judgment rendered in the case
of M. Paul Anthoney Vrs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. (supra) wherein the
Hon’ble Apex Court, after taking into consideration the fact that the same
witnesses were examined in the criminal case and the criminal court, on
consideration of entire evidence, came to the conclusion that no search was
conducted nor any recovery was made from the residence of the appellant of
the said case and therefore the appellant was acquitted and accordingly the
Hon’ble Apex Court taking into consideration both the proceeding based upon
the same facts and evidence without their being any iota of difference,
distinction, as such instead of remitting the matter before the disciplinary
authority for initiating a fresh proceeding since the proceeding was concluded

                                     8
ex parte, the Hon’ble Apex Court has taken a view to reinstate the petitioner
in service considering the fact that the appellant was undergoing the
agony since 1985 despite having been acquitted by the criminal court in the
year 1987. In the said case allegation leveled against the appellant was that
raid was conducted at the appellant’s residence but in course of conducting
raid no incriminating material has been found by the raiding party, as such
he has been acquitted by considering the cases on merit, as such it is
honourable acquittal by the competent court of criminal jurisdiction in which
prosecution has failed to prove the charge beyond all reasonable doubt.
             The judgment rendered in the case of G. M. Tank (supra) is
further been relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the said
judgment has been passed with respect to the allegation of possessing
properties which were alleged to be disproportionate to his known source of
income and for that a departmental proceeding as well as criminal proceeding
had been initiated against him. The appellant of the said case has been
acquitted in the criminal case since the prosecuting agency failed to prove the
charge beyond all reasonable doubt, as such the acquittal by the criminal
court has been treated to be honourable, taking into consideration that aspect
of the matter, the Hon’ble Apex Court has been pleased to observe therein
that when the appellant has been acquitted in the criminal case wherein the
charge has not found to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, as such in a
departmental inquiry wherein the penalty is to be imposed on the finding
recorded on the basis of preponderance of probability, hence acquittal of the

                                      9
appellant in the said case has been given benefit of acquittal from the criminal
case on the ground that since both the proceedings were based upon
same facts and evidence.
              The judgment rendered in the case of S. Bhaskar Reddy and
another Vrs. Superintendent of Police and Another (supra) wherein the
Hon’ble Apex Court, after taking into consideration the judgment rendered in
the case of M. Paul Anthony (supra), G. M. Tank (supra), Inspector General
of Police Vrs. S. Samuthiram (supra), Joginder Singh Vrs. United
Territory of Chandigarh, reported in (2015) 2 SCC 377 and RBI Vrs. Bhopal
Singh Panchal, reported in (1994) 1 SCC 541, wherein the meaning of the
expression of “honourable acquittal” has been taken into consideration, the
Hon’ble Apex Court has been pleased to hold that mere acquittal does not
entitle an employee to reinstatement in service, the acquittal, it was held, has
to be honourable. The expression ‘honourable acquittal’, ‘acquitted of blame’,
‘fully exonerated’ are unknown to the Code of Criminal Procedure or the Penal
Code.
              It has been observed therein that when the accused is acquitted
after full consideration of prosecution evidence and that the prosecution had
miserably failed to prove the charges leveled against the accused, it can
possibly be said that the accused was honourably acquitted.
              The Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of S. Bhaskar Reddy (supra)
has been pleased to take into consideration the acquittal from the criminal

                                         10
case and reversed the order of dismissal to that of compulsory retirement
taking into consideration the fact that both the proceedings were based
upon same facts and evidence.
8.           The learned counsel appearing for the opposite party – Bank has
relied upon the judgment rendered in the case of Avinas Sadashiv Bhosale
(supra) wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court, after taking into consideration all the
judgments on the same issue, has been pleased to hold therein taking into
consideration the fact that the case relates to the appellant who happens to
be an employee of the State Bank of India, Zonal Office, Mumbai working in
the Middle Management Scale –II and found to be indulged in the fraudulent
transaction to the tune of Rs.12 crores. The Hon’ble Apex Court, after taking
into consideration the nature of duty of the officer working in the bank, has
been pleased to observe at paragraph 55 and 56 as follows which is being
referred herein below:-
                     “55. In view of the aforesaid legal principles enunciated and
             reiterated by this Court, we cannot accept that because the appellant
             had been prosecuted, the departmental proceedings could not have been
             continued simultaneously. As pointed out by Mr. Dwivedi, the charges
             against the appellant in the criminal trial related to the commission of
             criminal offences under Sections 120-B, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 201 of
             the Penal Code. The proof of criminal charges depended upon
             prosecution producing proof beyond reasonable doubt relating to the
             culpability of the appellant along with other persons. In the departmental
             proceedings, the basic charge was that the appellant whilst posted as a
             Branch Manager of Washi Turbhe Branch, failed to discharge his duties
             with utmost integrity, honesty, devotion and diligence to ensure and
             protect the interest of the Bank and acted in a manner unbecoming of a
             bank officer. The aforesaid charge clearly related to the manner in which
             the appellant performed the duties as the Manager of the branch of the
             Bank. It had nothing to do with any criminal liability attaching to such
             conduct.

                                         11
                     56. It must be emphasized that bank officials act as trustees of
             funds deposited by the public with the bank. They have an obligation to
             earn the trust and confidence of not only the account-holders but also
             the general public. The standard of integrity required of the bank
             officials, particularly the cashiers, accountants, auditors and the
             management at all levels, is like the Caesar’s wife, they must be above
             suspicion. Mr. Bhosale failed to maintain such high standards of
             integrity. He therefore, acted in violation of Rule 50(4) of the 1992 Rules.
             We, therefore, do not find any merit in the aforesaid submissions of Mr.
             Jain.”
             The Hon’ble Apex Court in the judgment rendered in the case of
Deputy Inspector General of Police and Another Vrs. Samuthiram (supra)
has been pleased to hold therein at paragraph 23 and 26 that mere acquittal
of an employee by a criminal court has no impact on the disciplinary
proceeding initiated by the department. If the delinquent employee has not
been honourably acquitted by the criminal court but only due to the
witnesses having turned hostile and other prosecution witnesses have not
been examined, he cannot get advantage of acquittal in the criminal case by
passing an order of reinstatement in service. It has further been held therein
that in absence of any provision in the service rule for reinstatement, if an
employee is honourably acquitted by a criminal court, no right is conferred on
the employee to claim any benefit including reinstatement.
             Learned counsel for opposite party has also given emphasis upon
judgment rendered in the case of General Manager (Operations) State Bank
of India (supra) wherein the Hon’ble Apex Court has taken into consideration
the meaning of honourable acquittal and by putting reliance upon the same it
has been submitted that the acquittal of the petitioner in the criminal case
cannot be said to be honourable, rather the acquittal is purely on technical

                                      12
ground that the court has taken into consideration the fact that the petitioner
has deposited the entire amount on being detected as also on the ground
that the FIR has been instituted after lapse of some delay without having
explained the reason for delay, hence it cannot be said to be honourable
acquittal.
9.            This court has appreciated the judgments relied upon by the
parties as discussed herein above and also the factual aspect in this case
including the judgment rendered by the competent court of criminal
jurisdiction wherein the trial court, after taking into consideration the
evidence on record which relates to the 5 account holders who have filed
affidavit indicating that the petitioner had not misappropriated any amount
from their accounts, as such the court has observed therein that continuation
of the criminal proceeding would amount to abuse of process. It seems from
the judgment rendered in the criminal case, so far as it relates to the
allegation which is subject matter of the instant departmental proceeding
which relates to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs.25.92 lakhs from his two
overdraft accounts, i.e. Account Nos.10546443595 and 10546443607 in core
banking system, the same has been said to be not an offence merely on
account of the fact that the petitioner has deposited the entire withdrawal
amount along with penal interest, as such the criminal breach of trust has
been held to be not legally sustainable. Thus it is evident from the finding of
the criminal court that since the amount which has been withdrawn by the
petitioner to the tune of Rs.26 lakhs approximately since has been deposited

                                      13
along with interest, the criminal court has acquitted the petitioner by saying
that the ingredient of Section 409, 420 of the I.P.C.     and Sec.13(1)(d) and
13(1)(c) of Prevention of Corruption Act is not being attracted.
              The question herein is that the criminal court has not given a
clean cheat to the petitioner regarding non-commission of irregularities of
fraudulently withdrawing the said amount, rather in course of leading
evidence, it has been proved that there was illegal withdrawal by the
petitioner, but however the same has been deposited in the account, hence it
is to be considered as to whether an officer holding the rank of Scale-I
Manager in the Bank, can be allowed to discharge his duty by mis-utilizing
his official position by withdrawing the amount excess to the limit fixed on
that overdraft account and that is the reason the petitioner has accepted his
guilt before the disciplinary authority, as such the same has been said to be a
gross irregularity by the disciplinary authority while giving the finding in the
departmental enquiry.
10.           The contention raised by the petitioner that on the ground of
acquittal in the criminal case the order of dismissal is to be struck down by
this court sitting under Article 226 of the Constitution of India but according
to the considered view of this court the judgment relied upon by the petitioner
is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand for the
reason that there was honourable acquittal of the delinquent employee related
to those cases and further the appellants in those cases were not the
Bankers.

                                      14
             The Hon’ble Apex Court, while dealing with the case of the
bankers,   has   been   pleased    to  hold   at paragraph 55 and 56 in the
judgment rendered in the case of Avinash Sadashiv Bhosale (supra) wherein
it has been held as has been quoted herein above and at the risk of repetition
the same is being reiterated that “It must be emphasized that bank officials
act as trustees of funds deposited by the public with the bank. They have an
obligation to earn the trust and confidence of not only the account-holders
but also the general public. The standard of integrity required of the bank
officials, particularly   the   cashiers,   accountants,   auditors   and  the
management at all levels, is like the Caesar’s wife, they must be above
suspicion.”
             This   court   has  further  considered   the  definition  of the
honourable acquittal as has been discussed by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the
judgment rendered in the case of Deputy Inspector General of Police Vrs. S.
Samuthiram (supra) wherein the honourable acquittal has been held to be an
acquittal which is being passed by the criminal court after full consideration
of prosecution evidence and that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove
the charges leveled against the accused, then only the accused can be said to
be honourably acquitted.
             As already been observed herein above, the judgment rendered in
the criminal case by the Special Judge, CBI basis upon which the prayer is
being made for reinstatement in service by the petitioner cannot be held to be
honourable acquittal for the reason that the charges leveled against the

                                        15
petitioner has been found to be proved but merely on account of the fact that
since the amount has been deposited so the ingredient of offence leveled
against him of the various sections of IPC as well as Prevention of Corruption
Act has said to be not attracted and further on the ground that there is delay
in filing of FIR, as such it cannot be said to be honourable acquittal.
11.            Moreover, relying upon the judgment rendered in the case of
Deputy Inspector General of Police Vrs. S. Samuthiram (supra) wherein at
paragraph 23 it has been held that mere acquittal of an employee by a
criminal court has no impact on the disciplinary proceeding initiated by the
department (para-23).
               It has further been held therein that in absence of provision in
the service rule for reinstatement, if an employee will be honourably acquitted
by the criminal court, no right is conferred to the employee to claim any
benefit including reinstatement, reason is that the standard of proof required
for holding a person guilty by a criminal court and the enquiry conducted by
way of a disciplinary proceeding is entirely different. In a criminal case, the
onus of establishing the guild of the accused is on the prosecution and if he
fails to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the accused is assumed
to be innocent.
               It is settled law that strict burden of proof required to establish
guilt in a criminal court is not required in a disciplinary proceedings and
preponderance of probabilities is sufficient. There may be cases where a

                                          16
person is acquitted for technical reasons or the prosecution giving up other
witnesses since few of the other witnesses turned hostile, etc.
12.               This Court, after taking into consideration the fact involved in
the instant case and when it has been compared with the ratio laid down by
the Ho’nble Apex Court in various judgments, is of the considered view that
the petitioner cannot derive any benefit from the judgment of acquittal passed
in the criminal case for the reason mentioned herein above.
                  In view thereof and in the entirety of facts and circumstances as
also on the basis of settled proposition by comparing it with the factual aspect
involved in this case, in considered view of this court, the writ petition
deserves no merit, accordingly writ petition fails and it is dismissed.
                                                         ….…………………
