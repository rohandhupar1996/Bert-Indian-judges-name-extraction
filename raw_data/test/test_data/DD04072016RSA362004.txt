  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Date of Hearing ::29.03.2016 :: Date of Judgment 04.07.2016
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                In this appeal, the appellants have called in question, the
judgment and decree passed by the learned Addl. District Judge,
Jajpur in T.A. No. 100 of 1996 confirming the judgment and decree
passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division) Jajpur in T.S. No. 77 of
1990 decreeing the suit filed by the predecessor-in-interest of the
respondent no. 1, who was the original plaintiff declaring the
registered gift deeds said to have been executed by him in favour of the

                                    // 2 //
appellant and respondent no. 2, the defendant no. 1 and 2 respectively
with respect to the suit property as void.
      2.     For the sake of convenience, in order to avoid confusion
  and bring in clarity, the parties hereinafter have been referred to as
  they have been arraigned in the trial court.
             It may be stated that during the suit, the original plaintiff
  having died, the respondent no. 1 being one of his sons and as such
  one legal representative having got substituted himself as the
  plaintiff pursued the suit and also contested the appeal.
      3.     The case of the plaintiff is that he had only Ac. 10
  decimals of homestead land at his native place. From his earning
  from fodder business, at Kolkata, he purchased Ac. 2.46 ½ decimals
  of land at village Kundapada. He had four sons and two of them
  namely, Khetrabasi and Kanhu were given in adoption. From among
  the rest two, elder one was a teacher in primary school of the village
  and other one who is the substituted plaintiff was serving at
  Rourkela.
             The original plaintiff at his old age came to his native place
  leaving Kolkata and looked after cultivation of his lands. It is alleged
  that on 15.10.1988, Ratnakar, the defendant no. 3 took him to his
  house at village Chapri for his treatment and better care. Some days
  thereafter, the defendant no. 3 requested his father to contribute
  some amount for his daughter’s marriage. However, that was not

                                 // 3 //
agreed upon by the original plaintiff. He of course then expressed his
willingness to divide Ac. 1.00 dec. of land from out of his purchased
land between his two sons. It is alleged that the defendant no. 3
then having taken the plaintiff to Sub-Registrar’s Office fraudulently
managed to obtain two gift-deeds in favour of his minor sons i.e.
defendant no. 1 and 2 in respect of his entire land. This being
known     during   the  next   cultivation  season,  the   plaintiff on
15.04.1989 executed a deed of cancellation of those two deeds of
gift.
      4.   The defendant no. 1 to 3 contested the suit inter alia
pleading that the deeds of gift were not taken by fraud and those
had been duly executed by the plaintiff out of his own free will and
volition being overwhelmingly satisfied with the service rendered by
the defendant no. 3 and his wife at his old age. The gifts are said to
have been accepted. The plaintiff having delivered possession of
those lands to the donees through the guardian, those are
accordingly in their possession.
      5.   The trial court in view of rival case framed seven issues.
Out of those, the issue no. 3 is the crucial one concerning the
validity of the deeds of gift and the decision on this issue alone has
the effect of deciding the fate of the suit so as to either grant or
refuse the reliefs to the plaintiff. The trial court applying the
principle of law relating to execution for the deed by pardanashin

                                  // 4 //
woman in view of the old age of the plaintiff and his illiteracy, having
placed the onus of proof upon the defendant no. 1 to 3 to discharge
by leading clear and acceptable evidence on the aspect of executioin
of the deeds of gift eliminating the practice of fraud in the matter,
has on analysis of evidence found that the defendant no. 1 to 3 have
failed to do so. Thus, the two registered gift deeds have been
declared void. However, in view of death of the original plaintiff since
the property came to be succeeded by all his Class-I heirs as find
mention in the schedule of the Hindu Succession Act, the prayer for
declaration of exclusive title advanced by original plaintiff has been
held redundant.
     6.     The lower appellante court having held the plaintiff to be
an illiterate person, has approved the view of the trial court that the
protection of law as available to the pardanashin woman in the
matter of execution of document evidencing the transfer of right,
title and interest over the immovable property is available to the
plaintiff. Next it has held that the burden of proving it lies upon the
person seeking to be benefitted by said transactions eliminating the
suspicions circumstances, that it was bonafide and the execution
being the mental as well as physical act with independent advice. As
is seen at para 8 to 10 of the judgment, the evidence on record being
further put to microscopic examination by an independent exercise,
the view of the lower appellate court has remained the same as that

                                 // 5 //
of the trial court and consequentially the result of the suit stood
unvaried.
           The unsuccessful defendant no. 1 and 3 are now thus in
second appeal, wherein they challenge the concurrent findings of
both the courts as also the result in decreeing the suit declaring the
deeds of gift (Ext. B-1 and C-1) as void to have clothed the vendees
i.e., defendant no. 1 and 2 with no right title and interest in respect
of the properties involved therein.
     7.    The appeal has been admitted on the following substantial
question of law:-
                 Whether the learned courts below have committed
                 an error by not taking into consideration the
                 admission of the executants of the gift deed while
                 decreeing the suit?
     8.    Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the courts
below have committed serious error of law by ignoring the admission
of the plaintiff- executants in the gift deeds Ext. B-1 and C-1 in
writing and as those have remained unexplained; the findings
against the proof of the execution of the deeds of gift are wholly
indefensible. Thus, he contents for recording answers to the
substantial question of law in favour of the appellants. He has cited
the    decisions  reported   in   case    of Natabara    Behera    Vrs.
Batakrushna       Dash;    1999(II)     OLR  319: Ranyammat        Vrs.
Kuppuswami and Another; 2011(II) OLR (SC) 278 and Mst.

    9.    Learned counsel for the respondent no. 1 submits that
such execution of the deeds by the persons who come within the
special cloak of protection of law that in case of challenge to
execution of the documents affecting their interest, the recitals of
the documents cannot be taken to be their admission as in cases of
other category of executants and those will come to have their play
only when the beneficiary of the document proves due execution
both to be mental and physical act of the executant with
independent advice. Therefore, he urges that the substantial
question of law has to be answered in the line that the courts below
have rightly kept so called admission of the executants, the plaintiff
out of consideration.
    10.   The position of law is too well settled that in case of
execution of a document affecting the right by a pardanashin
woman, the burden of proof shall always be upon the person who
seeks to sustain the transaction to establish by clear and acceptable
evidence by preponderance of probability that said execution was
merely not the physical act but mental act too. It can only be
discharged by showing that said executant had understood the
nature of the document and the purpose of it and that having duly
understood the same being read over and explained with the recitals

                                  // 7 //
executed it knowingly. There was independent advice and also that
the acreage involved in the transaction was within the knowledge of
the executants.
           The law is fairly well settled that above protection is also
available so far as illiterate old person is concerned when he stands
as an executant of a document under challenge on that score. This
applies in full force in the facts and circumstances of the case when
it is further seen that the executant, the original plaintiff is none
other than the grandfather of the donees who were then represented
by the son of the donor because of their minority and the deed in
question are deeds of gift which concern with the transaction
without any consideration. Moreover, the defendant no. 3 in his
evidence admits the donor to be illiterate knowing only to sign, his
age at the time being seventy six; he has executed both the deeds of
gift on one day that too gifting away all his properties as has been
deposed to by the witness, D.W. 5 examined on behalf of the
defendant no. 1 to 3. By such execution of the documents, the
executant has thus gone to become totally landless and depriving
his other son and daughter. Furthermore, admittedly the executant
was then residing with the defendant no. 1 under his care and
control, thus said defendant no. 1 remaining in a position to
dominate the will of the executant is not ruled out. The documents
rendering the executants totally landless remaining under the mercy

                                  // 8 //
of others for the rest period of his life to pass prima facie shows that
those are unconscionable.
           In view of all these above, I do not find the approach of the
courts below to be flawed one when it has been said that the burden
of proof of execution of the deeds of gift Ext. B-1 and C-1 rests
squarely upon the defendant no. 1 to 3. In such situation, the
documents themselves cannot be taken along with their recitals to
say that those stand as admission of the executant to bind himd and
thus estopp him to assail. In view of all the aforesaid the courts
below are found to have committed no error in going to examine the
evidence both oral and documentary as well as the circumstances
and other relevant factors arising from evidence to take a final view
as to the sufficiency of the proof of execution of Ext. B-1 and C-1 by
the plaintiff in searching out as to whether the defendant no. 1 to 3
have discharged the burden of proof of said fact resting on them
eliminating the scope of practice of fraud and misrepresentation as
also explaining away all those surrounding circumstances raising
eye brows over the concerned transactions.
    11.    Coming to examine the defensibility of the findings
rendered concurrently by the courts below, the evidence comes from
the side of the defendant no. 1 to 3 through the scribe D.W. 4. He
has merely deposed that the recitals of Ext. B-1 and C-1 were read
over and explained to the plaintiff. D.W. 5 has also so deposed.

                                  // 9 //
However, D.W. 4 has stated on oath to have not known the plaintiff
earlier. He has also stated that defendant no. 3 had gone to him
with the plaintiff. On this aspect, the defendant no. 3 examined as
D.W. 3 has stated that he had not gone and the plaintiff had taken
his wife and he had no knowledge about it and is also unable to give
any reason for it. Next he states to have arranged the attesting
witnesses. The scribe, D.W. 4 further states that defendant no. 3
had shown the land documents and stated the names and age of the
donees. The wife of D.W. 3 being examined as D.W. 5 is silent on the
score as to how that D.W. 4 was chosen as the scribe. In such state
of affair, the evidence, of the plaintiff assumes great importance and
derives good support when he has stated that he did know about the
contents of Ext. –B-1 and C-1. Giving a careful reading to all the
decisions (supra) as cited by the learned counsel for the appellants, I
find that the principles of law find mention therein does not come to
the aid of the plaintiff since the facts and circumstances of those
cases are fully distinguishable. In view of above, this Court
unhesitently holds that the views of the courts below are not the
outcome of perverse appreciation of evidence and finds that the
defendant no. 1 to 3 have failed to discharge the burden of proof of
due execution of those deeds of gifts. It is also seen that on the
question of acceptance of the gift, the lower appellate court being
quite conscious of the law as contained in the provision of section

                                         // 10 //
   122 of the T.P. Act has found the same to have not been proved by
   defendant no. 1 to 3 in view of the evidence of their own witness i.e.
   D.W. 7 who in clear terms has stated that Ratnakar, the plaintiff
   was in possession of the suit land till his death.
                    The aforesaid, discussion and reasons provide necessary
   answer to the substantial question of law running against the
   appellant. In the upshot of above, this Court finds no other
   alternative but to accord the seal of approval to the judgments and
   decrees passed by the courts below.
          12.       Resultantly, the appeal stands dismissed and in the facts
   and circumstances, however, without cost.
   No order as to cost.
