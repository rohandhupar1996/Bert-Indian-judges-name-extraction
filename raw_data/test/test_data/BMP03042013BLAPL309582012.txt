      P R E S E N T:
                       THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA
                                       Date of Order : 03.04.2013
B.N. MAHAPATRA, J.        This petition has been filed under Section 439, Cr. P.C. with
             a prayer to release the petitioner on bail in connection with S.T. Case
             No.21/19 of 2011, now pending in the Court of learned Ad hoc
             Additional Sessions Judge, FTC, Puri corresponding to G.R. Case
             No.1242 of 2007 arising out of Puri Town P.S. Case No.250 of 2007.
             2.           The    petitioner  is    alleged to have    committed    offences
             punishable under Sections 302/294/34, I.P.C. read with Sections 25
             and 27 of the Arms Act.
             3.           Prosecution case, in brief, is that one Ajaya Kumar Sarangi
             @ Hati was killed by gun shot on 30.08.2007 at 9.30 P.M. at Lions’ Gate
             of Lord Jagannath Temple, Puri by the petitioner and other accomplices.

                                      2
The informant, who is the elder brother of the deceased, immediately,
shifted the deceased to Puri Hospital in police mobile van for medical
treatment and due to the critical condition, the victim was referred to
S.C.B., Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack. On the way to Cuttack,
the deceased succumbed to the injuries. Then the informant-Uttam
Kumar Sarangi lodged an FIR and after investigation charge sheet was
submitted showing the petitioner as absconder and subsequently, he
was produced before the court in custody on the strength of NBW(A).
4.           Application for bail filed under Section 439, Cr.P.C. before
the Ad hoc Additional Session Judge, FTC, Puri was rejected on the
ground that there is prima facie material against the accused, who is
alleged to have been involved in a heinous crime like murder and as
many as seven witnesses were already examined by the prosecution by
the date of passing the order. Therefore, in the larger interest of the
society, the learned Ad hoc Additional Sessions Judge, FTC, Puri rejected
the said application.
5.           Mr. T.P. Mohapatra, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that due to previous enmity, the petitioner has been falsely
implicated in the case. The petitioner is a permanent resident of
Sagarpadia, P.S. Basali Sahi, Dist: Puri (Lokanath Road) and he has got
some moveable and immovable properties in that locality. Therefore, if
the petitioner is enlarged on bail, there would be no chance of his
absconding and tampering the evidence. Referring to the statement of

                                       3
Sambhu Singh, S.I., it was submitted that the petitioner has not opened
fire at the deceased.
              In course of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioner filed a
Memo stating therein that other co-accused persons, namely, Madhab
Chandra Khuntia, Akhi @ Akshaya Kumar Mohapatra, Nari @ Narasingh
Mohapatra and Gangadhar Moharana have already been released on
bail. Along with memo he has enclosed copies of bail orders of above co-
accused persons. Placing reliance upon the bail orders enclosed with the
Memo directing release of above named four accused persons, learned
counsel for the petitioner emphatically argued that the petitioner may be
released on bail on the ground of parity.
6.            Learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State submitted
that the petitioner is a prime accused in this case. He is not similarly
situated with that of the other co-accused persons, who have already
been released on bail. It is further submitted that by 06.11.2012, seven
witnesses were examined. Referring to the statement of Madhab
Mohapatra, who is an eye-witness to the occurrence, learned State
counsel submitted that the present petitioner had fired at the deceased
and as per the medical report the deceased died because of gun-shot.
Further, referring to the statement of the informant-Uttam Kumar
Sarangi, it is submitted that in dying declaration the deceased stated
that the present petitioner had opened the gun and fired at him. The
statement of Kishore Chandra Panda and Deva Ray reveals that they

                                      4
identified the petitioner who was running away from the place of
occurrence.
7.           On the rival contentions of the parties, the only question
that falls for consideration by this Court is whether the petitioner has
made out a case for regular bail on the ground of parity.
8.           At this juncture, it would be useful to refer to the judgment
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Dipak Shubhashchandra
Mehta v. CBI, (2012) 4 SCC 134, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court
held as under:
             “32. The Court granting bail should exercise its
             discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter
             of course. Though at the stage of granting bail, a
             detailed examination of evidence and elaborate
             documentation of the merits of the case need not be
             undertaken, there is a need to indicate in such orders
             reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being
             granted, particularly, where the accused is charged of
             having committed a serious offence. The court
             granting bail has to consider, among other
             circumstances, the factors such as (a) the nature of
             accusation and severity of punishment in case of
             conviction and the nature of supporting evidence; (b)
             reasonable apprehension of tampering with the
             witness or apprehension of threat to the complainant;
             and (c) prima facie satisfaction of the court in support
             of the charge. In addition to the same, the court while
             considering a petition for grant of bail in a non-
             bailable offence, apart from the seriousness of the
             offence, likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice
             and tampering with the prosecution witnesses, have to
             be noted.”
9.           Now the question arises as to whether on the basis of the
orders passed by this Court in which four co-accused persons have been
released on bail, the petitioner is entitled to be released on bail on the
plea of parity.

                                     5
            In first bail order dated 08.05.2008 passed in BLAPL
No.2741 of 2008 granting bail to one of the accused namely, Nari @
Narasingh Mohapatra, the above aspects have not been highlighted.
            One of the grounds for granting bail to the other co-accused
persons in subsequent order dated 05.11.2008 passed in BLAPL
No.12759 of 2008, order dated 26.07.2010 in BLAPL No.10029 of 2010
and order dated 14.02.2011 in BLAPL No.23128 of 2010 is that co-
accused   has   already   been   released  on  bail  in   the  meantime.
Undoubtedly, in the instant case, accusations are serious in nature, i.e.,
the deceased was killed by gunshot near Lions’ Gate of Lord Jagannath
Temple, Puri.
10.         At this stage, it would be relevant to quote some of the
judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and High Court.
            In Special Leave Petition No.4059 of 2000 (Rakesh Kumar
Pandey Vs. Munni Singh @ Mata Bux Singh and another, decided on
12.3.2001), the Hon’ble Supreme Court strongly denounced the order of
the High Court granting bail to the co-accused on the ground of parity in
a heinous offence and while cancelling the bail granted by the High
Court, the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed as under :-
            “The High Court on being moved, has considered
            the application for bail and without bearing in
            mind the relevant materials on record as well as
            the gravity of offence released the accused-
            respondents on bail, since the co-accused, who
            had been ascribed similar role, had been granted
            bail earlier.
                   xx          xx          xx          xx

                                     6
                  Suffice it to say that for a serious charge
           where three murders have been committed in
           broad day light, the High Court has not applied
           its mind to the relevant materials, and merely
           because some of the co-accused, whom similar
           role has been ascribed, have been released on
           bail earlier, have granted bail to the present
           accused respondents. It is true that State
           normally should have moved this Court against
           the order in question, but at the same time the
           power of this Court cannot be fettered merely
           because the State has not moved, particularly in
           a case like this, where our conscience is totally
           shocked to see the manner in which the High
           Court has exercised its power for release on bail
           of the accused respondents. We are not
           expressing any opinion on the merits of the
           matter as it may prejudice the accused in trial.
           But we have no doubt in our mind that the
           impugned order passed by the High Court
           suffers from gross illegality and is an order on
           total non-application of mind and the judgment
           of this Court referred to earlier analyzing the
           provisions of sub-section (2) of section 439
           cannot be of any use as we are not exercising
           power under sub-section (2) of section 439
           Cr.P.C.”
11.        The Allahabad High Court in the case of Salim Vrs. State
of UP, 2003 ALL LJ 625 has held that there is no absolute hidebound
rule that bail must necessarily be granted to the co-accused where
another co-accused has been granted bail irrespective of the gravity of
offence.
12.        The Allahabad High Court in the case of Chander alias
Chandra vs. State of U.P., 1998 CRI.L.J. 2374, held as under:
           “21. Our answers to the questions referred are as
           follows:
           1.     If the order granting bail to an accused is not
           supported by reasons, the same cannot form the
           basis for granting bail to a co-accused on the
           ground of parity.

                                      7
             2.      A judge is not bound to grant bail to an
             accused on the ground of parity even where the
             order granting bail to an identically placed co-
             accused contains reasons, if the same has been
             passed in flagrant violation of well settled principle
             and ignores to take into consideration the relevant
             factors essential for granting bail.”
13.          Needless to say that the law of parity is a desirable rule.
However, where the allegations of heinous crime are serious in nature
against the accused and not against co-accused the accused cannot
claim parity with that of the co-accused in the matter of bail. Thus,
where two accused persons are not identically placed reliance on bail of
one accused does not entitle the other co-accused to be released on bail.
The ground of parity is not the compelling reason for granting bail.
14.          In view of the above, parity cannot be the sole ground for
granting bail; it is one of the grounds for consideration of the question of
bail. The orders granting or refusing bail are orders of interlocutory
nature. The Court has to satisfy itself on consideration of materials
placed that there are sufficient grounds for releasing the applicant on
bail. The discretion in passing interim orders should be exercised
judicially. Rule of parity is not applicable in all the cases. Each case for
bail has to be considered on its own merit.
15.          Keeping in mind the gravity of offence, materials available on
record and the above principles of law, now I have to consider the
present petition for grant of bail.
16.          At this juncture, it is relevant to refer to the bail order
granted to the co-accused namely, Nari @ Narasingh Mohapatra, who

                                     8
has been released on bail by this Court vide order dated 08.05.2008 in
BLAPL No.2741 of 2008. Perusal of the said order reveals that
considering the submission of the parties and the period of the
petitioner’s detention in jail bail has been granted to the petitioner
Nari@Narasingh Mohapatra.
             Vide order dated 05.11.2008 in BLAPL No.12759 of 2008,
another co-accused namely, Gangadhar Moharana was granted bail on
the ground of parity with that of the co-accused namely, Nari @
Narasingh Mohapatra, who was granted bail by this Court on 08.05.2008
in BLAPL No.2741 of 2008, and another co-accused namely, Debendra
Kumar Nayak, who was granted bail by the Sessions Judge, Puri on
26.02.2008 in B.A. No.106 of 2008.
             Co-accused Madhab Khuntia has been released on bail vide
order dated 26.07.2010 in BLAPL No.10029 of 2010 taking into
consideration the submission of petitioner’s counsel that there is no
allegation against the petitioner that he had fired at the deceased and
that bail has been granted to the co-accused persons as well as the
period of his under trial detention.
             Another co-accused namely, Akshaya Kumar Mohapatra was
granted bail by this Court vide BLAPL No.23128 of 2010 on the ground
that in the dying declaration the said petitioner has not been implicated
and that the co-accused namely, Madhab Chandra Khuntia has been
released on bail.

                                           9
17.                The ground on which bail has been granted to above four co-
accused persons clearly shows that the present petitioner is not on the
similar footing. Evidence of the eyewitness namely, Madhab Mohapatra
reveals that the petitioner had fired at the deceased. Dying declaration
made before the informant further reveals that the petitioner had fired at
the deceased. Other witnesses in their statements stated that they saw
the petitioner running away from the place of occurrence.
18.                In view of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the
petitioner is not on the similar footing with that of the other co-accused
persons, who have already been released on bail. By the time, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge passed the order rejecting the bail
application of the present petitioner, seven witnesses had already been
examined.
19.                In view of the above, this Court is not inclined to accept the
prayer for bail of the petitioner. Accordingly, the BLAPL is rejected.
20.                The learned Trial Court is directed to conclude the trial of
the case as early as possible keeping in mind the provisions of Section
309, Cr.P.C. avoiding unnecessary adjournments.
                                                        ……………………...
