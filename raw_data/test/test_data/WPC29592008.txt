                                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                                Heard Mr. A.K. Purakayastha, the learned Counsel appearing for
                 the petitioners. The first two respondents are represented by Mr. J. Handique,
                 the learned Government Advocate. The Standing Counsel for the Karbi Anglong
                 Autonomous Council (hereinafter referred to as “the KAAC”) is not present in
                 Court.
                 2.             The advertisement dated 6.5.2005 (Annexure-2) was issued by
                 the District Sports Officer of the Karbi Anglong District for application of those
                 interested to be deputed for training for the Bachelor of Physical Education (B.P.
                 Ed.) Course, in the college of Physical Education, Amravati in Maharashtra. The
                 candidates were to be paid stipend to undertake the Course and the
                 advertisement indicated that the names of the successful candidates will be
                 forwarded to the Director of Sports and Youth Welfare, Assam for appointment
                 as Physical Instructors. The four petitioners were deputed for the aforesaid
                 training to Maharastra and they were issued the degree in Physical Education by
                 the Amravati College. The provisional certificate in respect of the 1st petitioner is
                 enclosed here as Annexure-7.
                 3.             After completion of training, the petitioners expected to be
                 appointed as Physical Instructors. The record shows that numerous letters were
                 written by the authorities of the KAAC to the Government of Assam for creation
                 of posts of Physical Instructors for the Karbi Anglong District. The justification for
                 creation of such posts is reflected in the letter dated 23.2.2006 (Page-42) written
                 by the District Sports Officer Karbi Anglong to the Director of Sports and Youth
                 Welfare, Government of Assam. The views of the Karbi Anglong authorities was
                 also conveyed to the Government for sanctioning of 9 posts, through the letter
                 dated 24.2.2006 (Annexure-17).
                 4.             However since the requested posts were not sanctioned and the
WP(C) No.2959/2008
                                                                                Page 2 of 5

                                                         3
                 petitioners were unable to secure appointment, they have approached this Court
                 for a direction on the State Government to create the posts of Instructors of
                 Physical Education, on the basis of recommendation made by the KAAC.
                 5.             Mr. A.K. Purkayastha, the learned Counsel submits that the
                 petitioners underwent the training in the Maharashtra College with the
                 expectation of getting appointed to the posts of Physical Instructors but since the
                 posts have not been sanctioned, the hopes of the trained degree holders have
                 been belied.
                 6.             On the other hand, Mr. J. Handique, the learned Government
                 Advocate refers to the counter affidavit filed by the respondent No.2 to project
                 that the posts of Physical Instructors are not created District wise but a State
                 cadre is created under the Directorate of Sports and Youth Welfare and the
                 appointed Physical Instructors are posted throughout the State and some
                 Instructors are also deputed to the Karbi Anglong District through the authorities
                 of the KAAC.
                 7.             As regards the deputation of petitioners for training to Maharastra,
                 the learned Government Advocate submits that the State Government has
                 stopped such deputation from the year 1998-1999 and therefore it is contended
                 that the authorities of the KAAC should not have deputed anyone for training
                 without prior approval of the State Government.
                 8.             From the materials on record, it appears that in pursuant to a
                 recruitment process started by the Director of Sports and Youth Welfare, a Select
                 List of 80 candidates was notified on 25.3.2008 (Annexure-23) and in terms of
                 the judgment of this Court rendered on 3.6.2008 (Annexure-24) in the WP(C)
                 No.166/2008 and other connected cases, all selected persons were appointed
                 and this process except for 2 appointees was approved by the High Court
                 through its judgment. Consequently 78 from the Select List of 80 were appointed
                 as Physical Instructors by the Director of Sports and Youth Welfare and this
WP(C) No.2959/2008
                                                                               Page 3 of 5

                                                           4
                 includes 5 from the batch of nine who underwent training with the petitioners.
                 9.              What emerges from the above discussion is that the posts are not
                 specifically created for the Karbi Anglong District and Physical Instructors are to
                 be selected and appointed for the entire State, under the State’s Directorate of
                 Sports and Youth Welfare. The Select List notified on 25.3.2008 (Annexure-23)
                 indicates that 5 of those deputed for training to Maharashtra by the KAAC had
                 secured appointment through the selection process undertaken by the
                 respondent No.2 and those appointees are now posted in different districts of
                 Assam.
                 10.             Whether any additional posts of Physical Instructors should be
                 created in the State’s common pool to take into account the requirement of the
                 schools in the Karbi Anglong District is a matter within the domain of the State
                 Authorities. To sanction posts various factors including the Government’s
                 financial capability are required to be taken into account. Therefore it may not be
                 appropriate for the Writ Court to direct the State Authorities to create additional
                 posts of Physical Instructors as is demanded by the authorities of the KAAC.
                 11.              But at the same time, Mr. A.K.Purkayastha, the learned Counsel
                 for the petitioners has projected from the correspondence made by the
                 authorities of the KAAC and the State Government that a process was on to
                 assess to need of Physical Instructors to be posted in the Karbi Anglong District.
                 The letter dated 23.2.2006 of the District Sports Officer of Karbi Anglong shows
                 that only 5 Instructors are serving in the entire District whereas the requirement
                 of the schools within the District can’t be addressed by these few officers. While
                 creation of posts only for the Karbi Anglong District may not be justified in view
                 of the common pool of Physical Instructors for the entire State within the
                 administrative domain of the Directorate of Sports and Youth Welfare, the
                 augmentation of the common pool to meet the requirement in a deficient district
                 should in my view receive due consideration of the State Authorities. Of course
WP(C) No.2959/2008
                                                                               Page 4 of 5

                                                           5
                 the financial implications and other factors can’t naturally be ignored while taking
                 a decision on creation of posts.
                 12.             In view of the above discussion, I feel that a direction should be
                 issued to the State Government to take a decision on the merit of the
                 recommendation made by the authorities of the KAAC for creation of more posts
                 of Physical Instructors so that adequate numbers can be spared to the Karbi
                 Anglong District from the State’s common pool under the Director of Sports and
                 Youth Welfare. If creation of posts is not feasible, the State may depute more
                 Physical Instructors from the common pool to meet the requirement in the Karbi
                 Anglong District. To facilitate the consideration by the State as suggested the
                 petitioners are permitted to address a representation within 4 weeks through the
                 authorities of the KAAC and the said representation is ordered to be considered
                 on merit by the competent authority within 3 months of receipt of the same.
                 With this direction, the case is disposed of without any order on cost.
                                                                                             JUDGE
