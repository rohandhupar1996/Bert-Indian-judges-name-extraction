                  JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL )
        The Oriental Insurance Company Limited being appellant has preferred
this appeal under Section 30 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (now
renamed as Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923) Challenging the judgment and
award dated 08.06.2004 passed by learned W.C. Commissioner, Nagaon in
N.W.C. Case No. 57/2001 directing the insurance company to make payment of
Rs. 1,41,120/- as compensation to the claimant, namely, Jamaluddin within a
period of 30 days along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum w.e.f.
10.02.2001.
2.      One Md. Jamaluddin, as claimant, submitted claim petition before the
W.C. Commissioner, Nagaon stating that he was engaged as handyman in a mini
bus having registration No. NLW-2872 belonging to one Ranjit Kuri. The vehicle
met with an accident on 10.02.2001 at around 6.30 A.M. at Nonoi Badalgaon on
N.H. No. 36 and thereupon he received injuries which resulted in permanent
partial disablement. He was treated at Nagaon Civil Hospital by Dr. Durgeswar
Borah and G.D. Entry No. 176 was made by Nagaon Traffic Police on the same
day. The owner did not appear even after service of notice and so the
proceeding was held ex-parte against him. The insurance company, however,
appeared and submitted written statement. In course of the proceeding, claimant
                                                                     Page 2 of 7

examined himself as PW 1 and Dr. Durgeswar Borah as PW 2. Insurance
company examined one K.K. Paul as D.W. PW 1 proved accident information
report, prescription of Nagaon Civil Hospital, prescription issued by Dr.
Durgeswar Borah and disability certificate as Ext. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
He also proved the X-ray plates as materials Exts. 1 and 2. In course of cross
examination, he claimed that he was 20 years of age at the relevant time and
that he had sustained injury in the aforesaid incident resulting in fracture of left
patella and 9th rib. PW 2, Dr. Durgeswar Borah stated that he issued certificate of
examination of the patient and found that the claimant was rendered disabled to
the extent of 25% because of which he lost his earning capacity to the tune of
50%. However, in course of cross examination he stated that because of his
treatment there was sufficient improvement of the patient and the claimant
became capable of doing some works besides certain limitations. However, he
stood by his deposition that physical disability was permanent. Considering the
evidence of the witnesses of both sides, the W.C. Commissioner did not accept
the contention of the doctor that the claimant has lost earning capacity of 50%
but held that the claimant lost earning capacity to the extent of 35% and
thereupon made the calculation of compensation and directed the insurance
company to make payment of Rs. 1,41,120/-. He also allowed interest at the rate
of 12% per annum w.e.f. the date of application till realisation. This judgment
and award has been brought under challenge by the insurance company in the
present appeal.
3.      This court while admitting the appeal on 21.02.2011, framed the
following two substantial questions of law:-
                                                                         Page 3 of 7
MFA 16/2005

                        (1)      Whether     Commissioner   under     Workmen’s
                        Compensation Act, 1923 can assess wage of an employee
                        taking together salary and allowances, contrary to the
                        definition of wage in section 2(m) of the Workmen’s
                        Compensation Act, 1923?
                        (2)      Whether Commissioner under the Workmen’s
                        Compensation Act can assess loss of earning capacity of a
                        workman of its own, when injury sustained by the claimant
                        is a non schedule injury?
4.      I have heard Mr. SK Goswami, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr.
A Kundu, learned counsel for the respondent No. 1. None appears for the
respondent No. 2 owner.
5.      Mr. SK Goswami, learned counsel for the appellant, fairly submits that
first substantial question of law framed by this court on 21.02.2011 has lost its
significance after passing of the judgment by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the
case of United India Insurance Company vs. Ameeruddin reported in (2011) 1
SCC 304. The first substantial question of law, however, does not require any
adjudication. Arguing the second substantial question of law, Mr. SK Goswami
submits that the W.C. Commissioner was at liberty to accept the opinion of the
qualified medical practitioner. The W.C. Commissioner in the present case has
neither accepted the opinion of the qualified medical practitioner nor has he
called for the second opinion from anyone but has presumed that the claimant
had lost earning capacity to the extent of 35% by himself and this is not
permissible within the scope under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the Workmen’s
                                                                        Page 4 of 7
MFA 16/2005

Compensation Act, 1923. Mr. Goswami, therefore, argues that impugned
judgment and order has become vitiated for such jurisdictional error of the W.C.
Commissioner.
6.      In the case in hand, the claimant sustained injury on two parts of his
body. He has suffered fracture of the right patella and fracture on the 9th rib.
According to him, because of these two injuries he cannot work as handyman
anymore and he not being a driver or conductor cannot do any work relating to
the motor vehicles. The learned W.C. Commissioner accepted this contention of
the claimant after considering the evidence adduced by the qualified medical
practitioner as PW 2. According to Mr. SK Goswami, learned counsel for
appellant, once PW 2 admitted in his cross examination that there was some
improvement after treatment of the claimant, the injury sustained by him can no
longer be considered as permanent one and under such circumstances, assessing
compensation under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) cannot arise.
7.      I have perused the cross examination of PW 2. PW 2 has stated in course
of cross examination that he gave treatment to the claimant and upon such
treatment there was improvement in the condition of the victim. Even thereafter
he stated that the disability is permanent. So certificate given by PW 2 and his
deposition in support of permanent disability of the claimant, remain even after
improvement acquired by the claimant by way of treatment. From the trend of
cross examination, I do not find that any question was put to the PW 2 as to loss
of earning capacity of the claimant. What is required from a qualified medical
practitioner is his opinion as to assessment of loss of earning capacity as
provided under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923.
                                                                       Page 5 of 7
MFA 16/2005

Since, he claimed in his examination-in-chief that the claimant had lost 50% of
the earning capacity and there was no cross examination on this point, his
examination-in-chief went unrebutted into evidence and in that event, there is no
scope to interfere with the finding of the learned W.C. Commissioner.
8.      It cannot be said that the findings arrived at by the learned W.C.
Commissioner is not based on any assessment of a qualified medical practitioner.
There is nothing in statute to hold that the learned W.C. Commissioner is either
to accept the opinion of the qualified medical practitioner in entirety or to reject
the same in entirety. Assessment made by the qualified medical practitioner is
only a basis for arriving at the opinion by the W.C. Commissioner. Ultimately, it is
the jurisdictional W.C. Commissioner who has been endorsed with the
responsibility to assess compensation. The W.C. Commissioner definitely is at
liberty to apply his mind to find as to whether the opinion can be accepted in
entirety or it needs to be rejected. Mr. SK Goswami submits that if a leg of a
claimant is amputed below knee in that event, under Part II of Schedule I, he is
to be held to have lost 50% of his earning capacity. Here in this case, the
claimant did not lose any part of his limb but he merely suffered from fracture of
patella. Perhaps it is because of this reason, the opinion of the doctor as to 50%
of loss of earning capacity was not accepted by the learned W.C. Commissioner.
The W.C. Commissioner had some material in front of him to arrive at a finding
which is nothing but an assessment made by the qualified medical practitioner
and so the second substantial question of law does not arise under the facts and
circumstances of this case.
                                                                          Page 6 of 7
MFA 16/2005

9.      Coming to the judgment and award challenged in this appeal it appears
that even on the date of passing of the award, the learned W.C. Commissioner
allowed interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of the
application which does not appear to be in conformity of provision of Section 4A
of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. The question of penal interest will
arise only if the payment is not made within a period of 30 days from the date of
falling due. The date of falling due is the date of adjudication and it is only
thereafter the question of making payment of compensation would arise. This
being the position, the finding of the learned W.C. Commissioner in regard to
payment of interest cannot be upheld. Mr. SK Goswami, learned counsel for the
appellant, submits that before presenting the Memo of Appeal, the insurance
company had already deposited entire awarded amount with the jurisdictional
Commissioner and the amount was also disbursed to the claimant. Under such
circumstances, there is no question of making payment of interest anymore. The
insurance company, therefore, is not liable to make any other payment. With
these observations, the appeal stands closed.
10.     No order as to costs.
                                                                       JUDGE
