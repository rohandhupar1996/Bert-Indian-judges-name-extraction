                          ---------
PRESENT:
               THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE D.DASH
      Date of hearing- 17.6.2015     : Date of judgment-30.06.2015
                This is an appeal under Section 299 of the Indian
Succession Act challenging the order of the learned District Judge,
Balasore-Bhadrak in O.S. No.1 of 2007 granting probate in respect of
the Will annexed accepting the prayer of the respondent.
2.              Facts necessary for disposal of this appeal are as
under:-

                                       2
                   One Madhabananda Jena had executed a Will in
favour of his son Bhagabat Prasad Jena on 13.1.1998. It is said that
the Will was duly executed by Madhabananda followed by its
registration in the District Sub-Registrar Office, Balasore on that very
day. The Will is said to be the last Will and testatament of said
Madhabananda Jena who died on 24.9.1998. The beneficiary under
the Will namely, Bhagabat Prasad Jena died unmarried on 22.5.2001.
The respondent claiming to be the sole legal heir of Bhagabat Prasad
Jena has sought for grant of the probate as aforesaid. It is stated that
the said Will being duly executed by Madhabananda Jena was also
attested in accordance with and as required under law. The Will is
asserted to be genuine and authenticate one.
                  The   appellant  appearing    in   the  said   probate
proceeding contested the claim for grant of probate of the Will,
claiming herself to be the second wife of the testator Madhabananda
Jena. She also challenged that the Will was not duly executed and
attested. It is her case that the Will was fraudulently created for the
purpose of usurping the property of Madhabananda Jena depriving the
appellant of her lawful claim over it. She also claims to have the right

                                       3
to succeed to the property of Madhabananda Jena with the
respondent.
3.               The learned District Judge on going through the
evidence adduced by the respondent and also the certified copy of the
Will proved as secondary evidence has finally granted the probate as
prayed for and that is now under challenge in this appeal.
4.               Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
                 Perused the petition for grant of probate to the Will
said to have been executed by the Madhabananda Jena on 13.1.1998.
I have also perused the petition filed by the present appellant for being
impleaded as a party and her objection to the petition for probate.
5.               It reveals from the lower court record that by order
dated 3.12.2003, the petition for grant of probate to the so-called Will
as prayed for by the petitioner was admitted. The order was also
passed for issuance of notice to the opposite party in both ways and
also for issuance of general citation. In fact, the petitioner had not
impleaded any one as opposite party in the cause title of her petition
nor it has been so indicated in the cause title of the court’s first order

                                        4
sheet. The present appellant has been arraigned as an opposite party
on the basis of her suo moto appearance and filing of the petition dated
31.7.2006 which was allowed by order dated 20.10.2006. Thereafter,
she filed her objection. In the petition filed by the respondent, it stands
as the averment at para-9 that the name of the other relative of the
deceased-testator has been given in schedule ‘B’ and schedule ‘B’ finds
mention as the following:-
                  Gitanjali Das aged about 22 years, W/o- Sanjay Das
of village Naharjara, P.O.- Purunda, P.S. Belda, Dist. Midnapur.
                  The order sheet reveals that there was no service of
notice upon the said Gitanjali Das and simply because service return
of general citation was received back, the probate petition was posted
for hearing.
                  Now when the objection filed by the present appellant
is perused, it is seen that she has objected to the address of that
Gitanjali Das given in the petition as not correct. Specifically, she has
stated that the opposite party was then residing at Raisuan, Balasore.
Furthermore, in her objection, she has clearly stated her status to be
the    legally married     wife  of    Madhabananda       after death    of

                                       5
Madhabananda’s first wife while simultaneously pleading that this
respondent was working as a maid servant for looking after the
household work and taking care of ailing first wife of Madhabananda.
It is also stated that Gitanjali Das is the daughter of Madhabananda
being born to her. Nowhere in the petition for probate either the
relationship of Gitanjali Das with the deceased-Madhabananda or any
such relationship to have been so claimed by Gitanjali Das has been
indicated though it was incumbent upon the respondent to state so.
Thus, it appears that said Gitanjali Das has not been noticed which
was mandatory in a proceeding of this nature. In the entire order
sheets, said service of notice upon Gitanjali has not been mentioned.
                  The service of notice as above mentioned being
mandatory as required under Section 283 of the Indian Succession
Act, the final order of grant of probate with Will annexed becomes
vulnerable.
6.                In that view of the matter without going into the merit
of the case, this Court is constrained to set aside the order dated
30.9.2010 passed by the learned District Judge, Balasore-Bhadrak in

                                          6
O.S. No. 1 of 2007 granting the probate in respect of the Will annexed
accepting the prayer of the respondent.
7.                    In the result, the appeal stands allowed and in the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case without cost. The order of
grant of probate as above is hereby set aside and the matter is
remitted to the court of learned District Judge, Balasore to proceed
afresh by issuance of notice to Gitanjali Das as indicated and dispose
of the petition for grant of probate on merit in accordance with law
after giving due opportunity of production of further evidence and
hearing to the parties.
                                                     ….………………
