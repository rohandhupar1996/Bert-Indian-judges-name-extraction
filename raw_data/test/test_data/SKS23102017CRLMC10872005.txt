                          THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Date of Hearing & Judgment: 23.10.2017
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. K. SAHOO, J.           This is an application under section 482 of Cr.P.C.
        filed by the petitioner Babula Singh challenging the impugned
        order dated 25.02.2005 passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Khariar
        in I.C.C. Case No. 3 of 2004 in taking cognizance of the offences

                                    2
punishable under sections 420/506 of the Indian Penal Code and
issuance of process against him.
2.           The    opp.  party   no.2  Basudev   Ghivela  filed  a
complaint petition in the Court of learned J.M.F.C., Khariar
against the petitioner, on the basis of which I.C.C. Case No. 3 of
2004 was registered.
             It is the case of the complainant-opp. party no.2 that
the complainant was possessing a piece of Government land and
he approached the petitioner who was the Revenue Inspector to
settle the land in his favour and the petitioner told him that the
land would be settled if a sum of Rs.3,000/- (rupees three
thousand) is deposited as Government fees. It is the further case
of the complainant that since he was illiterate, he arranged
Rs.3,000/- (rupees three thousand) and paid it to the petitioner
for settlement of land in the month of December 2002 and the
petitioner assured the complainant to settle the land within a
year but the same was not done and even the money which was
taken by the petitioner was not refunded in spite of several
approach by the complainant. It is further stated in the
complaint petition that on 18.01.2004 when the complainant
approached the petitioner for refund of the amount, the
petitioner got enraged and abused him.

                                  3
            After filing of the complaint petition, the learned
J.M.F.C., Khariar sent it to officer in-charge of Sinapalli police
station under section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. for registration of the
F.I.R. and investigation and accordingly, Sinapalli P.S. Case No.
13 of 2004 was registered on 13.01.2004 against the petitioner
under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code.
            During course of investigation, numbers of witnesses
were examined and the Investigating Officer found that there is
no evidence to prove the payment of cash to the petitioner. It
was further found that since the land was an encroached land,
therefore, the petitioner as the Revenue Inspector could not
have taken steps to settle the land in favour of the complainant
against whom he had initiated a case i.e. Encroachment Case
No. 2382 of 2001 for which after transfer of the petitioner, the
complainant had filed the complaint petition with a view to
harass the petitioner. The Circle Inspector supervised the case
and accordingly final report was submitted indicating it to be a
false case.
3.          It appears that after submission of the final report,
the complainant-opp. party no.2 filed a protest petition and
accordingly, the initial statement of the complainant was
recorded and inquiry contemplated under section 202 of Cr.P.C.

                                  4
was    conducted,     during course  of   which   the  complainant
examined two witnesses. The learned Magistrate after perusing
the complaint petition, the initial statement as well as the
statements of the witnesses recorded under section 202 of
Cr.P.C. found prima facie case for commission of offences under
sections 420/506 of the Indian Penal Code and accordingly, took
cognizance of such offences which is impugned in this application
under section 482 Cr.P.C.
4.           Mr. Debasish Pattanaik, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner contended that the complaint petition has been
filed with an ulterior motive to harass the petitioner as the
petitioner    initiated   an  encroachment     case   against  the
complainant for encroaching the government land and turned
down the request of the complainant to record such land in his
favour.    It is further contended that the officer in-charge of
Sinapalli police station after due investigation of the case which
was supervised by the Circle Inspector, Khariar, found it to be a
false case. It is further contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that no prima facie case is made out to attract the
ingredients of the offences under sections 420/506 of the Indian
Penal Code and therefore, the impugned order should be
quashed.

                                  5
            Learned counsel for the State, Mr. Prem Kumar
Pattnaik supported the impugned order.
5.           It is not disputed that at the relevant point of time,
the petitioner was the Revenue Inspector at Hatibandha and
encroachment case bearing no.2382 of 2001 was instituted
against the opp. party no.2-complainant for encroaching the
government land appertaining to Khata No. 83, Plot No. 721,
Ac.1.40   decimal.   It  is  also not   disputed  that  after   due
investigation of the case, it was found that there is no evidence
relating to payment of cash of Rs.3,000/- (rupees three
thousand)    by the complainant to the petitioner. On perusal of
the complaint petition, it appears that    though it is mentioned
that    the complainant arranged Rs.3,000/- (rupees three
thousand) and paid it to the petitioner in the           month of
December      2002 but no documentary proof relating to such
payment has been annexed to the complaint petition. Though in
the initial statement, the complainant has stated that the
payment of Rs.3,000/- (rupees three thousand) was made in
presence of Bidyadhar Nag and Gautam Meher but nothing has
been mentioned in the complaint petition as to in whose
presence, the money was paid. The evidence of the two
witnesses examined by the complainant in the inquiry under

                                     6
section 202 of Cr.P.C. are also contrary to the evidence of the
complainant.
                 On a plain reading of the complaint petition, the
ingredients of the offence under section 506 of the Indian Penal
Code are not attracted. In view of the background of the case,
the materials available on record and the fact that the version of
the complainant in the complaint petition runs contrary to his
initial statement and the statements of the witnesses under
section 202 of Cr.P.C. are also discrepant in nature and more
particularly when there is lack of documentary evidence relating
to payment of money by the complainant to the petitioner, I am
of the view that the learned J.M.F.C., Khariar has committed the
illegality in passing the impugned order and therefore, invoking
inherent power under section 482 of Cr.P.C., I am inclined to
quash the impugned order.
                  Accordingly, the CRLMC application is allowed. The
impugned order dated 25.02.2005 passed by the learned
J.M.F.C., Khariar in I.C.C. Case No.3 of 2004 stands quashed.
                                                  .................................
                                                     S. K. Sahoo, J.
