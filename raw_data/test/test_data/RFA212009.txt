                           JUDGMENT AND ORDER(ORAL)
                 Defendants of Money Suit No. 55 of 2000, namely, State of
       Assam and its Officers in the Department of Forest, have preferred this
       first appeal challenging the judgment and decree dated 11.12.2008
       passed by the learned Civil Judge, No.1, Kamrup, Guwahati whereby the
       suit of the plaintiff for realization of Rs. 52,60,943/- was decreed.
       2.          The respondent herein as plaintiff instituted Money Suit No. 55
       of 2000 in the Court of learned Civil Judge, No.1, Kamrup, Guwahati
       through her constituted Attorney , Nityananda Kalita. In the plaint, the
       pleaded case of plaintiff was that plaintiff being owner in possession of 12
       Bigha 2 Katha 17 lechas of land covered by Dag No. 146, 147, 148 of

       trees thereon. This land she had purchased by registered sale deed
       No.582 dated 8.3.1988 from its original owner and obtained mutation in
       the records of right. The plaintiff’s land is surrounded by boundary
       fencing and in no point of time, there was any dispute in regard to
       possession or title over the same . She engaged a chowkidar for the
       purpose of guarding the properties. There was fencing in view of the fact
       that at the time of purchasing , there was standing sal trees thereon
       which was fit for the timber production. On 22.5.1991, a devastating
       cyclone hit the area and in the result large number of sal trees standing
       on the same land had been uprooted. By engaging workers , plaintiff
       started cutting the some of the trees which have been uprooted and
       broken. In the meantime, defendant No. 5 along with some other officers
       forced their entry into the land and prepared a coup being No.61. They
       also started to cut the branches of the fallen trees and made the portion
       of the trees belonging to the plaintiff. The vehement protest raised by the
       plaintiff did not yield any result. Defendant No. 5 and his men produced
       176.4193 cubic meter of timber from the trees on the land of the plaintiff.
       They also gathered huge quantity of firewood from the branches of the
       fallen trees and they were worth of several trucks. Defendant No. 5 did
       not allow the plaintiff and her men to operate on the fallen trees and did
       not pay any heed to the protest or request raised by the plaintiff. Situated
       thus, plaintiff approached local police station to advise the plaintiff to
RFA No.21 of 2008                                           Page 3 of 29

       approach the court of law. Plaintiff , therefore, initiated a proceeding
       under Section 144 Cr.P.C. before the learned Executive Magistrate at
       Guwahati to pass prohibitory order on 25.6.1991 and restraining the
       defendants from taking any action with respect to the land of the plaintiff
       described in schedule to the plaint. The defendant No. 5 and his men
       failed to comply with the order dated 25.6.1991 and took possession of
       the timbers and the firewood measuring 289.285 cubic meter. Plaintiff
       herself had cut down 40 trucks of firewood from the branch of trees
       spending a sum of Rs.48,000/- and the entire timber and the firewood
       was stocked     over the part of the plaintiff ‘s land wrongly claimed by
       defendant No. 6 to be of coup No. 61 . Under such circumstances,
       plaintiff had to approach the learned Executive Magistrate and thereupon
       a proceeding under Section 145/146 Cr.P.C was initiated. The learned
       Executive Magistrate passed an order u/s 146 Cr.P.C. and thereby
       attached the land along with timbers. The defendant No. 5 challenged
       this order before the learned Sessions Judge vide Criminal Revision No.
       109 of 1991 who stayed the order passed by the learned Magistrate on
       28.8.1991. Taking opportunity of this order, the defendants removed all
       trees , logs and firewood from the attached land. However, learned
       Sessions Judge passed an order directing the officer-in-charge of Boko
       Police Station to make a complete and detailed inventory of all articles
       and submit copy of inventory to the court and also to keep watch and to
RFA No.21 of 2008                                           Page 4 of 29

       protect the property till the same is disposed of by the Court. Accordingly,
       Boko Police Station made an inventory of all the timbers and firewood and
       submitted the same to the court of learned Sessions Judge, Kamrup.
       However, subsequently, the Criminal Revision was dismissed and the trial
       magistrate was directed to decide the case as to whether the land in
       question was patta        land as claimed by plaintiff. The 145 Cr.P.C.
       proceeding was thereupon tried by the learned Executive Magistrate in
       course of which the revenue officer made spot verification and submitted
       report to the effect that the land in question is private land and not forest
       land as alleged by the defendants. Accordingly, learned Executive
       Magistrate passed final order declaring possession of the plaintiff over the
       suit land by his order dated 20.4.1992. The order passed by the Executive
       Magistrate was challenged by defendants before the learned Sessions
       Judge, Kamrup vide Criminal Revision No. 85 of 1992. The learned
       Sessions Judge admitted the revision petition and stayed the order dated
       20.4.1992    passed    by    the  learned   Executive    Magistrate.  Taking
       opportunity of the stay order, the defendants shifted and removed all the
       timbers of the plaintiff to their central depot situated at Agethia.
       Eventually, the second criminal revision preferred at the instance of the
       defendants were also dismissed on 25.1.1993. Thereafter, the plaintiff
       demanded to the defendants to return the timbers and the firewood.
       Defendant No. 3 transmitted the request of the plaintiff to defendant No.
RFA No.21 of 2008                                             Page 5 of 29

       4 asking him to return the timbers and the firewood and defendant No. 4
       on turn relayed the request to defendant No. 5 vide letter dated
       19.7.1993 who ultimately asked the plaintiff to make a deposit of
       Rs.59,861/- being the expenditure incurred in          felling , logging and
       dragging of the timbers from the site of the plaintiff. Plaintiff made the
       deposit on 8.8.1993 but even thereafter, the defendants released only
       50.337 cubic meter of timber to the plaintiff on four dates namely,
       26.8.1993, 27.8.1993, 2.9.1993 and 20.10.1993 out of total entitlement
       of the plaintiff to the tune 4173 cubic meters of timbers. The defendants
       did not return the 40 trucks of firewood which have been seized and
       taken away from the land of the plaintiff. Compelled under such
       circumstance, plaintiff approached this court vide Civil Rule No. 2493 of
       1994 praying for necessary direction. This court by order dated 9.8.1996
       disposed of the writ petition directing the plaintiff to submit a
       representation before the defendant No. 2 thereby claiming release of the
       balance quantum of the timber within 15 days from the date of the order
       and defendant no. 2 was directed to complete the enquiry by himself
       within two months thereafter affording opportunity of hearing to the
       plaintiff. Plaintiff submitted the representation before the defendant No.2
       who instead of making any enquiry himself appointed defendant No. 3 to
       take the enquiry. Defendant No. 3, however, without making any enquiry
       and without giving any opportunity of hearing to the plaintiff submitted a
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 6 of 29

       report on 17.2.1997 to the defendant No. 2 saying that plaintiff was
       entitled to a further quantum of timber to the extent of 4.592           cubic
       meter out of 367 cubic meter claimed by plaintiff. Defendant No. 3 did
       not say a word about the 40 trucks of firewood taken from the aforesaid
       land. This report was communicated to the plaintiff on 31.7.1997 and this
       time plaintiff could realize that her title over the seized property has come
       under cloud. Though late, plaintiff instituted money suit referred to above
       claiming Rs. 44,95,025/- towards cost of 367m of sal timber which is
       equal to 12,845 Cft. @ 350/- per Cft., Rs. 6,40,000 towards the price of
       40 trucks of firewood 16,000/- per truck. Thus, a money decree has been
       prayed for by the plaintiff for Rs.51,35, 025/-. Along with this amount
       plaintiff also made claim of Rs. 18,057/- for operation of 289.285 cubic
       meter of timber , Rs. 48,000/- for operating 40 trucks of firewood and the
       sum of Rs.59,861.00 deposited by the plaintiff on           being required by
       defendant No. 3 as a cost of operation and dragging of the timbers from
       her land. Thus, the total claim of the plaintiff is of Rs. 52,60,943/- along
       with interest @ 18 % per annum from the date of institution of the suit
       till realization.
       3.          On being summoned, defendants appeared and submitted joint
       written statement cum counter claim. Apart from taking the usual plea of
       lack of cause of action, erroneous valuation, bar of limitation etc., the
RFA No.21 of 2008                                               Page 7 of 29

       defendants also took the plea that the suit land is not identifiable.
       According to the defendants, land covered by dag No. 146/147/148 did
       not belong to the plaintiff. Rather land under dag No. 147/148 was
       settled with one Kasim Uddin         and that the suit land belongs to the
       category of Athalotia Ahutoli and so there is no question of growing sal
       trees on it. According to the defendants, sal trees take minimum 120
       years to grow to its normal size on attaining maturity and there is legal
       bar in acquiring the land by plaintiff. Defendants claimed that the plaintiff
       is not a settlement holder of the aforesaid dags of land and she being a
       non-tribal was not entitled to own and possess the aforesaid land which
       fall in a tribal belt. According to the defendants, on 22.5.1991, there was
       a cyclone in the area but the statements made in para-2 of the plaint that
       plaintiff trees were uprooted by his men is not correct. Similarly, on the
       other hand, statements made in paragraphs- 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the
       plaint has been out rightly denied by defendants. In para-14 of the
       written statement, however, defendants admitted that defendant No. 5
       seized timber found in coup No.61 and marked them properly and kept
       the same in the safe custody of the forest department to avoid theft and
       to protect the logs from fire etc. The defendants did not seize but kept
       the same in the government land as alleged by plaintiff. However, the
       fact as to disposal of the criminal revision No. 85 of 1992 and deposit of
       Rs.59, 861/- by the plaintiff pursuant to the direction of defendant No. 5
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 8 of 29

       have not been specifically denied by defendants but the same has been
       described to be matter of records thereby putting the plaintiff to strictest
       proof. Similarly, statements made in para 10 in regard to release of
       50.337 cubic timber to the plaintiff out of total quantity of 417 cubic
       meter and failure on the part of the defendants to release 40 trucks of
       firewood have been denied by defendants but the statements in regard to
       institution of Civil Rule 2493 of 1994 and disposal thereof by order dated
       9.8.1996 directing the plaintiff to submit representation etc. have not
       been denied but has been described to be matter of records thereby
       putting plaintiff to strictest proof. However, defendants claimed that
       pursuant to the order passed by the High Court , defendant No. 2 took
       necessary    action    and   held  enquiry     through  one   Mr.   SK  Sen,
       IFS,Conservator of Forest and thereupon released 4.592 cubic meter of
       timber out of     176.417 cubic meter operated by the Forest department.
       According to the defendants, they released 172.80 cubic meter of timber
       prior to release of 4.592 cubic meter. The defendants denied that no
       opportunity of hearing was given to the plaintiff before holding enquiry .
       According to the defendants , because of the cyclone on 22.5.1991 140 of
       sal trees have been uprooted inside the Moman Reserve Forest and in
       addition to the same , plaintiff herself fell another 74 numbers of standing
       sal trees. The 110 sal trees uprooted during the cyclone were duly
       marked by Forest Department and 307 number of logs for 104.249 was
RFA No.21 of 2008                                             Page 9 of 29

       marked. The 74 sal trees felled by the plaintiff was also seized and thus
       there was a total of 216 logs measuring 176.419 cubic meter.            The
       market value of which was Rs.18,49,858.50/- . All these trees belonging
       to coup No.61 belonging to the defendants. The defendants denied that
       plaintiff had invested an amount of Rs.48,000/- for operation of the
       timber and or deposit Rs. 59,861 as claimed by plaintiff. Defendants
       further stated that Dag No. 146 mentioned in the plaint is the sarkari land
       as per land records and plaintiff cannot claim all trees. The uprooted
       trees in cyclone were really the trees of Moman Reserve Forest belonging
       to the Government and this is why plaintiff was liable to make payment of
       Rs.18,49,858/- to the defendants. Defendants, therefore, made a counter
       claim for the aforesaid amount alongwith the written statement filed by
       them.
       4.         Plaintiff submitted written statement against the counter claim
       and contested the plea of the defendants that land covered by Dag
       No.147/148 are Athalotia Ahutoli. Plaintiff claimed that even if there is a
       local inspection, standing sal trees will be found on the land. Be it
       mentioned here that after submission of the written statement , plaintiff
       filed an application under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure
       praying for amendment of the plaint and thereby deleted dag No. 146
RFA No.21 of 2008                                          Page 10 of 29

       from the schedule of the plaint and this is how the claim of the plaintiff
       remained confined to Dag No. 147/148 only.
      5.   On the basis of the rival contentions of the parties, the learned trial
      court framed the following ten issues and allowed the parties to prove
      their respective case:
               (i)    Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?
               (ii)    Whether the suit is barred by law of limitation?
               (iii)  Whether the plaintiff is the absolute owner and possessor
                      of a plot of land measuring 12 bighas 17 lechas, covered
                      by Dag No.146, 147 and 148 of K.P. Patta No.30 of village
                      Pakharapara under Boko Mouza in the district of Kamrup,
                      Assam?
               (iv)   Whether the defendants took away the sal trees from the
                      aforesaid land which were uprooted and broken in the
                      cyclone occurred on 22/5/2001?
               (v)    Whether the plaintiff     is entitled to get a decree for
                      realization of Rs.52,60,943/- against the defendants with
                      interest @ 18% per annum from the date of filing the suit?
               (vi)   Whether the plaintiff is entitled to any other relief or reliefs
                      which are entitled the law and equity?
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 11 of 29

               (vii)    Whether the defendants have got any cause of action for
                        the counter claim?
               (viii)   Whether the counter claim is barred by the law of
                        limitation?
               (ix)     Whether the plaintiff realized 176.177 cubic meter timbers
                        valued at Rs.18,49,858,50 by misleading the defendants?
               (x)      Whether the defendants are entitled to get any decree on
                        the counter claim?
       6.    Plaintiff examined eight witnesses including constituted Attorney as
      PW-1 and did not come to the witness box herself.
      7.     Defendants examined only one witness. Both the sides adduced
      documents in their favour.
      8.     The learned trial court took up Issues No. 1, 2, 7 and 8 for deciding
      together and held all the Issues in favour of the plaintiff holding that the
      suit is maintainable , that it is not barred by limitationetc. However, the
      learned trial court found that the counter claim has a cause of action and
      that it was filed within the period of limitation.
      9.        Coming to Issue No. 3 as to right, title and interest of the plaintiff
      over the Dag No. -146/147, the learned trial court considered the evidence
      adduced by PW-1 who brought on record the document of title and
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 12 of 29

      mutation of the plaintiff. The learned trial court noticed that by Exhibit-2 ,
      registered sale deed No. 582 dated 8.3.1988, plaintiff purchased the plot
      of land from original owner and thereafter by Exhbiti-3 , got her name
      duly mutated in the records of rights. By Exhibit-4 series, plaintiff paid
      land revenue and even PW-8 Lat Mandal of Boko Circle supported the
      claim of the plaintiff in regard to title and possession. Exhibit-6 is the
      report submitted by the Circle Officer and relied on by PW-8 in course of
      his deposition to show that land measuring 12 Bighas 2 Katha 17 lechas
      covered by Dag No.147/148 of K.P.Patta No. 30 stood in the name of the
      plaintiff. Even PW-8 Lat Mandal deposed that K.P. Patta No.30 includes
      dag No. 147/148. The learned court noticed that by an amendment of the
      plaint, claim of the plaintiff over dag No. 146 stood deleted and thus the
      learned trial court arrived at the finding that plaintiff Minu Kumari Kalita is
      the absolute owner and possession of the land measuiring 12 Bighas 2
      Katha 17 lechas covered by dag No. 147/148 of K.P.Patta -30 of village
      Pokhoramari .
      10. The learned trial court thereafter proceeded to decide Issues No. 4, 9
      and 10 together which are in regard to taking away of sal trees and the
      quantum of the timber taken away. Deposition of PW-1 in this regard is
      that there was a cyclone on 22.5.1991 by which most of the standing sal
      trees on the suit land were uprooted or broken. Plaintiff was taking steps
RFA No.21 of 2008                                             Page 13 of 29

      for operating the said timber when defendant No. 5 alongwith some other
      men entered into land forcibly and prepared a coup and cut down all fallen
      trees and logs of timber claiming that the land belonged to reserve forest.
      Plaintiff instituted a proceeding u/s 144 Cr.P.C. in the court of learned
      Executive Magistrate whereupon the timbers and the firewood were
      attached in the aforesaid proceedings. There was an inventory of all
      seized timber and the circle office of the revenue circle made spot enquiry.
      PW-1 had claimed that taking opportunity of the said order passed by the
      learned Sessions Judge, defendant No. 5 had taken away all timbers and
      firewood to their central depo at Agathia but even after disposal of the
      case, the Divisional Forest Officer asked the plaintiff to deposit Rs.59,861/-
      towards expenditure incurred in operating and dragging the trees. The
      plaintiff deposited the amount but thereupon only 50.337 cubic meter of
      the timber was released to the plaintiff out of the total seized timber 417
      cubic meter and the remaining part was not released. As per direction of
      this High Court in Civil rule 2493 of 1994, there was enquiry and the DFO
      submitted report on 17.2.1997 in regard there to whereupon it was found
      that plaintiff was entitled to a further amount of 4.593 cubic meter of
      timber. By relying on Exhibits-1, 2, 3 and 4 adduced by plaintiff, learned
      trial court held that plaintiff has valid right, title and interest over the land
      under Dag No. 147/148. Relying on Exhibit-5(1) to Exhibit-5(4) the learned
      court came to the finding that this amount were spent by the plaintiff for
RFA No.21 of 2008                                               Page 14 of 29

      the purpose of making logs and collecting firewood from the fallen trees.
      Exhibit-6 being original case records of case No. 226 M/91 under Section
      145/146 Cr.P.C. was considered by the learned trial court. The attachment
      order vide Exhibit-6(2) and report of the circle officer vide exhibit-6(3)
      were also considered by the trial court. Having gone through the original
      records of    Criminal Revision No.109 of 1992 vide Exhibit-7 and case
      records of Criminal Revision No. 85 of 1992 vide Exhibit-8, the learned trial
      court held that timbers as claimed by the plaintiff was seized and taken
      into custody by defendants. Exhibit-9 is the receipt No. 78 evidencing
      deposit of Rs.59,861/- by the plaintiff on being demanded by the
      defendants as cost incurred in cutting and dragging the timbers from the
      Dag No. 147/148. Exhibit-10 is the certified copy of the order dated
      9.8.1996 passed by this High Court in Civil Rule No.2493 of 1994 whereby
      plaintiff was directed to file representation before the authority . Exhibit-
      12, 13 and 14 are the registration receipt regarding service of notice on
      the defendants.
      11.      PW-2 was examined by plaintiff to prove that after the trees had
      fallen due to cyclone on 22.5.1991, this witness was contacted by plaintiff
      for selling the fallen tree. He came to the suit land with a view to
      purchasing the same and so witnessed that there were sal trees on the
      land belonging to the plaintiff. Similarly, PW-3 also deposed to have visited
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 15 of 29

      the suit land for the same purpose i.e. for the purpose of purchasing
      firewood. On the other hand, Pw-4, 5 and 6 were the local persons
      examined by the plaintiff to prove that they were engaged by plaintiff on
      payment of money to cut the fallen trees, to prepare logs and to make
      firewood out of the fallen trees. All these witnesses were duly cross-
      examined by defendants. PW-7 is the police officer who deposed that on
      30.7.1992, he was the officer-in-charge of Boko Police Station and in
      compliance of an order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Kamrup in
      Criminal Revision No.85 of 1992, he deputed S.I. Subharna Barua to hold
      an enquiry. He brought Exhibit-8 as order of the learned Sessions Court in
      which Exhibit-8(4) is the signature of the S.I. , Exhibit-8(6) is the report
      submitted by Subharna Barua. PW-8 , the Lat Mandal deposed on the
      same breath in support of the plaintiff saying that disputed land measuring
      12 bighas 2 Katha 17 lechas covered by the aforesaid dag stood in the
      name of the plaintiff. The learned trial court also considered the sole
      evidence of the defendants’ side adduced by defendant No. 1. Defendant
      No. 1 is the Deputy Conservator of Forest who deposed that land covered
      by Dag No. 147/148 belong to the category of Athalotia Ahutoli and that
      sal trees cannot grow on such land. He proved report Exhibit-A dated
      19.1.2001 along with trace map Exhibit-A(1)          and Exhibit-A(3) joint
      enquiry report dated 14.2.2001. He proved order passed under Section-
      145 Cr.P.C. vide Exhibit-B and Judgment of the writ petition in WP © No.
RFA No.21 of 2008                                           Page 16 of 29

      202 /1995 vide Exhibit-C. Exhibit-D is the register of coup No. W.F.C. /61
      of 91-92 and according to him by misleading the defendants, the plaintiff
      managed to get 176.417 cubic meter from the defendants , the value of
      which is Rs. 18,49,858.50/- and the plaintiff is liable to refund the said
      amount to the defendants. The learned trial court noticed the cross
      examination of the DW-1 wherein he admitted that forest land does not
      have any dag number whereas the suit is measured by Dag No.147/148.
      He also noticed the order of the learned Sessions Judge in the Criminal
      Revision leading to the inventory of 417 cubic meter of timber cut by the
      plaintiff. The learned trial court held that entire stock of the timber were
      taken into central depot by the defendants for safe custody without
      permission of the court. The objection raised by the defendants that the
      land did not contain any standing trees was on the basis of the averment
      made in the sale deed Exhibit-2. The learned trial court arrived at the view
      that the plaintiff had purchased the land alongwith Zeerath and so the
      objection was not found acceptable. Considering the Exhibit-A report
      dated 19.1.2001 given by the circle officer of the Revenue Circle , the
      learned trial court held that plaintiff is the pattadar of land measuring of
      12 Bigha 2 Katha 17 lechas of land covered by Dag No. 146, 147, 148 of
      K.P.Patta No. 30 of Village-Pokhorapara under Boko Mouza. Considering
      the aforesaid evidence and the circumstances, the trial court held that it is
      quite logical to hold that evidence given by the plaintiff is corroborated by
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 17 of 29

      the plaintiff’s witness as well as the sole defence witness. This is because
      DW-1 admitted to have seized the sal trees uprooted and broken in
      cyclone on 22.5.1991 and thus Issues No. 1, 4, 9 and 10 were decided in
      favour of the plaintiff. Of course, in this finding the learned trial court did
      not make any discussion as to how he arrived at the quantum of the
      timbers or of firewood made from the trees fallen in cyclone dated
      22.5.1991 or the value there of. Ultimately, while deciding Issues No. 5
      and 6 as to entitlement of the plaintiff for getting a decree as prayed for,
      the learned trial court presumed that 367 cubic meter of sal trees and 40
      trucks of firewood were taken away by defendants from the land of the
      plaintiff and that value of the said timber @ 350 Cft was Rs. 44, 95, 025/-
      and that of 40 trucks of firewood @ Rs. 16,000/- per truck was to the tune
      of Rs.6,40,000/-. According to the learned court, the sole defence witness
      admitted the quantum of the timber taken from the land of the plaintiff at
      the relevant time and according to him, police made inventory of 417
      cubic meters of timbers including 176 timbers of the Forest Department
      and the entire stock was taken to the Central Depot by Forest official for
      safe custody. The learned trial court thereafter noted the claim of
      defendant in para-10 of the counter claim, that there was 100 cubic meter
      of firewood and not 40 trucks as claimed by the plaintiff. However,
      learned trial court held that 100 cubic meter was the quantum of the
      firewood taken by the defendants from the broken sal trees. Considering
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 18 of 29

      the inventory Exhibit-6(3), learned trial court held that there were 568
      pieces of sal tress of different sizes. According to the plaintiff 50.337 cubic
      meter out of total 417 cubic meter were released to him by Forest
      department and thus she is entitled to 357 cubic meter of timber from the
      defendants, the value of this amount was calculated on the basis of the
      claim of the plaintiff i.e. Rs.12,248 per cubic meter and thereupon the
      total value of Rs. 44,95,025/-was arrived at. Coming to the claim of
      firewood, learned trial court noticed that defendants did not give any
      calculation in this regard and so calculation given by the plaintiff should be
      accepted and accordingly it was accepted. This in addition to Rs.59,861/-
      deposited by the plaintiff to the defendants was also taken into
      consideration apart from the value of the timber and thus the learned trial
      court passed a decree for Rs.51,94,886/-excluding the claim of the plaintiff
      in regard to expenditure made in cutting and preparing logs from the
      fallen trees. Thus, suit of the plaintiff stood decreed for Rs.51,94,886/-
      vide Judgment dated 11.2.2008 and it is this judgment which has been
      challenged in the present appeal.
      12.    I have heard Mr. G Sharma, learned Government Advocate for the
      appellants and Mr. SS Dey, learned senior Advocate assisted by Ms. N
      Kalita and Ms. S Deka for the sole respondents. I have perused the
      pleadings of the parties and evidence adduced by them. The appeal came
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 19 of 29

        up for hearing on 12.8.2015 but it could not be completed and so it has
        been heard again on 14. 8. 2015 and today i.e. on 18.8.2015.
13.     The sole point for determination in this appeal will be as follows:
                         “Whether the plaintiff is entitled to Rs.51,94,886/- as
                        decreed by the learned trial court and if not what relief the
                        plaintiff is entitled to ?”.
14.     Mr. G Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant would argue that the
learned trial court committed error in making assessment of the timber taken by
the defendants from the plaintiff . In so doing, the learned trial court relied on
mere conjecture and surmises as there is no material on records to arrive at the
finding as to what amount of timber was taken by defendants from the custody
of the plaintiff. According to Mr. Sharma, the finding of the trial court that
plaintiff is the owner in possession of the land is also not correct. The plaintiff did
not institute any suit for declaration of her right, title and interest over the suit
land and so in the absence of the prayer to that effect, it is not possible to arrive
at a finding that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief whatsoever against the claim
made by him. Mr. Sharma further argues that if it is the case of the plaintiff that
the defendants had forcefully taken away the property of the plaintiff in that
event the plaintiff would have been at liberty to institute an appropriate
proceeding in the court of law to get the offender punished. The same not
RFA No.21 of 2008                                              Page 20 of 29

having been done, it is to be presumed that the defendants did never take away
the properties of the plaintiff by force.
15. Per contra, Mr. SS Dey, learned senior counsel appearing for the sole
respondent/plaintiff would argue that the parties went to trial knowing respective
cases of each other. Both the parties led evidence knowing that the crux of the
issues is based on the claim of title over the land covering Dag No.147/148 of
K.P.Patta No. 30 of Village-Pokhorapara. Plaintiff exhibited documents of
registered sale deed being Exhibit-2 and the certified copy of the revenue records
being Exhibit-3 in support of her claim of title to the land covered by the
aforesaid dags and these Exhibits were taken into evidence without any
objection. The defendants duly cross-examined all the witnesses including the
officers who are examined like Lat Mandal, Police officers and no one objected to
admittance of those exhibits into record. Once the documents of title were duly
exhibited and the report of the Revenue officer was brought to the notice of the
learned trial court, it proceeded to decide as to whether plaintiff had any right,
title and interest over the Dag No.147/148 and thereupon arrived at the finding
that the plaintiff purchased the land by Exhibit-2 and only thereafter, her name
was duly mutated in the records of rights vide Exhibit-2 and thus the plaintiff has
right, title and possession over the suit land. The learned trial court did not
commit any error in arriving at the finding that the plaintiff is the holder of the
title of the land holder. There is nothing on record to arrive at different finding
RFA No.21 of 2008                                           Page 21 of 29

and thus fining of the trial court does not warrant any interference, Mr. Dey,
argued. Coming to the objection raised by Mr. Sharma that the plaintiff did not
take any step for getting the defendants punished in accordance with law for
their act of trespassing into the suit land, Mr. Dey would argue that the plaintiff
was never interested for getting any public officers punished. She was an ailing
lady and interested to get her property back or for compensation or price of
timbers unlawfully taken away by the defendants . A proceeding under Section
144 Cr.P.C. was initiated at the instance of the plaintiff i.e. within a period of
about one month and once the law enforcing machinery was set in motion there
was no further necessity of instituting cases against the offenders. The learned
Magistrate asked for a report from the police which was eventually produced and
thereupon the learned Executive Magistrate arrived at the finding that the
plaintiff was the lawful possessor of the land at the relevant time. Even after
such declaration of possession was made by the Executive Magistrate, the
defendants preferred Criminal Revision before the learned Sessions Judge which
did not yield any result. This chronology of events only go to show that plaintiff
was all along agile and ready to get her property back and that the law enforcing
authorities including police were very much aware that there was an allegation of
trespass into the private land of the plaintiff. Since in view of the bonafide
assertion of title by the defendants claiming the suit land to be forest land,
perhaps there would have been no criminal proceeding against public officers in
view of provision u/s 197 Cr.P.C. This, therefore, cannot be taken as a ground
RFA No.21 of 2008                                          Page 22 of 29

against the plaintiff to deny her bonafide title. However, coming to the objection
raised by Mr. Sharma that there is no material whatsoever on record to come to
finding that there were 417 cubic meters timber seized by the plaintiff , Mr. Dey
in his usual fairness submitted that the plaintiff could have adduced better
evidence to enable the court to arrive at the finding.
16.       Pursuant to the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, there was
an inventory of all timbers of the firewood seized and taken into custody by the
Forest officer and the Range Officer doing the operation had submitted a detailed
report to the Divisional Officer in this regard. A copy of the report of the Range
Officer was also sent to Boko Police Station and the report submitted by the
Officer-in-charge was exhibited by plaintiff was exhibited as Exhibit-8 to show
that there was an inventory which resulted in discovery that certain specified
amount of timbers were seized and taken into custody by defendants from the
land of the plaintiff. From the array of events as mentioned by the witness of the
plaintiff as well as the sole witness of the defendants, it appears that as a result
of cyclone held on 22.5.1991, large number of trees in Phokomari village had
been uprooted , sal trees standing on Dag No. 147/148 also had been uprooted
to a large extent. By engaging PWs-4, 5 and 6, Plaintiff started preparing timbers
out of the fallen trees when defendant No. 5 made his entry to the scene and
took over the possession of the land as well as the timber. He thereafter
prepared the timber which according to the plaintiff amount to 417 cubic meter
apart from 40 trucks of firewood.
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 23 of 29

17.        The learned trial court has taken into consideration this aspect of the
matter. In the absence of any evidence led to the contrary it is to be seen that
plaintiff proved by pre-ponderance of probability that 417 cubic meter of timber
was seized by the defendants and the defendants could not prove that they had
handed over 176.417 cubic meter or 4.592 cubic meter of timber to the plaintiff
in any point of time. According to the plaintiff she succeeded to prove that only
50.337 cubic meter of timber was released to her. Besides by adducing Exhibit-9,
plaintiff proved deposit of Rs.59,861/- to the defendants and so suit of the
plaintiff was rightly decreed, Mr. Dey contended.
18.       The point for determination in the appeal, therefore, is :-
                 (i) Whether plaintiff has proved by pre-ponderance of probability
                 that defendants had seized or taken over 417 cubic meter of
                 timbers from sal trees grown on Dag No.147/148 of K.P.Patta No.
                 30 of Village-Pokhorapara under Boko Mouza and what was the
                 price of this?
                 (ii) Whether plaintiff has proved the quantum of firewood seized
                 and the price thereof?
19.       Having considered the rival the contention of the learned counsel for the
parties,    it is necessary to examine as to whether plaintiff has proved the
quantum of the timbers seized by defendants from the Dag No. 147/148 referred
to above. Of course, plaintiff has succeeded to prove her right, title and interest
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 24 of 29

over Dag No. 147/148 by examining the documents of title vide Exhibit-2 and the
records of rights vide Exhibit-3. The plaintiff has also proved Exhibit-4, revenue
receipt and so there is no doubt that plaintiff has right, title and interest over
Dag No. 147/148 and that there were timber standing on the same dags. What is
left to be decided is only the quantum of the timber seized by the defendants
from Dag No. 147/148 and the price there of . From perusal of the records, it
appears that Exhibit-1 is the certificate of the Power of Attorney, Exhibit-2 is the
registered sale deed whereby plaintiff purchased the land covered by Dag
No.147/148 along with Zeerath and Exihibit-3, the certified copy of the
Jamabandi . Exhibit-2 and 3 go to show that plaintiff purchased the land on
payment of valuable consideration that she purchased not only the land but also
Zeerath i.e. standing trees there on. Exhibit-3 goes to show that plaintiff being
in possession of the land obtained mutation in the records of rights. Exhibit-4 is
the revenue paying receipt. Exhibit-5 series are the receipts given by PWs- 4 , 5
and 6 who are daily wage labourer and being men of the locality who were
engaged to cut the fallen trees to prepare logs and to separate firewood. So from
Exhibits -1 to 5, there is no indication to as to what was the number of tress
fallen due to cyclone and the quantum of the logs taken out from them. To prove
the same, plaintiff appears to have exhibited Exhibit-6 the original case records
of the 145 Cr.P.C. proceeding which contain Exhibit-6(1) preliminary order for
drawing up proceeding under Section 145/146 Cr.P.C.. Exhibit-6 (2) is the
inspection report by the police. Exhibit-6(3) on the other hand is the report of
RFA No.21 of 2008                                           Page 25 of 29

the circle officer in regard to the prima facie title and possession of the plaintiff.
So Exhibit-6 is of no help for arriving at a finding that 417 cubic meter of timber
was taken away by defendants from the land of the plaintiff. Exhibit-7 is the
original case records of Criminal Revision No.109 of 1992 but it does not appear
as to why the same is not available in the records. Exhibit-8 is the case records
of Criminal Revision No.85 of 1992. Exhibit-8(1) is the judgment passed by the
learned Sessions Judge in the said Criminal Revision whereby revision preferred
by Forest department was rejected. Exhibit-8(6) is a report submitted by the S.I.
of Police of Boko Police Station to the District Judge, Kamrup enclosing a letter
dated 20.7.1992 written by Range Forest Officer of Singra Range Boko to DFO,
Kamrup West Division . There is an indication of the said report dated 20.7.1992
that a list has been annexed showing trees standing on the periodic patta No.30
under Dag No.147/148 of the concerned village which had fallen trees owing to
cyclone. But the list annexed to the report dated 20.7.1992 is neither signed nor
authenticated. Plaintiff did not examine the Range Forest officer of Singra Range
Boko or any other officer of the Forest Department             for the purpose of
ascertaining the quantum of timbers seized by police or Forest Department. What
is admitted is that some sal trees standing on Dag No. 147/148 had been
uprooted due to cyclone and so both the plaintiff as well as the defendants had
engaged men to cut them into pieces for preparing logs and for separating the
firewood. Admittedly there was an inventory after the same was attached by
order of the learned Executive Magistrate and the inventory was submitted
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 26 of 29

before the Sessions Judge. Had the inventory report been called for from the
custody of the appropriate authority in that event the actual quantity of timber
seized by defendants from the land belonging to the plaintiff could have been
ascertained. Neither the person making the inventory nor the person making the
seizure have been examined in the present case. The fact that record could have
been proved by adducing primary evidence under section 59 of the Evidence Act,
the plaintiff could have obtained certified copy of the records or could have called
for original records but the same not having been done, the finding arrived at by
the learned trial court that 417 cubic meter of timber was seized by defendants
and the value there of was Rs.44,95,025/- cannot be said to have been proved.
Under such circumstance, findings of the learned trial court as to right, title and
interest of the plaintiff over Dag No. 147/148 of K.P.Patta No. 30 of Village-
Pokhorapara under Boko Mouza is hereby upheld but the finding of the trial court
that the defendants had taken away 417 cubic meter of timber from the Dag
No.147/148 and that plaintiff is entitled 367 cubic meter of timber or that price of
the timber is Rs. 44,95,025/- has not been proved in accordance with law. It is
not possible for the appellate court as well from perusal of the records to arrive
at the finding that 417 cubic meter of timbers were seized by defendants or that
such amount of timbers were not seized by defendants. Since the evidence is
insufficient on this point, it is not possible on the part of the appellate court to
decide either the quantum of the timbers seized or the price of the said timbers
and firewood. Under such circumstance, only alternative left to the court is to
RFA No.21 of 2008                                            Page 27 of 29

take recourse under Order XLI Rule 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure and to
frame issue and thereupon to remand the matter to the trial court for decision
afresh in accordance with law. Accordingly, the impugned judgment and decree
in so far as it relates to finding as to quantum of the timbers seized and
entitlement of the plaintiff against such seizure is hereby set aside and the
matter is remanded back to the trial court for deciding the following issues:
                       (i) Whether defendants had seized or taken over 417 cubic
                       meter of timber from sal trees from the land covered by
                       Dag No.147/148 of of K.P.Patta No. 30 of Village-
                       Pokhorapara under Boko Mouza ? If not what was the
                       quantum of timber so possessed and taken away by the
                       defendants and in any event that what would be the price
                       for such timber?
                       (ii) What should be the quantum of compensation payable
                       to the plaintiff by defendants”
                       (iii) What was the quantum of firewood seized, or taken
                       away by the defendants and the price there of ?
20.    It is ordered that the learned trial court shall decide the suit afresh as
expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of 6(six) months from the
date of receipt of the records and the parties shall co-operate with the learned
RFA No.21 of 2008                                           Page 28 of 29

court and shall appear before the trial court on 14.9.2015 to receive necessary
