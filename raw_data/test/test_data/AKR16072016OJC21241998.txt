                                                  (S & M.E.)
   PRESENT:
                   THE HON,BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
   Date of Hearing: 12.07.2016         :         Date of Judgment:16.07.2016
Dr.A.K.Rath, J.     By this writ application under Article 226 of the
   Constitution of India, the petitioner has prayed inter alia for a
   direction to the opposite parties to allow him to draw trained graduate
   scale of pay with effect from the date of acquiring B.Ed. qualification.
   2.           Case of the petitioner is that he was appointed as an
   Assistant Teacher in the trained matric post in Nimpur Sasan High
   School on 15.7.1969 by the Managing Committee of the school. The
   school in question was established in the year 1969. It got recognition
   in the year 1971 and came under the fold of grant-in-aid scheme in
   the year 1974. He was adjusted against the trained intermediate post
   with effect from 24.4.1976. The post was upgraded to a trained

                                    2
graduate post. While the matter stood thus, he passed B.Ed
examination in May,1984 and the result thereof was published on
13.5.1985. After he became a trained graduate, he is entitled to get
trained graduate scale of pay as per the notification of the Government
vide letter no.XIV EDET 5/83, 5680 EYS dated 7.2.1983. Thereafter he
approached the authorities for allowing him trained graduate scale of
pay from 13.5.1985, but the same was denuded. With this factual
scenario, the writ application has been filed.
3.           Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has
been filed by opposite party no.3. It is stated that the Managing
Committee of Nimapur Sasan High School appointed the petitioner as
an Assistant Teacher, 5th Trained Graduate without observing the
principles of Yardstick, 1981 prescribed by the Government. Only one
science graduate is working in the school. The yardstick of the year
1981, which came into force with effect from 1.6.1983, prescribed that
in the aided high schools there shall be four trained graduate teachers
excluding the headmaster. Amongst those four trained graduate
teachers, two must be trained arts graduate and two must be science
graduate. From those two science graduates, one must be of P.C.M.
group and another must be from C.B.Z. group. The post against which
the present petitioner was continuing is the 5th post which is
exclusively meant for a science graduate having C.B.Z combination.
The same is earmarked for the trained graduate teacher having C.B.Z.
group of subject.     The petitioner, being a B.A. B.Ed., cannot be
accommodated against such post and as such no approval can be
granted.
4.           An identical question came up for consideration before
this Court in the case of Madhab Chandra Podh Vrs. State of Orissa
and 4 others, 1998 (II) OLR-334. The petitioner was appointed against

                                         3
an I.A.C.T. post on 22.2.1973 in Sachidananda High School in the
district of Bolangir. The post he was holding was upgraded with effect
from 28.1.1975 to a trained graduate post. He continued in that post
in the scale of pay of I.A.C.T. Teacher as he was a graduate. In
December, 1983 he became a trained graduate. In accordance with the
decision of the Government in its letter No.XIV EDET 5/83, 5680 EYS
dated    7.2.1983    addressed       to   the    Deputy      Director    of  Public
Instructions, Orissa, he was entitled to the trained graduate scale of
pay. The grievance of the petitioner was that though he was continuing
against a trained graduate post, yet he was refused to be granted the
trained graduate scale of pay since the date of his acquiring such
qualification.
5.            Relying on the letter No.XIV EDET 5/83, 5680 EYS dated
7.2.1983 addressed to the Deputy Director of Public Instructions,
Orissa, the State of Orissa justified its action. This Court held thus:-
                            “In the decision of the Government communicated
                    to the Deputy Director of Public Instructions on 7.2.1983
                    it was decided that there is no bar to allow trained scale
                    of pay to all untrained graduate appointed against a
                    trained graduate post as soon as he acquires training
                    qualification. This decision was being taken by the
                    Government in the background of the fact as to whether
                    there was any necessity to amend the Rule 8(2)(b) of the
                    Orissa Education (Recruitment and Conditions of Service
                    of Teachers and Members of the Staff of Aided
                    Educational Institutions) Rules, 1974 (hereinafter
                    referred to as the '1974 Rules'). The decision was that
                    there was no need for amendment of the Rule to achieve
                    the purpose of granting Trained Graduate Scale of pay to
                    a teacher who had been appointed against a Trained
                    Graduate Post but was being paid a lesser scale of pay
                    because of his not having the trained qualification. This
                    was a general decision applicable to all such teachers
                    and undoubtedly since the petitioner was holding the
                    appointment against the Trained Graduate post since
                    1975, he became entitled to the Trained Graduate Scale
                    on his acquiring the trained qualification. Such right of
                    the petitioner is not to be defeated only because of the
                    revised yardstick. All that the revised yardstick purported

                                   4
             to say was that in a school there must be two Trained
             Science Graduate Teachers and two Trained Arts
             Graduate Teachers besides the Headmaster. It did never
             say that the teacher who has become entitled to the
             Trained Graduate scale of pay would be deprived of the
             same. Rule 8(2)(b) of the 1974 Rules was the rule which
             deals with promotion of in service teachers in a school
             providing that the managing committee can, with the
             prior approval of the Government promote a teacher to a
             post carrying higher scale of pay if there is a vacancy.
             The decision was being taken in that background that
             the prior approval of the Government would not be
             necessary in view of the fact that the Government had no
             objection to the grant of higher scale of pay to the
             teachers who had acquired trained qualification while
             holding their appointments against the Trained Graduate
             Posts. If as a result of a teacher acquiring trained
             qualification there was a surfeit of Trained Arts Graduate
             Teachers or the Trained Science Graduate Teachers in
             the school, as the case may be, the obvious thing to be
             done is to transfer the required Teachers to some other
             institutions and in their place get the teachers as are
             necessary for the purposes of the school. It is for such
             reason that the petitioner must succeed to the
             declaration that he is entitled to be granted the Trained
             Graduate scale of pay from December 1983 and be
             placed in the cadre of Trained Graduate Teachers from
             that date. The authorities are free to transfer the
             petitioner, if the necessity so arises, in accordance with
             the requirement of the yardstick as in Annexure-C. The
             arrear dues of the petitioner in the Trained Graduate
             scale of pay be paid to him within three months from the
             date of receipt of the writ from this Court.”
6.           The ratio of Madhab Chandra Podh (supra) applies
with full force to the facts and circumstances of the present
case.
7.           The next question that arises for consideration of
this Court whether the petitioner is entitled to arrear salary with
effect from he acquired B.Ed. qualification. In the case of Union
of India and others Vrs. Tarsem Singh, (2008) 8 Supreme Court
Cases 648, the apex Court in paragraph-7 of the report held
thus:-

                                        5
                   “7.     To summarise, normally, a belated service related
                   claim will be rejected on the ground of delay and laches
                   (where remedy is sought by filing a writ petition) or
                   limitation (where remedy is sought by an application to
                   the Administrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions to the
                   said rule is cases relating to a continuing wrong. Where a
                   service related claim is based on a continuing wrong,
                   relief can be granted even if there is a long delay in
                   seeking remedy, with reference to the date on which the
                   continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing wrong
                   creates a continuing source of injury. But there is an
                   exception to the exception. If the grievance is in respect
                   of any order or administrative decision which related to
                   or affected several others also, and if the re-opening of
                   the issue would affect the settled rights of third parties,
                   then the claim will not be entertained. For example, if the
                   issue relates to payment or re-fixation of pay or pension,
                   relief may be granted in spite of delay as it does not affect
                   the rights of third parties. But if the claim involved issues
                   relating to seniority or promotion etc., affecting others,
                   delay would render the claim stale and doctrine of
                   laches/limitation will be applied. In so far as the
                   consequential relief of recovery of arrears for a past
                   period is concerned, the principles relating to
                   recurring/successive      wrongs      will    apply.     As a
                   consequence, High Courts will restrict the consequential
                   relief relating to arrears normally to a period of three
                   years prior to the date of filing of the writ petition.”
8.           In view of the authoritative pronouncement of the apex
Court in the case of Tarsem Singh (supra), the petitioner is entitled to
arrear salary for a period of three years prior to the date of filing of the
writ application.
9.           The inescapable conclusion is that the petitioner is
entitled to trained graduate scale of pay with effect from the date he
acquired B.Ed. qualification. With regard to the arrear salary, the
same shall be calculated and paid to the petitioner for a period of three
years prior to the filing of the writ application. Since the petitioner has
retired from service, his pensionary benefits shall be calculated
accordingly. The entire exercise shall be completed within a period of
six months. The writ application is allowed. No costs.

10.              Before parting with the case, this Court is of the view that
the claim of the petitioner was denuded on jejune grounds. The
immortal words of Chief Justice Chagla in the case of Firm Kaluram
Sitaram Vrs. The Dominion of India, AIR 1954 Bombay 50, that when
the State deals with a citizen it should not ordinarily rely on
technicalities, and if the State is satisfied that the case of the citizen is
a just one, even though legal defences may be open to it, it must act,
as has been said by eminent judges, as an honest person.
