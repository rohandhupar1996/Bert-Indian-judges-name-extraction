          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Date of hearing and judgment : 10.10.2017
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. N. Prasad, J.        This writ petition is against the order dated 10.10.2005 passed
          by the opposite party no.2-Executive Officer, Baripada Municipality whereby
          and whereunder the petitioner has been allotted a shop room in the 1st floor
          of the shopping complex in question while the case of the petitioner is that in

                                         2
initial process of selection, she has been allotted a shop room situated in the
ground floor of the shopping complex.
2.            The ground raised by the petitioner in assailing the subsequent
decision of the authority in allotting the shop room in the 1st floor of the
shopping complex is that on earlier occasion by virtue of due process having
been followed by the Selecting Body, she has been allotted a shop room in
the ground floor. She has deposited the required money and also ready to
deposit the excess amount, if she would have been allotted a shop room in
the ground floor in the subsequent selection process. But without taking
into consideration this aspect of the matter, the earlier decision taken by the
Selecting Body, has been reversed by the subsequent Selecting Body that to
without any rhyme and reason. Hence, the decision is highly arbitrary and
illegal. The further ground taken by the petitioner is that when the Selecting
Body, in course of his tenure, has taken a decision, the subsequent Selecting
Body cannot reverse the decision already taken that to which is detrimental
to the interest of the petitioner.
3.            The Baripada Municipality has appeared and filed counter
affidavit inter alia stating therein that there is no illegality in the allotment of
a shop room in favour of the petitioner vide order dated 10.10.2005
(Annexure-2) in the 1st floor instead of allotting the same as proposed earlier
in the market complex in the ground floor because of the reason that the
decision taken for allotment of shop rooms vide Resolution dated 28.06.2002
of the Space Committee of erstwhile Baripada Municipal Council was never

                                        3
been acted upon and no allotment order was issued to anyone including the
petitioner as per the said resolution.
             Further contention is that the said Municipal Council was
dissolved on expiry of its term on 16.7.2002.       Subsequently during the
interim period prior to election, the Collector and District Magistrate,
Mayurbhanj remained in the charge of the administrator, who has passed
the order to distribute the shop rooms by way of auction. But after taking
over the charge by the newly elected/constituted Council and Chairperson of
Baripada Municipality on 1.10.2003, the new Space Committee cancelled the
previous Resolution of the previous Council which was never been
implemented on the ground that the decision of the previous Council for
distribution and allotment of shop rooms was taken hurriedly just before
expiry of its terms and much before the completion of shopping complex
without assessing the total cost of construction which would be realized from
the allottees and also the Collector and District Magistrate, Mayurbhanj,
while remaining in charge of the Municipality, had passed adverse remarks
over the issue. Accordingly, fresh allotment was made through the lottery
vide Resolution dated 7.10.2005 and the petitioner was allotted shop room
No.1 in the 1st floor in the same location. It has been contended on the
strength of this statement that no illegality has been conducted by the
Baripada Municipality.
             Further contention is that the petitioner, who is seeking for
allotment of shop room No.9 has already been allotted in favour of Shri

                                       4
Birendra Nath Sahu, who has deposited the required amount in Municipal
funds vide M.R. No.18651 dated 21.10.2005 and has taken possession of
the said shop room prior to the order dated 25.10.2005 passed by this Court
in Misc. Case No.13066 of 2005 arising out of the instant writ petition.
4.            Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents available on record.
5.            The fact which led the petitioner to approach this Court is that
she claims to be an allottee of shop room No.9 situated in the ground floor of
the market complex and subsequently she has been allotted shop room No.1
in the 1st floor of the said market complex. Being aggrieved due to change in
the location of the shop room from ground floor to 1st floor, she is before this
Court by way of this instant writ petition.
6.            It is evident from the material available in the counter affidavit,
which has not been responded to by the petitioner, that the petitioner has
been allotted the shop room in the ground floor by the Space Committee of
the Baripada Municipal Council before the completion of the shopping
complex without assessing the total cost of construction. It is also evident
from the pleadings of the counter affidavit that the resolution was taken for
allotment of the shop rooms on 28.06.2002 while the said Council was itself
been dissolved on expiry of its term on 16.7.2002. Hence, it is very peculiar
and astonishing that the outgoing body before completion of the shopping
complex has allotted the shop room in favour of one or other by virtue of it,
the petitioner has been allotted shop room No.9 in the ground floor which

                                        5
has been depreciated by the Collector, who during the intervening period,
has become the administrator of the Baripada Municipal           Council     and
subsequently when the new body has taken the charge of the office has
rectified the irregularities by taking decision of cancelling the decision taken
by the erstwhile Council Body on 28.06.2002. The new Council Body has
also taken decision to go for fresh allotment by way of lottery and in course
thereof, the petitioner has been allotted a shop room in the 1st floor of the
market complex and the opposite party no.4, namely, Birendra Nath Sahu
has been allotted a shop being shop room No.9 in the ground floor.
7.           The petitioner has not made out a case of discrimination or
arbitrariness on the part of the authority, rather it is clear from the
pleadings and the material available on record that the decision taken by the
erstwhile Council Body on 28.06.2002 has been canceled uniformly and
thereafter a decision was taken to go for fresh allotment by way of lottery
reason being that when the resolution was taken on 28.06.2002, the market
complex was not completed and as such, the proper cost could not have
been assessed and realized from the allottees. Hence, the decision has been
taken to go for fresh selection by cancelling the decision taken by the
erstwhile Council Body.
8.           It is also contended by the opposite party-Baripada Municipality
that the resolution dated 28.06.2002 has never been given effect to meaning
thereby the possession of the shop room in question for which the petitioner
is claiming, has never been given possession in her favour.

                                          6
9.             Keeping these facts into consideration and reason mentioned in
the counter affidavit, in which, specific stand is that the decision of the
allotment has been taken while the shopping complex was under
construction, the outgoing body, who expiry of its term on 16.7.2002, has
taken a decision on 28.06.2002, led to take a fresh decision and accordingly,
the said has adopted the fair and transparent process by way of lottery
system.
10.            Hence, according to the considered view of this Court, there is
no illegality in the decision taken by the authority.
               Moreover the allotment of shop room is not a fundamental right
of the petitioner unless any arbitrariness or pick and choose policy would
have been pointed out. But nothing to that effect has been pleaded.
               In view of these facts, since the authorities have chosen fair and
transparent allotment system, in which, the petitioner has been allotted the
shop room in the 1st floor of the market complex. Hence, there is no illegality
in the decision taken by the authority.
11.            In view thereof, I find no reason to interfere with the decision of
the authority.
               Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.
                                              ……...………………
                                               S.N. Prasad, J.
