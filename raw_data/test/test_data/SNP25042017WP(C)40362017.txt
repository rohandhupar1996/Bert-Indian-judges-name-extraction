           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. N. Prasad, J.          This writ petition is under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of
           India wherein the order dtd.9th February, 2017 passed by the Central
           Administrative Tribunal, Cuttack Bench, Cuttack in O.A. No.835 of 2016 is under
           challenge whereby and where under the prayer of the petitioner to stay the
           disciplinary proceeding in course of pendency of criminal case before the CBI
           Court, has been refused to be granted.
           2.             The brief facts of the case in hand is that the father of the petitioner,
           namely, Bishnu Charan Das was an employee in the Railways and was serving as

                                           2
a Train Ticket Inspector, being posted at Khurda Road division of East Coast
Railway, while in service he died on 19.5.2003 leaving           behind    him   his
widow Swarnalata and the present petitioner as his legal heirs.
              The petitioner being the legal heir, has made application for
appointment on compassionate ground and was appointed as Helper in East Coast
Railways after following due procedure of selection vide order dtd.05.07.2005.
              While the petitioner was working, an F.I.R. was instituted by the
authorities of the East Coast Railways against the petitioner before the CBI,
Bhubaneswar for getting the appointment by suppressing the material fact
declaring himself as son of Late Bishnu Charan Das. The authorities have initiated
a departmental proceeding against him under the provision of Railway Servant
(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968. The petitioner has made representation
before the authorities to stay the further proceeding of the disciplinary proceeding
in course of pendency of the criminal case, when his grievance was not acceded to,
he has approached the Tribunal for stay of the departmental proceeding mainly on
the ground that if the departmental proceeding will not be stayed the entire
defence which he will take in the criminal case will be disclosed at this juncture
and as such he will be prejudiced in the criminal case. But the Tribunal has
rejected the contention of the petitioner and allowed the departmental proceeding
to continue which is under challenge in this writ petition.
3.            Learned counsel appearing for the East Coast Railways has
vehemently opposed the submission of the petitioner by submitting that there is
no bar in simultaneous proceeding of the departmental proceeding as well as the

                                           3
criminal proceeding which has already been settled by the Hon’ble Apex Court in
catena of decisions.
              He further submits that since the departmental proceeding and the
criminal proceeding concern to different fields, as such there is no embargo in
continuing with the departmental proceeding as well as the criminal proceeding,
the Tribunal, after taking into consideration this aspect of the matter, has rejected
the plea of the petitioner while dismissing the original application, hence there is
no infirmity in the order.
4.            We have heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the
documents available on record including the order passed by the learned Central
Administrative Tribunal.
              We, before proceeding with the facts of the instant case, have though
it proper to deal with the settle proposition in the matter of simultaneous
continuation of departmental proceeding vis-à-vis criminal proceeding.
              The Hon’ble Apex Court has dealt with this issue so many times, i.e.
in the case of Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation Vrs. Md.
Yousuf Miya, reported in 1997(2) SCC 699 wherein Hon’ble Apex Court has been
pleased to make difference between the purpose of departmental enquiry and
criminal trial while holding therein it has been laid down that purposes of
departmental enquiry and the prosecution are two different and distinct aspects.
The criminal prosecution is launched for an offence in violation of duty, the
offender owes to the society or for breach of which law has provided that the

                                           4
offender shall make satisfaction to the public so crime is an act of commission in
violation of law or omission of public duty.
               The departmental enquiry is to maintain discipline in service and
efficiency of public service. It would, therefore, be expedient that the disciplinary
proceedings are conducted and completed as expeditiously as possible. It is not,
therefore, desirable to lay down any guideline as inflexible rules in which the
departmental proceeding may or may not be stayed pending trial in criminal case
against the delinquent officer. Each case requires to be considered in the backdrop
of its own facts and circumstances.
               There would be no bar to proceed simultaneously with the
departmental proceeding and trial of a criminal case unless the charge in a
criminal trial is of grave nature involving complicated questions of fact and law.
Offence generally implies infringement of public as distinguished from mere
private right punishable under criminal law, when trial for criminal offence is
conducted it should be in accordance with the proof of offence as per the evidence
defined under the provisions of the evidence act. Converse in the case of
departmental enquiry in a departmental proceeding relates to conduct of breach of
duty of the delinquent officer who punish him for his misconduct defined under
the relevant statute / rule or law that strict standard of rule or applicability of
Evidence Act stands excluded in a settled legal position.
               The enquiry in the departmental proceeding relates to the conduct of
the delinquent officer and proof in that behalf is not as high as in an offence in
criminal charge. It is seen that invariably the departmental enquiry has to be

                                             5
conducted expeditiously so as to effectual efficiency in public administration and
the criminal trial will take its own course. The nature           of   evidence   in
criminal trial is entirely different from the departmental proceeding.
               In the former, prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable
doubt under touch stone of human conduct. The stand of proof in the
departmental proceeding is not the same as in the criminal trial. The evidence is
also on different stand point of Evidence Act. The evidence required in the
departmental enquiry is not regulated on the facts under these circumstances,
what is required to be seen is whether the departmental enquiry would seriously
prejudice the delinquent employee in his defence at the trial in a criminal case.
               It is always a question of fact to be considered in each case
depending on its own facts and circumstances.
               In other judgment rendered by Hon’ble Apex court in the case of
State of Rajasthan Vrs. B. K. Meena, reported in 1996 6 SCC 417 the same view
has been reiterated by the Hon’ble Apex court.
               In the case of judgment rendered in the case of M. Paul Anthony
Vrs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. reported in (1999) the Hon’ble Apex court while
dealing with the situation of simultaneous continuation of departmental
proceeding vis-à-vis criminal proceeding, has arrived at following conclusions”
(i)    Departmental proceeding as well as proceeding in a criminal case can
       proceed simultaneously as there is no bar in their being conducted
       simultaneously though separately,

                                           6
(ii)  If the departmental proceeding and the criminal case are based on identical
       and similar set of facts and the charges in            the   criminal    case
       against the delinquent employee involves complicated question of law and
       fact, it would be desirable to stay the departmental proceeding till
       conclusion of the criminal case.
(iii) Whether the nature of the charge in a criminal case is grave and whether
       complicated question of facts and law involved in that case will depend
       upon the nature of offence, the nature of a case launched against the
       delinquent employee on the basis of evidence and the material facts against
       him during investigation or as reflected in the charge.
(iv)  The factors mentioned at (i) and (iii) above cannot be considered in isolation
       to stay the departmental proceeding but due regard has to be given to the
       facts that the departmental proceeding cannot be unduly delayed.
(v)   If the criminal case does not proceed or disposal is unduly delay, the
       departmental proceeding, even if there is stay on account of pendency of the
       criminal case, can be resumed and proceed with so as to conclude them at
       an early date, so that the employee if found not guilty his honour may be
       protected and in case he is found guilty, the administration may get rid of
       him at an earliest.
              In the case of Stanzen Toyotetsu India (P) Ltd. Vrs. Girish and
Others, reported in (2014) 3 SCC 636, their lordships of Hon’ble Apex Court, while
dealing with the situation of continuation of simultaneous proceeding both in
departmental as well as criminal proceeding, has been pleased to hold by taking

                                                7
note of all the earlier judgments rendered by it, holding at paragraph 16 therein
which reads as follows:-
               “16. Suffice it to say that while there is no legal bar to the holding of the
              disciplinary proceedings and the criminal trial simultaneously, stay of
              disciplinary proceedings may be an advisable course in cases where the
              criminal charge against the employee is grave and continuance of the
              disciplinary proceedings is likely to prejudice their defence before the criminal
              court. Gravity of the charge is, however, not by itself enough to determine the
              question unless the charge involves complicated question of law and fact. The
              court examining the question must also keep in mind that criminal trials get
              prolonged indefinitely especially where the number of accused arraigned for
              trial is large as is the case at hand and so are the number of witnesses cited
              by the prosecution. The court, therefore, has to draw a balance between the
              need for a fair trial to the accused on the one hand and the competing
              demand for an expeditious conclusion of the ongoing disciplinary proceedings
              on the other. An early conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings has itself
              been seen by this court to be in the interest of the employees.”
              We, after going into the judgment rendered in the case of Stanzen
Toyotetsu India (P) Ltd. Vrs. Girish and Others (supra), have found that in that
case the employee was proceeded criminally for the offences U/s.143, 147, 323,
324, 356, 427, 504, 506, 114 read with Sec.149 of Indian Penal Code.
              It is evident from all the judgments referred herein above that there
is no bar in simultaneous continuation of departmental proceeding as well as
criminal proceeding and each and every case has to be adjudged on the related
facts of the case.
 5.           The given fact of the instant case is that a criminal case was
instituted against the petitioner by instituting an F.I.R. for the offence U/s.120-B,
420, 468, 471 of the I.P.C. read with Sec.13(2)(1(e) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988 in which cognizance has been taken by the competent court having
criminal jurisdiction. Subsequently, a departmental proceeding has also been

                                            8
instituted by serving memorandum of charge on 10.5.2016 in exercise of power
conferred under Railway Servant (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968.
               In the backdrop of these aspect, submission has been made by the
petitioner that since on the same set of fact criminal case is going on as such the
departmental proceeding needs to be stayed otherwise he will be prejudiced in the
criminal trial.
6.             We, in order to examine with respect to the fact that as to whether
the departmental proceeding is fit to be stayed in the given facts or not, have
considered the ratio laid down by Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of M. Paul
Anthony Vrs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. (supra) wherein the ratio has been laid
down at paragraph 22(ii) and (iii) wherein it has been laid down that if the
departmental proceeding and the criminal case are based on identical and similar
set of facts and the charge against the delinquent employee is of grave nature
which involves complicated question of law, it is desirable to stay the departmental
proceeding till conclusion of the criminal case and as to whether the nature of a
charge is grave and whether complicated question of fact and law are involved in
that case, will depend upon the nature of the offence the nature of case launched
against the employee on the basis of evidence and material collected against him
during investigation or as reflected in the charge-sheet.
               We have examined the fact of this case in the light of the proposition
laid down by Hon’ble Apex Court as discussed above and are of the considered
view that the petitioner has failed to make out a case to come within the

                                                         9
        parameter of the ratio laid down in the case of M. Paul Anthony Vrs. Bharat Gold
        Mines Ltd. (supra) warranting the stay of the departmental proceeding.
                          So far as the case in hand which pertains to misrepresentation /
        suppression of material facts based upon the evidence which discloses that the
        petitioner has got an appointment on compassionate ground, hence it does not
        involve complicated question of fact, as such we are not in agreement with the
        submission advanced on behalf of learned counsel for the petitioner that if the
        departmental proceeding will be allowed to continue, he will be prejudiced in the
        criminal trial, reason being that both depend upon two different stand to prove the
        charges, in the criminal case the Evidence Act is strictly applicable while in the
        departmental proceeding it is on the preponderance of probability, the punishment
        is to be imposed.
        7.                We, after taking into consideration this aspect of the matter and the
        factual aspect, are of the considered view that the Tribunal has not erred in
        passing the order, accordingly we are not inclined to interfere with it.
                          In the result the writ petition fails and it is dismissed.
                                                                        ….…………………

Sanju Panda,            I agree.
                                                                        ….…………………
