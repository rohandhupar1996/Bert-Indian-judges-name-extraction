                   Present :     Mr. K.A. Guru, Advocate
                                 for the petitioner.
02.     19.03.2014              This petition seeks direction against initiation of
                        coercive measures by the Bank for recovery of loan under
                        the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
                                Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
                        petitioner is willing to repay the loan subject to decision of
                        his application to the Bank for grant of time and extending
                        benefit    under    the   One  Time   Settlement   Scheme,   if
                        applicable.    Learned     counsel  further  states  that  the
                        petitioner is willing to pay a sum of Rs.3,00,00,000/-
                        (Rupees Three Crores) within two months from today along
                        with the proposal for repayment for consideration of the
                        Bank.
                                Without expressing any opinion on merits, we direct
                        that if the petitioner makes deposit as aforesaid and files an
                        application for consideration of the Bank, the Bank may
                        take decision thereon in accordance with law within one
                        month and, till such decision is taken, the Bank may not
                        take coercive measures.
                                The petition is disposed of.
                                It is made clear that if the petitioner defaults in
                        making the deposit, this petition will be treated to have
                        been dismissed. It is further made clear that if the Bank is
                        aggrieved by this order, it will be at liberty to move this
                        Court.
                                                       ……......………………
