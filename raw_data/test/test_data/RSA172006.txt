Date of Judgment :             20.08.2015.
                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
1.      Plaintiff’s case is that the predecessor-in-interest of the
defendants viz., Late Budhu Bhumij was the occupant of a plot of
land measuring 2 bigha 15 lechas covered by dag No.1631 and
1632 of annual patta No.98 of Lahongaon under Anthkhel mouza
                                                                 Page 1 of 12

whereas the plaintiff was the owner in possession of a plot of land
measuring 2 bighas covered by dag No.506 of periodic patta No.55
of Morangaon under Anthkhel mouza, described in schedule to the
plaint, which is the suit land. Since the land belonging to Budhu
Bhumij, as aforesaid, was located near the land owned by the
plaintiff and vice versa, Budhu Bhumij and the plaintiff arrived at a
mutual understanding to exchange possession of their respective
plots of land for the sake of convenience of both parties and
accordingly Budhu Bhumij had executed an unregistered deed of
exchange (Ext-Ka) whereby the plaintiff was put in possession of the
2 bigha 15 lechas of land occupied and possessed by Budhu
Bhumij. Similarly, by executing another unregistered deed of
exchange the plaintiff had put Budhu Bhumij in possession in respect
of the suit land. It is, however, mentioned in Ext-Ka and Kha that the
parties would take a decision regarding continuance of this
exchange of possession on a future date. Thereafter, in the year
1983 Budhu Bhumij had converted his annual patta land, as
aforesaid, into periodic patta and thereafter, sold the same to the
son of the plaintiff for valuable consideration. The plaintiff’s further
case is that since Budhu Bhumij had sold the land in violation of the
condition of exchange, therefore, plaintiff wanted to regain
possession of his land. When he had approached the wife of Budhu
Bhumij to repay the amount of Rs.700/-, on the advice of Janu
Bhumij, she had refused to accept the money and rather insisted on
                                                            Page 2 of 12

renewal of the lease whereby it was agreed that the possession of
the suit land would be delivered to the plaintiff in the year 1989 and
an agreement to that effect was also executed by Janu Bhumij on
15.02.1984 in presence of witnesses. Accordingly, the wife of Budhu
Bhumij had handed over possession of the suit land to the plaintiff in
the year 1989. However, later on, while the plaintiff himself was
cultivating the land, on 21.06.1994 the defendants had trespassed
into the suit land and dispossessed the plaintiff for which the plaintiff
was compelled to initiate Misc. Case No.15/1994 under Section 145
Cr.P.C. at Najira Court. Eventually, the plaintiff had filed the Title Suit
seeking declaration of right, title, interest and for recovery of
possession in respect of the suit land.
2.     The defendant Nos.1 and 2 had contested the suit by
questioning the maintainability of the same on the ground of want
of cause of action as well as non-joinder of necessary parties. The
defendants, although admitted the fact that in the year 1974 there
was an exchange of the suit land with the plaintiff made by Budhu
Bhumij i.e. the father of the defendant No.2, whereby land
measuring 2 bigha 15 lechas belonging to Budhu Bhumij was
handed over to the plaintiff in lieu of the suit land, the defendants,
however, categorically denied the fact that they had ever sold the
land as claimed in the plaint. The defendants had also categorically
denied that they had ever trespassed into the suit land and
                                                              Page 3 of 12

dispossessed the plaintiff forcibly. On the contrary, the defendants
have claimed to have been in peaceful possession of the land
since 1974 and they have also denied that the plaintiff has been
cultivating over the land.
3.     Based on the pleadings of the parties the learned trial Court
had framed as many as eight issues, which are as follows :-
       “1.   Whether the suit is maintainable?
       2.    Whether there is cause of action for the suit?
       3.    Whether the plaintiff has right, title, interest and
             possession over the suit land?
       4.    Whether the suit land was cultivated by the defendants
             on lease as alleged ?
       5.    Whether     the   plaintiff   was    dispossessed   by    the
             defendants from the suit land as alleged?
       6.    Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree as prayed
             for?
       7.    Whether the defendants are entitled to compensation
             u/s 35-A of C.P.C.?
       8.    To what relief/reliefs the parties are entitled to?”
4.     Both sides had adduced evidence in support of their case.
Since the Issue No.3 was the key issue having a vital bearing on the
outcome of the suit, hence, the learned trial Court had taken up
the said issue for discussion first in point of time whereby on proper
appraisal of the evidence available on record the learned trial
Court had recorded a finding to the effect that the plaintiff was the
owner of the suit land having right, title and interest in respect
                                                               Page 4 of 12

thereof. The learned trial Court had also held that the land under
possession of Budhu Bhumij based on the mutual exchange had
been sold by him to Sri Munin Gogoi i.e. the sons of the plaintiff and
that the defendants could not establish the fact that the mutation
of the name of Munin Gogoi was done in respect of the suit land in
a fraudulent manner. The trial Court was, therefore, of the opinion
that the land was sold by Budhu Bhumij to Munin Gogoi in violation
of the conditions of exchange and as such the issue No.3 was
decided in favour of the plaintiff. Since the Issue No.3 was the most
important issue in the facts and circumstances of the case, hence,
the remaining issues also stood answered in favour of the plaintiff as
a result of which the plaintiff’s suit was decreed by the Court of first
instance.
5.     Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated
19.06.2004 passed by the learned trial Court in Title Suit No.6/1995
the defendants as appellants had preferred Title Appeal No.10/2004
in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Sivasagar. Upon hearing
the learned counsels for the parties, the learned Lower Appellate
Court had passed the impugned judgment and decree dated
25.08.2005 allowing the Title Appeal filed by the defendants thereby
reversing the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court.
                                                            Page 5 of 12

6.     Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated
25.08.2005 passed by the learned Lower Appellate Court, the
plaintiff as appellant has preferred the instant Second Appeal
before this Court which was admitted by framing the following
substantial questions of law :-
       “1.    Whether the right, title of the plaintiff over the suit land
              extinguished in view of registered deed of exchange
              (Ext.’Ka’ & ‘Kha’)?
       2.     Whether the findings of the Trial Court as regards
              Exts.’Ka’ & ‘Kha’ are perverse?”
7.      I have heard Mr. G. P. Bhowmik, learned senior counsel
appearing for the appellant. None appears for the respondents
despite the service of notice.
8.     By referring to the substantial question No.2 Mr. G. P. Bhowmik
points out, at the very outset, that there is a typographical error in
constituting the said substantial question of law as the question
raised in this appeal is regarding perversity of the findings of the
learned “Lower Appellate Court” and not the “Trial Court” as has
been reflected in the substantial question of law No.2 framed by this
Court. Mr. Bhowmik further submits that a bare perusal of the Exts-Ka
and Kha would go to show that those were mere arrangements
between the parties to enjoy possession in respect of each other’s
land during their pleasure only for the sake of convenience and
                                                               Page 6 of 12

such document did not in any way affect the right and title of the
parties in respect of their respective plots of land. Since it is the
admitted position of fact that the suit land belongs to the plaintiff
and in view of the evidence available on record to show that the
plaintiff has been wrongly dispossessed from the suit land even after
the defendants had restored the possession of the suit land to the
plaintiff, the learned trial Court had rightly decided the Issue No.3 in
favour of the plaintiff. However, by ignoring the material evidence
on record the learned Lower Appellate Court has reversed the
decree passed by the trial Court by recording a finding that the
defendants have been able to establish the fact that the suit land
belongs to them and they have never encroached the said plot of
land even when the defendants have admitted that the plaintiff is
the original owner of the suit land. Mr. Bhowmik submits that such a
finding recorded by the Lower Appellate Court is not only contrary
to the pleaded case of the defendants but is also perverse to the
evidence available on record.
9.     By referring to Section 118 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882, Mr. Bhowmik submits that from a bare perusal of the Exts-‘Ka’
and ‘Kha’ it would be apparent that the exchange in question was
neither complete nor did the same create or extinguish any right,
title and interest over any immoveable property of either parties in
respect of either of the two plots of land. Mr. Bhowmik further
                                                              Page 7 of 12

submits that the transaction in question does not pertake the
character of an exchange within the meaning of Transfer of
Property Act so as to create the rights and liabilities under Section
120 of the Transfer of Property Act.
10.    I have considered the submissions made by Mr. Bhowmik and
have also gone through the records of the case. The key question
that would arise for consideration of this Court is the answer to the
substantial question No.1 i.e. whether the Exts-Ka and Kha would
have the effect of creating and/or extinguishing rights, title and
interest of either party in respect of land originally owned by them.
Under the Transfer of Property Act sale of an immoveable property
having value of more than 100 rupees can be made only by a
registered instrument. Section 118 of the Transfer of Property Act
provides that the transfer of property by way of exchange can only
be made in the manner provided for transfer of such property by
way of sale. Section 118 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is
quoted herein below for ready reference :-
       “118. “Exchange” defined.--      When two persons mutually
       transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of
       another, neither thing or both things being money only, the
       transaction is called an “exchange”.
              A transfer of property in completion of an exchange
       can be made only in manner provided for the transfer of such
       property by sale.”
                                                            Page 8 of 12

From the reading of the aforesaid provision it would, thus, be
apparent that the documents Exts-Ka and Kha not being registered
documents and the value of the suit land admittedly being more
than Rs.100/-, the execution of the Exts-Ka & Kha did not constitute
a valid exchange within the meaning of Section 118 of the Transfer
of Property Act in as much as there was no change of ownership in
respect of the land in question by virtue of Exts-‘Ka’ and ‘Kha’.
11.   Section 120 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down the rights
and liabilities of the parties in case of an exchange which reads as
follows :-
      “120. Rights and liabilities of parties. --    Save as otherwise
      provided in this Chapter, each party has the rights and is
      subject to the liabilities of a seller as to that which he gives,
      and has the rights and is subject to the liabilities of a buyer as
      to that which he takes.”
12.   In the instant case, since it has already been held that the
Exts-Ka & Kha did not effect an exchange of immoveable property
within the meaning of Section 118 of the Transfer of Property Act,
hence, there is no question of affecting the rights and liabilities of
the parties within the meaning of Section 120 of the Transfer of
Property Act as well. That apart, a bare reading of the Ext-Ka & Kha
also goes to show that the same was an arrangement of temporary
nature whereby the parties had kept it open to take a final decision
                                                              Page 9 of 12

as regards the continuance of the mutual arrangement of land
swaping on a future date. As such, Exts-Ka & Kha did not have the
effect of creating or extinguishing the rights, title and interest of the
parties in respect of their respective plot of land and the substantial
question No.1 would stand answered accordingly.
13.     As had been indicated herein before the Exts-Ka & Kha did
not have any effect of either creating or extinguishing the title of
either of the parties in respect of their respective plots of land. Since
it is the admitted position of fact that the plaintiff is the original
owner of the suit land who had exchanged the possession of the
same with Budhu Bhumij on the basis of Ext-Kha, hence, there
cannot be any doubt about the fact that the right, title and interest
over the suit land pertains to none other than the plaintiff and
hence, he would be entitled to a declaration to such effect from
the Court. Once it is held that the plaintiff is the rightful owner in
respect of the suit land having clear title over the same, the plaintiff
would be entitled to recover possession in respect of the same
unless such a claim is successfully defeated by pleading and
establishing the claim of acquiring title by the defendants based on
adverse possession, which is not the case in the present. In that view
of the matter I am of the opinion that the learned trial Court had
rightly decided the Issue No.3 and there was no justifiable ground
for the learned Lower Appellate Court to reverse the said finding
                                                             Page 10 of 12

merely by holding that the defendants have been able to establish
the fact that the suit land belongs to them.
14.    Besides the aforementioned error committed by the learned
Lower Appellate Court, it can also be seen that the judgment and
decree passed by the Lower Appellate Court is also in clear
contravention of the mandate of Order XLI Rule 31 CPC in as much
as the learned Lower Appellate Court had neither stated the points
for determination nor recorded its independent decision on the
issues by giving reasons for such decision while reversing the
decision of the trial Court. In fact, the learned Lower Appellate
Court did not discuss even a single issue. As such, the impugned
judgment and decree passed by the learned Lower Appellate
Court is not sustainable in the eye of law on such count as well.
However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case
as well as the discussions herein before, I am of the opinion that the
plaintiff side has been able to prove and establish his case on the
basis of evidence available on record. On the contrary, the
defendants have not been able to lead sufficient evidence so as to
disprove the case of the plaintiff. In that view of the matter, I do not
consider it as a fit case for remand to the Lower Appellate Court
merely on the ground of contravention of Order XLI Rule 31 CPC
and on the contrary consider it appropriate to affirm the judgment
and decision of the trial Court by setting aside the judgment of the
                                                           Page 11 of 12

Lower      Appellate  Court.  It  is, however, made     clear   that
notwithstanding the judgment and decision rendered by this Court
today it would be open to the defendants to initiate appropriate
proceeding, as may be permissible under the law, to recover
possession of the land belonging to their ancestors measuring 2
bigha 15 lechas in total being the subject matter of Ext-Ka and if
any such proceeding is initiated by the defendants against the
plaintiff, the same would be decided on its own merit without being
influenced by any observation made by this Court today.
15.    With the above observation, this Second Appeal stands
allowed. There would be no order as to cost.
