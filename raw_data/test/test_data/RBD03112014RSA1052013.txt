     PRESENT :
             THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAGHUBIR DASH
      Date of hearing : 14.10.2014         Date of judgment : 03.11.2014
R. DASH, J. This Second Appeal is against the judgment and decree dated
     14.12.2012 and 27.12.2012, respectively, passed by the learned
     District Judge, Khurda in R.F.A.No.44 of 2007 confirming the
     judgment and decree dated 11.05.2007 and 21.06.2007, respectively,
     passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Bhubaneswar in
     T.S. No.152 of 1994-I.
     2.           Defendant Nos.2 and 3 have preferred this appeal.
     Respondent herein is the plaintiff before the trial court. Defendant
     No.1-Late Kumar Sahoo, the adoptive father of plaintiff-Respondent,

                                       2
having died during pendency of the First Appeal his name was
allowed to be deleted. In this judgment the parties will be addressed
as per their respective nomenclature in the plaint.
3.           Facts admitted by the parties are that plaintiff is the
adopted son of D-1 and his wife Late Ahalya Sahoo who has passed
away on 24.12.1993; that said Ahalya Sahoo was the only daughter
of Late Arta Sahoo and Late Nishamani; that the suit immovable
property described in Lot No.1 of the plaint schedule was partly
purchased in the name of Ahalya Sahoo by her parent and part of it
is inherited by her from her mother, Nishamani; that after the death
of Ahalya, her adopted son (plaintiff) went to his maternal uncle’s
house to be taken care of during his minority; that plaintiff’s adoptive
father (defendant No.1) alienated the plaint schedule Lot No.1
property to defendant Nos.2 and 3 under Registered Sale Deed
No.5437 dated 28.12.1993, just 4 days after the death of Ahalya and
during minority of the plaintiff.
             The plaintiff filed the suit inter alia for a declaration that
the Registered Sale Deed No.5437 dated 28.12.1993 is not binding on
him and no title has passed on to the vendees (D-2 and D-3) under
the sale deed.
4.           Plaintiff’s case, in short, is that the suit immovable
properties were inherited by her mother from her parents and,
therefore, in the presence of the plaintiff, the property did not devolve

                                     3
upon Ahalya’s husband (D-1). Further case is that D-1 had no right,
title and interest in the suit immovable properties and, therefore, the
sale deed executed by him cannot convey any title to D-2 and D-3.
The plaintiff has also taken the stand that D-2 and D-3 could manage
to obtain a sham sale deed inasmuch as the execution of the deed
was not the mental act of D-1.
5.           The defendants filed a joint written statement denying
the allegation that the Registered Sale Deed is a sham deed. They
have asserted that D-1 was the karta of the family consisting of his
wife, his son and he himself.       After death of his wife, D-1 was
providing all financial help to his minor son, who was staying in his
maternal uncle’s house to get education. D-1 alienated the suit
immovable properties for legal necessity, i.e., to meet expenses for
Shraddha ceremony of Ahalya and to construct a house.         The sale
transaction was for a consideration of Rs.50,000/- paid to D-1 and it
was followed by delivery of possession. Ever since the transfer of the
land, D-2 and D-3 have been in possession thereto. It is also claimed
that after death of Ahalya the suit property devolved upon the
plaintiff and D-1 simultaneously as per the provision contained in
Section 15(1)(a) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (for short, the
Act).
6.           Both the learned courts below have held that since
Ahalya died leaving behind a son and the source of inheritance is her

                                      4
parent, the rule of succession would be governed by Section 15(2)(a)
of the Act and, accordingly, the suit immovable property would
devolve upon her son to the exclusion of her husband. On behalf of
the  appellants it     is argued    that learned    courts below   have
misconceived the scope of Section 15(2)(a) of the Act, inasmuch as
Ahalya having died leaving behind a son, the general rule of
succession laid down under Section 15(1)(a) read with Section 16 (1)
of the Act would govern the field and both the son and the husband
would succeed simultaneously.
7.          The Second Appeal has been admitted on the following
substantial questions of law:-
            (1) When the admitted facts are that the deceased
            Ahalaya had died leaving behind one son and her
            husband and the Lot No.1 of plaint schedule
            property was inherited by her from her parents,
            whether the learned courts below have committed
            error in law in recording concurrent finding that
            the property will not devolve upon her husband
            simultaneously with her son under Section 15(1)(a)
            of the Hindu Succession Act but it shall devolve
            upon her son only ?
            (2) If the property in Lot No.1 of the plaint schedule
            will devolve simultaneously on the father and the
            son, whether Section 8 of the Hindu Minority and
            Guardianship Act, 1956 will operate against the
            transfer of the property made by the father ?
8.          For ready reference the provisions of law contained in
Section 15 of the Act is quoted hereunder:
            “15. General rules of succession in the case of
         female Hindus- (1) The property of a female Hindu

                                      5
         dying intestate shall devolve according to the rules set
         out in Section 16, -
         (a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters (including the
         children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the
         husband;
         (b) secondly, upon the heirs of the husband;
         (c) thirdly, upon the mother and father;
         (d) fourthly, upon the heirs of the father; and
         (e) lastly, upon the heirs of the mother.
         (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), –
         (a) any property inherited by a female Hindu from her
         father or mother shall devolve, in the absence of any
         son or daughter of the deceased (including the children
         of any pre-deceased son or daughter) not upon the
         other heirs referred to in sub-section (1) in the order
         specified therein, but upon the heirs of the father; and
         (b) any property inherited by a female Hindu from her
         husband or from her father-in-law shall devolve, in the
         absence of any son or daughter of the deceased
         (including the children of any pre-deceased son or
         daughter) not upon the other heirs referred to in sub-
         section (1) in the order specified therein, but upon the
         heirs of the husband.”
              There is no dispute over the proposition of law that if a
Hindu female dies intestate without leaving any issue then the
property inherited by her from her father or mother would go to the
heirs of her father whereas the property she has inherited from her
husband or her father-in-law would go to the heirs of her husband. In
the case in hand, the female Hindu has died leaving behind her son
as well as her husband and the suit property she has inherited from

                                       6
her parent. According to the learned counsel for the appellants, in
such a contingency the property shall devolve upon her son and her
husband simultaneously in accordance with sub-section (1) of Section
15 of the Act. But, according to the learned counsel for the
Respondent the husband stands excluded.
9.           While analyzing the aforequoted provisions of law,
Hon’ble apex Court in V. Dandapani Chettiar V. Balasubramanian
Chettiar (dead) by Lrs. and others, reported in 2003 (II) OLR (SC) –
497 has observed as follows:
       “9. The above Section propounds a definite and uniform
       scheme of a succession to the property of a female Hindu
       who dies intestate after the commencement of the Act.
       This Section groups the heirs of a female intestate into
       five categories described as Entries (a) to (e) and specified
       in Sub-section (1). Two exceptions, both of the same
       nature are engrafted by Sub-section (2) on the otherwise
       uniform order of succession prescribed by Sub-section
       (1). The two exceptions are that if the female dies without
       leaving any issue, then (1) in respect of the property
       inherited by her from her father or mother, that property
       will devolve not according to the order laid down in the
       five Entries (a) to (e), but upon the heirs of the father; and
       (2) in respect of the property inherited by her from her
       husband or father-in-law, it will devolve not according to
       the order laid down in the five Entries (a) to (e) of Sub-
       section (1) but upon the heirs of the husband. The two
       exceptions mentioned above are confined to the property
       “inherited” from the father, mother, husband and father-
       in-law of the female Hindu and do not affect the property
       acquired by her by gift or by device under a Will of any of
       them. The present Section 15 has to be read in
       conjunction with Section 16 which evolves a new and
       uniform order of succession to her property and regulates
       the manner of its distribution. In other words, the order
       of succession in case of property inherited by her from
       her father or mother, its operation is confined to the case

                                       7
        of dying without leaving son, a daughter or children of
        any predeceased son or daughter.
        10. Sub-section (2) of Section 15 carves out an
        exception in case of a female dying intestate without
        leaving son, daughter or children of a predeceased son or
        daughter. In such a case, the rule prescribed is to find
        out the source from which she has inherited the property.
        If it is inherited from her father or mother, it would
        devolve as prescribed under Section 15 (2)(a). If it is
        inherited by her from her husband or father-in-law, it
        would devolve upon the heirs of her husband under
        Section 15(2)(b). The clause enacts that in a case where
        the property is inherited by a female from her father or
        mother, it would devolve not upon the other heirs, but
        upon the heirs of her father. This would mean that if
        there is no son or daughter including the children of any
        predeceased son or daughter, then the property would
        devolve upon the heirs of her father. Result would be – if
        the property is inherited by a female from her father or
        her mother, neither her husband nor his heirs would get
        such property, but it would revert back to the heirs of her
        father.”
10.           In S.R. Srinivasa and Ors. -Vrs.- S. Padmavathamma,
reported in 2010 (II) OLR (SC) – 286, it is further observed as follows:
              “…..basic aim of Section 15(2) is to ensure
              that inherited property of an issueless
              female Hindu dying intestate goes back to
              the source. It was enacted to prevent
              inherited property falling into the hands of
              strangers”
              In   Dilip    Kumar       Vrs.   Damodar     Narayanrao
Rammangudkar, reported in AIR 2006 Karnataka 115, it has
been held that where the female Hindu has died intestate leaving
behind her son and husband, Section 15 (1) would be applicable as it
is clear from the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the Act

                                     8
that absence of any son or daughter of the deceased (including
children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) is a condition
precedent for application of provision of Section 15 (2) of the Act.
11.         In the same light the provisions of Section 15 (2) of the
Act have been analysed in the text book Mulla on Principles of Hindu
Law (21st Edition 2010). At page-1185-1186 of the book, the law laid
down in Section-15 of the Act has been summarized as follows:
            (1)   The general order of succession laid
                  down in entries (a) to (e) in sub-s (1)
                  applies to all property of a female
                  intestate however acquired except in
                  case of property inherited by her from
                  her father, mother, husband or father-
                  in-law.
            (2)   In case of a female intestate leaving a
                  son or a daughter or a child of a pre-
                  deceased son or of a predeceased
                  daughter, that is leaving any issue, all
                  her property, howsoever acquired,
                  devolves on such issue regardless of
                  the source of acquisition of the
                  property and such issue takes the
                  property simultaneously; and if the
                  husband of the intestate is alive they
                  take simultaneously with him in
                  accordance with entry (a). In such a
                  case sub-s (2) does not at all come
                  into operation.
            (3)   In case of a female intestate dying
                  without issue but leaving her
                  husband, the husband will take all
                  her     property,     except    property
                  inherited by her from her father or
                  mother which will revert to the heirs
                  of the father in existence at the time of
                  her death.

                                        9
              (4)    In case of female intestate dying
                     without issue property inherited by
                     her from her husband or father-in-law
                     (the husband being dead), will go to
                     the heirs of the husband and not in
                     accordance with the general order of
                     succession laid down in sub-s (1).
              (5)    In case of a female intestate dying
                     without issue property inherited by
                     her from her father or mother will
                     revert to the heirs of the father in
                     existence at the time of her death and
                     not in accordance with the general
                     order of succession laid down in sub-s
                     (1).
              At page-1189 of the text book, Illustration No.(ii) is to the
effect that if the female Hindu dies leaving her surviving husband and
any issue, then all her property including property which is inherited
from her parent would devolve simultaneously upon her husband
and her issues as heirs specified in entry (a) of Section-15(1) of the
Act. The Illustration is extracted hereunder:-
              (ii)   A dies leaving her surviving a son S;
                     an adopted daughter D; and her
                     husband H. All the property of A,
                     howsoever acquired, will devolve
                     simultaneously upon S, D and H as
                     heirs specified in Entry (a).
12.           What is understood from the aforestated analysis of the
rules of succession contained in Section 15 of the Act is that while
Section 15 (1) lays down the ordinary rule of succession, sub-section
(2) which starts with a non-obstante clause carves out two exceptions:
(i) if the female dies without leaving any issue, then the property

                                      10
inherited by her from her father or mother would devolve not
according to the general rule laid down in sub-section (1) but upon
the heirs of her father, and (ii) if the female dies without leaving an
issue, the property inherited by her from her husband or from her in-
laws would devolve not according to the general rule laid down in
sub-section (1) but upon the heirs of the husband. Thus, it is made
clear that when a female Hindu dies intestate without leaving any
son, daughter or children of any pre-deceased son or daughter the
property inherited by her from her father or mother and/or from her
husband or father-in-law is to go back to the source from which she
got it. From this position of law it can be construed that if a female
Hindu dies intestate leaving behind any issue, the exception
contained in sub-section (2) of Section-15 of the Act will not come into
operation and it is the ordinary rule of succession contained in sub-
section (1) of Section 15 of the Act that will govern the field.
13.          Learned lower Appellate Court is of the view that since
sub-Section (2) starts with a non-obstante clause, the provisions of
sub-Section (1) cannot be taken aid of and the former has to be read
in isolation of the latter. Then it proceeds to hold that if a female
Hindu dies leaving behind any issue then the property that she has
inherited from her parents would devolve only upon the issues (son or
daughter including the children of any predeceased son or daughter)
and not upon any other heirs as listed in sub-Section (1) including

                                     11
her husband. According to learned lower Appellate Court, the
husband would under no circumstances come into picture of
inheritance in respect of the property the female Hindu has inherited
from her parents.
14.          Learned counsel for the Respondent justifies this view of
the learned Courts below by relying on the judgment of the Hon’ble
apex Court in Radhika v. Aghnu Ram, reported in (1995) 2 East LJ
13 (SC). In Radhika’s case (supra) the female Hindu (Radhika) had
died leaving behind her husband and one son. Her husband filed a
suit claiming half share as her Class-I heir. The trial court dismissed
the suit on the ground that during the life time of Radhika she had
bequeathed the properties to her son under a gift deed. In the First
Appeal, the District Judge reversed the decree and held that the gift
was not valid and that the husband and the son being Class-I heirs
are entitled to partition of the property in equal moiety. The Second
Appeal challenging the decree of the District Judge was dismissed. In
the appeal by Special Leave, Hon’ble apex Court, taking note of the
provisions of Section 15 of the Act, observed that for the property
inherited by a female Hindu from her father or mother, in the absence
of her son, daughter or children of the pre-deceased son or daughter,
the succession opens to heirs of the father or mother and not to
Class-I heirs in the order specified in sub-section (1) of Section-15
and in the order of Section-16 of the Act. In other words, it is

                                     12
observed, the children and the children of pre-deceased son or
daughter of the Hindu female alone are entitled to get such property
and the husband stands excluded from the succession to the property
inherited by a female Hindu from her father’s side.
15.         It is true that the facts situation in the case in hand is
similar to that of Radhika’s case (supra). Learned counsel for the
Appellants tries to distinguish the fact situation of both the cases
submitting that in Radhika’s case deceased Radhika, under a gift
deed, had bequeathed the suit property to her son. But, it cannot be
distinguished that way. The above observation of the Hon’ble Apex
Court is on the general application of the rule laid down under
Section 15 (2) of the Act. However, with due respect to the Hon’ble
Apex Court’s such observation, this Court is of the view that the
observation made by the Hon’ble Apext Court in V. Dandapani
Chettiar’s and S.R. Srinivasa’s cases, which have been pronounced
subsequent to Radhika’s case, are to be followed and, accordingly, it
is to be held that in the presence of any issue the Hindu female’s
property which she inherited from her parent would devolve
simultaneously on her husband and her issue (s) in accordance with
Section 15 (1) read with Section 16 of the Act.
16.         As regards the second question on the applicability of
Section 8 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, it is
contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that when the

                                      13
property devolves simultaneously upon the plaintiff and defendant
No.1 (the son and the husband of the deceased female Hindu) and
there was no partition of the said property, sub-sections 2 and 3 of
Section 8 of the Minority and Guardianship Act will have no
application and, consequently, the sale deed executed by D.1
alienating the entire of Lot-I properties in favour of the respondents is
not voidable at the instance of the plaintiff. In support of the
contention learned counsel cites the judgment of the apex Court
reported in AIR 1996 SC 2371 (Sri Narayan Bal V. Sridhar Sutar),
besides a judgment of this High Court reported in 1974 (1) CWR 432
(Sunamani Dei V. Babaji Das and others) and a judgment of Bombay
High Court reported in AIR 1994 Bombay 152 (Narayan Laxman
Gilankar V. Udayakumar Kasinath Kaushik). But all these cited
judgments are in respect of property in which the minor in the
respective cases had an undivided share in joint Hindu family
property. The law is well settled that the interest of a minor in the
joint family property is kept outside the ambit of Sections 6 and 12 of
the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act. In respect of minor’s
undivided interest in joint family property the natural guardian of the
minor can deal with it in accordance with the Hindu Law. But, the
property which is subject matter of the case in hand cannot be said to
be in the nature of joint family property, and, merely for the reason
that   the  properties   devolved   upon     the  father   and  the  son

                                             14
simultaneously, it cannot be said that the son had an undivided
interest in the joint family property. Therefore, Section 8 of the Hindu
Minority and Guardianship Act will operate against the transfer of the
property made by the father under the Registered Sale Deed dated
23.11.1993. Consequently, the sale transaction is voidable to the
extent of minor’s 50% interest in Lot-I of the plaint schedule.
17.          In view of the answer to both the substantial questions of
law the Second Appeal is allowed. Impugned judgment and decree
passed by the learned 1st Appellate Court confirming the judgment
and decree of the Trial Court are set aside. Plaintiff’s suit is decreed in
part. The sale transaction vide the Registered Sale Deed dated
23.11.1993 is held to be void to the extent of plaintiff’s 50% interest
in the plaint schedule Lot-I property. Since the suit is of the year
1994 and this Court does not want the parties to be driven to another
round of litigation to have their respective share carved out, this
Court observes that this be treated as a preliminary decree giving
liberty to either of the parties to approach the trial court to initiate
final decree proceeding to get the property partitioned.
             There shall be no order as to cost.
