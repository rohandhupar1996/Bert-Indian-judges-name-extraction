           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. N. Prasad, J.          This writ petition has been filed questioning the engagement of
           opposite party no.4 on the ground that after being selected she has un-
           necessarily been harassed by the Child Development Project Officer and even
           at the time of engagement the concerned CDPO has demanded gratification
           and when part of it has not been paid, then in order to take vengeance the
           order of disengagement has been passed even without following the principle
           of natural justice.
           2.             Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of opposite party
           nos.1 to 3 wherein stand has been taken that on subsequent verification it
           was found that the certificate regarding educational qualification furnished
           by the petitioner at the time of selection was found to be forged and in this

                                      2
regard an enquiry was also directed to be conducted by the Sub-Collector,
Udala and in course of enquiry it came to notice          that   the   certificate
produced by the petitioner is not genuine. Further it also came to notice
that no transfer certificate was issued on 17.8.1988 and the signature of the
Headmaster who signed the transfer certificate was not found tallied from
the signature reflecting in the transfer certificate and as such the
Headmaster vide letter no.52/97 dtd.21.10.1997 has informed the Sub-
Collector, Kaptipada, Udala that on verification of the certificate issued to the
petitioner the entries made in the transfer certificate of the petitioner was
forged and taking into consideration all these aspect the petitioner was
disengaged from service.
             However, time was allowed to the learned counsel for the
petitioner for filing response to the counter affidavit but no response has
been filed.
3.           Heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the
documents on record.
             The petitioner had been engaged as Anganwadi Worker,
subsequently she has been disengaged vide order dtd.27.3.1998 on the
ground of submission of forged educational certificate at the time of selection
as Anganwadi Worker 4.6.1997.
             On perusal of the order of engagement dtd.4.6.1997 it is evident
that the petitioner was appointed as Anganwadi Worker initially for a period
of two years on probation with a condition that if she is found unsuitable or
does not discharge her duty properly or if serious allegations are made
against her the order of engagement will be cancelled with the prior written
order of the Collector who is the Chairman of t he Selection Committee for
selection of Anganwadi Worker and after accepting the terms of the offer of
engagement, the petitioner has been engaged and started discharging her
duty.

                                      3
              From perusal of the terms and condition of the engagement
order it is evident that the petitioner’s nature of appointment was purely
temporary on probation for a period of two years and the case of the
petitioner is that the CDPO in order to take vengeance has issued the order
of disengagement that to without serving show cause notice.
              From perusal of the counter affidavit filed by opposite parties it
is evident that specific statement has been made regarding forged
educational certificate and the forged transfer certificate which has been
corroborated by the Headmaster of the concerned school.
              Further in the order of disengagement no such ground has been
taken but from perusal of the counter affidavit it is evident that the
allegation of submission of forged certificate has been alleged. However, the
said ground has been disputed by learned counsel for the petitioner but no
response has been filed in this regard, hence the stand taken by opposite
parties in the counter affidavit is admitted being not rebutted by the
petitioner.
4.            So far as the ground of non observance of principle of Natural
Justice is concerned there is no dispute about the fact that the Principle of
Natural Justice is the cardinal principle of rule of Law.
              Natural justice is an expression of English Common Law. It is
developed with this fundamental in mind that those whose duty is to decide,
must act judicially. They must deal with the question referred both without
bias and they must given to each of the parties to adequately present the
case made. The principles of natural justice developed over a period of time
and which is still in vogue and valid even today where: (i) rule against bias,
(ii) opportunity of being heard to the concerned party, i.e. audi alteram
partem. These are known as principles of natural justice. To these principles
a third principle is added, which is of recent origin. It is duty to give reason
in support of decision, namely, passing of a reasoned order.

                                     4
              There is no dispute about the fact that the principle of natural
justice are grounded in procedural fairness which         ensures   taking   of
correct decision and procedural fairness is fundamentally                  and
instrumental good, in the sense that procedure should be designed to ensure
accurate or appropriate outcomes. In fact, procedural fairness is valuable in
both instrumental and non-instrumental terms. It is for this reason that the
courts have consistently insisted that such procedural fairness has to be
adhered to before a decision is made and infraction thereof has led to the
quashing of decisions taken. In this connection the judgment rendered in
case of A. K. Kraipak Vrs. Union of India, (1969) 2 SCC 262 wherein it
was held that the rules of natural justice operate in areas not covered by any
law. They do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it and their
aim is to secure justice or to prevent miscarriage of justice and therefore it
has made applicable to the decision to be taken in the administrative
proceedings for the purpose of achieving that the enquiry must be held in
good faith and without bias and not arbitrarily or unreasonably.
              In the case of Chairman, board of Mining Examination Vrs.
Ramjee (1977) 2 SCC 256 the Hon’ble Apex Court has observed that
natural justice is not an unruly horse, no lurking landmine, nor a judicial
cure-all. If fairness is shown by the decision-maker to the man proceeded
against, the form, features and the fundamentals of such essential
processual propriety being conditioned by the facts and circumstances of
each situation, no breach of natural justice can be complained of.
              In the case of Institute of Chartered Accounts of India Vrs.
L.K. Ratna, (1986) 4 SCC 537, Charan Lal Sahu Vrs. Union of India,
(1990) 1 SCC 613 and C. B. Gautam Vrs. Union of India (1993) 1 SCC 78
the doctrine that the principle of natural justice must be applied in the
unoccupied interstices of the statute unless there is a clear mandate to the
contrary is reiterated.

                                       5
             Thus it is now settled that the proceedings must be just, fair
and reasonable and negation thereof offends Articles 14 and 21. It is well
settled law that principles of natural justice are integral part of Article.
             But there may be situation wherein for some reason perhaps
because the evidence against the individual is thought to be utterly
compelling, it is felt that a fair hearing would make no difference, meaning
that a hearing would not change the ultimate conclusion reached by the
decision maker, then no legal duty to supply a hearing arises. Such an
approach was endorsed by Lord Wilberforce in Malloch Vrs. Aberdeen
Corporation, (1971) 1 WLR 1578 wherein it has been stated that a breach of
procedure --- cannot give a remedy in the courts, unless behind it there is
something of substance which has been lost by the failure. The court does
not act in vain. Relying on these comments, Brandon LJ opined in
Cinnamond Vrs. British Airports Authority, (1980) 1 WLR 582 that no one
can complain of not being given an opportunity to make representations if
such an opportunity would have availed him nothing. In such situations, fair
procedures appear to serve no purpose since right result can be secured
without according such treatment to the individual.
             In the case of Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad & Ors.
Vrs. B. Karunakar & Ors, (1993) 4 SCC 727 the relevant paragraph i.e.
paragraph 30 is being quoted herein below:
        “30. Hence the incidental questions raised above may be answered
        as follows:
        Xxxxxxx            xxxxxxx            xxxxxxx
        (v) The next question to be answered is what is the effect on the
        order of punishment when the report of the enquiry officer is not
        furnished to the employee and what relief should be granted to him
        in such cases. The answer to this question has to be relative to the
        punishment awarded. When the employee is dismissed or removed
        from service and the inquiry is set aside because the report is not
        furnished to him, in some cases the non-furnishing of the report
        may have prejudiced him gravely while in other cases it may have

                                      6
        made no difference to the ultimate punishment awarded to him.
        Hence to direct reinstatement of the employee with back-wages in
        all cases is to reduce the rules of justice to a mechanical
        ritual. The theory of reasonable opportunity             and      the
        principles of natural justice have been evolved to uphold the rule of
        law and to assist the individual to vindicate his just rights. They
        are not incantations to be invoked nor rites to be performed on all
        the sundry occasions. Whether in fact, prejudice has been caused
        to the employee or not on account of the denial to him of the report,
        has to be considered on the facts and circumstances of each case.
        Where, therefore, even after the furnishing of the report, no
        different consequence would have followed, it would be a
        perversion of justice to permit the employee to resume duty
        and to get all the consequential benefits. It amounts to
        rewarding the dishonest and the guilty and thus to stretching
        the concept of justice to illogical and exasperating limits. It
        amounts to an ‘unnatural expansion of natural justice’ which
        in itself is antithetical to justice.”
             Yet another judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of
Aligarh Muslim University Vrs. Mansoor Ali Khan, (2000) 7 SCC 529
needs to be referred here. In that case Hon’ble Apex Court have held that
the relevant rule provided automatic termination of service of an employee
on unauthorized absence for certain period. M remained absent for more
than five years and, hence, the post was deemed to have been vacated by
him. M challenged the order being violative of natural justice as no
opportunity of hearing was afforded before taking the action. Though the
Court held that the rules of natural justice were violated, it refused to set
aside the order on the ground that no prejudice was caused to M. Referring
to several cases, considering the theory of “useless” or “empty” formality
and noting “admitted or undisputed” facts, the Court held that the only
conclusion which could be drawn was that had M been given a notice, it
“would not have made any difference” and, hence, no prejudice had been
caused to M.
5.           In the light of the proposition as referred hereinabove even if
the notice would have been issued to the petitioner the things could not
have been changed since the allegation against the petitioner was of

                                      7
submission of forged educational certificate as also the transfer certificate
said to have been obtained from the school and             the      concerned
Headmaster of the school has categorically stated           that    no   such
certificate has been issued under the signature of Headmaster, hence there
would not have been change in the factual position.
               In view thereof issuance of notice for mere following the
Principle of Natural Justice will be said to be an empty formality.
6.             Moreover since the engagement is of the year 1998 and
eighteen years has already elapsed and the nature of appointment of
Anganwadi Worker is purely temporary based upon the contract and as
such the petitioner has got no legal vested right to remain in the post and
after lapse of 18 years there is every likelihood that so many Anganwadi
Workers might have been selected in the meanwhile considering the nature
of engagement of the Anganwadi Workers.
               In view of the foregoing reasons, this court declines from
interfering with the decision taken by the authorities.
               Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed being devoid of
merit.
                                                    ….…………………
