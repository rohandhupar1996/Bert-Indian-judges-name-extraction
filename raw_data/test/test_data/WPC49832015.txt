                                  BEFORE
            HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
1.9.2015
        Heard Mr. NH Mazarbhuyan, learned counsel representing the
petitioner. Also heard Mr. PS Deka, learned counsel representing
Respondent Nos.1, 2, 3 and 4 and Mr. TJ Mahanta, learned Senior
counsel assisted by Mr. D Mahanta, Advocate, representing Respondent
No.5.
2.      Considering the nature of the grievance raised in this writ
petition, the same is taken up for final disposal at the motion stage
itself.
3.      Challenge is made to the judgment and order dated 21.7.2015
passed by the Court of the learned District Judge –cum-Panchayat
Election Tribunal, Nagaon in Election Petition No.11/2013. The said
election petition was initiated by the Respondent No.5 herein. By the
said judgment and order, the election petition was allowed on contest
with order for recounting of the ballot votes in respect of the post of
President of the 69 Bogoriguri Gaon Panchayat under No.14 Singia Zila
Parishad, district Nagaon.
4.      Before testing the legality and validity of the judgment and order
dated 21.7.2015, it would be apposite to understand the basic
requirements laid down by the Apex Court in a catena of decisions in so
far as the scope of the Court for scrutiny of ballot papers and order for
recounting is concerned. At the outset and having regard to the law laid
down by the Apex Court, an order of recounting of votes has to stand or
fall having regard to the averments made in the election petition and the
materials produced in support thereof. Reference is made to the case of
Udey Chand vs. Surat Singh and Anr. reported in (2009) 10 SCC
170 wherein a host of other decisions of the Apex Court have been

                                     2
referred to. The two basic requirements justifying the order of
recounting of the ballot papers have been laid down as follows:
        a.      The election petition seeking recount of the ballot papers
                must contain adequate statements of all the material
                facts on which the allegation of irregularity or illegality in
                counting are founded; and
        b.      On the edifice of evidence adduced in support of the
                allegations, the Election Tribunal must be prima facie
                satisfied that in order to decide the dispute and to do
                complete and effectual justice between the parties,
                making of an order of recount is imperatively necessary.
        The high degree of probability that must exist for recount of
votes is primarily because of the fact that importance of secrecy of ballot
papers and to guard against any circumstances that may lead to
breaching of the secrecy must be maintained and the said factors must
weigh in the mind of the Court. To reiterate, the justification for an
order of recount of votes must be based on the materials placed by an
election petitioner on the threshold before an order of recount of votes
can actually be made. Unless the affected candidate is able to allege and
substantiate any acceptable measure by means of evidence or
contemporaneous evidence that a prima facie case of high degree of
probability exists for recount of votes, a Tribunal will not be right in
ordering recount of votes as a matter of course.
5.      Turning to the facts in the instant case, the petitioner along with
Respondent No.5 had contested for the post of President of 69
Bogoriguri Gaon Panchayat election held on 30.1.2013. Upon counting
of the votes the petitioner was shown to have received 2161 votes,
whereas the Respondent No.5 was shown to have received 2126 votes.
On a difference of 35 numbers of votes, the petitioner was declared
elected and accordingly, Certificate to that end was issued by the

                                      3
Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon on 16.2.2013. In so far as the votes
polled in the said election is concerned, the total valid votes together
with the postal ballots stood at 4287 votes, out of which as many as 171
numbers of votes stood rejected.
6.      Respondent No.5 being aggrieved of the result of the election
preferred election petition under Section 127 read with Section 129(b) of
the Assam Panchayat Act, 1994 before the Court of District Judge –cum-
Panchayat Election Tribunal, Nagaon. The said petition was registered
and numbered as Election Petition No.11/2013. Statements and material
facts urged in the said election petition were as follows:
        i)      The postal ballots were not opened by the Counting
        Officer in presence of the Counting Agents of the Respondent
        No.5. In fact, without opening and counting the postal ballots,
        the result sheet, however, revealed that it had been counted;
        (ii)    Out of 171 votes that had been rejected, as many as 140
        votes were in favour of the Respondent No.5;
        (iii)   Some of the valid votes cast in favour of the Respondent
        No.5 have been wrongly pushed into the bundle of the
        petitioner; and
        (iv)    Complaints made to the authorized officer who was in
        charge of Hall No.6 were not responded to.
        The allegations were basically upon improper rejection of valid
votes and improper acceptance of votes in favour of the petitioner
which, actually had been cast in favour of the Respondent No.5. The
said election petition was duly responded to by the petitioner by means
of a written objection filed on 30.7.2013.
7.      During the proceedings before the Election Tribunal and on the
basis of the pleadings of the rival parties, the following issues were
framed:

                                      4
        (i)     Whether there is any cause of action and whether the
        election petition is maintainable in its present form?
        (ii)    Whether there was any illegality or irregularity in
        counting of votes as alleged in the petition?
        (iii)   Whether the petitioner is entitled to any relief, if so what?
        As many as four witnesses including the Respondent No.5 were
examined and to that end had also filed evidence on affidavit. In so far
as the petitioner is concerned, as many as five witnesses were examined
which included one official witness.
8.      It appears from the judgment and order under challenge that
each of the issues were discussed and the evidence adduced in support
of and against the allegations by the respective witnesses on both sides
were duly taken into consideration. On a conspectus of the material
facts, the statements made in the election petition as well as on the
basis of the evidence that had come on record, the Tribunal arrived at
the finding that the election petitioner/Respondent No.5 had succeeded
to establish by preponderance of evidence that anomalies had occurred
at the time of counting of votes in the election of the President of 69
Bogoriguri Gaon Panchayat. The issues framed for adjudication of the
case were answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, an order was
passed allowing the petition with a direction for recount of the ballot
votes by the Sheristadar of the establishment in presence of both the
contesting candidates and their engaged counsels.
9.      On a perusal of the available records what transpires is that the
election petition contained adequate statements of the material facts for
seeking recount of the ballot votes. Issues for adjudication were
accordingly framed, affidavits by way of evidence had also been filed
and the witnesses had also been subjected to cross-examination and
thereafter, on the basis of the evidence adduced, the Tribunal was
prima facie satisfied that recount of ballot votes was imperatively

                                      5
necessary to decide the dispute and to do complete justice between the
parties. A perusal of the available records also goes to show that it is
not a case where any vague or bald allegation of irregularity in the
counting process had been made. As noticed above, there was sufficient
evidence available on records warranting a recount. At this stage, Mr. TJ
Mahanta, learned Senior counsel representing Respondent No.5 makes
reference to the evidence of the petitioner to show that even the
petitioner did not object to opening and examination of the cancelled
votes.
10.     Be that as it may, and for all the reasons indicated above, the
judgment and order dated 21.7.2015 passed by the District Judge-cum-
Panchayat Election Tribunal, Nagaon in Election Petition No.11/2013 do
not call for any interference. The writ petition being devoid of merit is
accordingly, dismissed and the judgment and order under challenge is
upheld.
11.     The parties are left to bear their own costs.
                                                             JUDGE
