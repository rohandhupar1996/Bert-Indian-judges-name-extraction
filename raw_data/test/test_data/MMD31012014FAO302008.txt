      P R E S E N T:
                              THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M.M.DAS
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. Das, J.             Both the appeals have been filed by the appellant against
      the common judgment and order dated 19.2.2005 passed in Original
      Suit No. 9 of 2003 (Probate Misc. Case No. 19 of 1996) and Original
      Suit No. 10 of 2003 (Probate Misc. Case No. 1 of 1997) by the learned
      Civil Judge (Senior Division), First Court, Cuttack.
      2.                 O.S. No. 9 of 2003 was filed by the present respondent
      under Sections 276 and 278 of the Indian Succession Act for grant of

                                    2
probate of the Will dated 6.11.1995 and O.S. No. 10 of 2003 was filed
by the present appellant for grant of probate of the Will dated
26.1.1995. Both the Wills were executed by the testatrix, namely,
Major Miss. Sybil Holmes, daughter of late Alfred Joseph Holmes.
The appellant was the defendant in O.S. No. 9 of 2003, where the
respondent was the plaintiff and it was vice-versa in O.S. No. 10 of
2003.
3.           It appears from the facts of the case that under Ext. 1,
the Will allegedly executed in favour of the respondent by the
testatrix on 6.11.1995 has been drafted in English. The entire
movable and immoveable properties of the testatrix have been
bequeathed to the propounder (respondent) to be utilized for the
purpose of running an orphanage for the orphans and destitute
children.   The properties so bequeathed is placed under three
schedules i.e. A, B and C.    In Schedule-A, the furniture, fixtures,
utensils, sewing machines and telephone etc. are bequeathed.       In
Schedule-B, the bank accounts of different banks and in Schedule-C,
the immoveable properties consisting of one pucca building with
vacant land of Ac. 0.76 decimals and an English Medium School at
Kesharpur in the name and style of “Major Holmes School” started in
the year, 1974 are bequeathed to the beneficiary. Therefore, Ext. 1
contains a complete list of the total moveable and immoveable left
behind by the deceased testatrix.    The peculiarity of the bequeath
made in Ext. 1 is that the executor has been restrained and directed

                                    3
not to sell or mortgage the Schedule-C properties in any manner. As
such, the intention behind the disposition is that the executor is to
act more or less as a manager of the proposed orphanage and not to
alienate the same for his personal benefit or gain.
4.           Ext. A, the Will allegedly executed on 26.1.1995 in
favour of the present appellant is drafted in Oriya. In Ext. A, only a
part of immoveable property out of the property mentioned under
Ext. 1 has been bequeathed in favour of the present appellant. The
said Ext. A is silent about the rest part of the building, vacant
portion of the land, bank accounts, moveable properties like
furniture and fixtures and other articles. There is no mention in Ext.
A with regard to management of the institution established by the
testatrix i.e. English Medium School named as “Major Holmes
School” at Kesharpur, Cuttack.
5.           As stated above, the testatrix in both the Wills is the
same person, who appears to be a pious Christian lady and was
leading a retired life from nursing service in defence.      The facts
further reveal that she had a deep concern for the orphans and her
only desire was to save and take care of the life of such orphans and
destitute children, because she herself was an orphan and prior to
death, she served the orphans for many years. These facts can be
considered to be admitted by both the parties from the materials on
record.

                                       4
6.            With regard to the past career of the testatrix, it appears
that her mother tongue was English. She was studying outside the
country and was a foreigner. She was making all correspondences in
English and was not able to read and write Oriya, but, however, she
was able to speak Oriya to some extent.
7.            Upon the pleadings being completed and the documents
produced by the parties being marked as Exts. as well as the oral
evidence being recorded, the trial court framed the issues to be
answered which are follows:
      (i)   Whether the testatrix had a disposing mind, if ‘yes’,
            in what manner?
      (ii) Whether the two ‘Wills’ have been properly executed
            and attested?
      (iii) Whether     there    is     suspicious   and    vicious
            circumstances existing in any of the Wills?
      (iv)   Which of the two Wills is the last Will and is to be
            probated?
8.            Probate of a Will cannot be allowed, if the court comes to
the  conclusion     that   such    Will   is  shrouded   by   suspicious
circumstances or the same is created fraudulently. The trial court
on Issue Nos. 2 and 3, which are vital issues, after discussing the
evidence adduced by the parties, found that there is no dispute with
regard to identity of the testatrix in both the Wills and the fact that
the properties bequeathed in both the Wills belong to the testatrix.

                                      5
Further, it is an admitted case that under the Will (Ext. A), a part of
the properties as mentioned in the Will (Ext. 1) is covered.
9.           Considering the surrounding circumstances and the
nature of the evidence adduced, the trial court found that the Will
(Ext. A) dated 26.1.1995 allegedly executed in favour of the appellant
has not been executed by the testatrix, late Major Miss Sybil Holmes
and it is not proved to be the outcome of free Will and volition of the
testatrix and it is also not duly proved. On the other hand, the Will
dated 6.11.1995 under Ext. 1 executed by the testatrix in favour of
the present respondent, who was the plaintiff in O.S. No. 9 of 2003,
is duly attested and it is the outcome of free Will and volition of late
Major Miss Sybil Holmes. With regard to Issue No. 4, in view of its
findings on the above two issues, the trial court recorded that Ext. 1
is the last Will of the testatrix, which is free from all suspicions and
the same is genuine being an outcome of the free Will and volition of
the testatrix.    On Issue No. 1, the trial court found that the
respondent, who was the plaintiff in O.S. No. 9 of 2003, is the
propounder of Ext. 1 and has got cause of action to file the suit.
Lastly, the trial court found that in view of its findings on the
foregoing issues, the plaintiff in O.S. No. 9 of 2003 (respondent
herein) is entitled to the prayer for grant of probate of the Will dated
6.11.1995 under Ext. 1. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the
suit filed by the appellant i.e. O.S. No. 10 of 2003 on contest and
decreed the suit (O.S. No. 9 of 2003) filed by the respondent, on

                                     6
contest.    Consequently the trial court directed grant of letters of
administration in favour of the present respondent, who was the
plaintiff in O.S. No. 9 of 2003 with a copy of the Will under Ext. 1 in
respect of the property as mentioned in the schedule of the said Will.
The appellant being aggrieved has preferred both the aforesaid
appeals against the common judgment.
10.           The above findings, when juxtaposed with the evidence
on record, it would be found that D.W. 1 examined on behalf of the
appellant made the statement that Major Miss Sybil Holmes was very
much concerned about the orphans and destitute children. She was
paying the money and Sangram Sir (P.W. 1) was looking after the
management and the testatrix was thinking to dispose of her
property in favour of orphans and Sangram Sir was assisting the
testatrix in this regard.
11.           D.W. 4 in his cross-examination has stated that it is
clear that testatrix had the intention to dispose of all her movable
and immovable properties in favour of orphanage only and not for
any other purpose. D.W. 1 in his cross-examination has stated that
each year the respondent was hosting the National Flag where the
orphans used to come. He further stated that Sybil was suffering
from paralysis.      Sangram Sir was bringing medicine for her and
bringing vegetables etc. We were taking salaries from Sangram Babu.
She was paying the money and Sangram Sir was looking after the
management. Sangram Sir was assisting the testatrix in this regard.

                                     7
12.          The appellant in her deposition has stated that her
qualification is matric fail.   She was reading in Ravenshaw Girls’
High School.     She had taken training for dresser in Cuttack City
Hospital but has not filed the training certificate.     She was not
reading in Nursing School or College. She is not a trained nurse.
However, in the Will under Ext. A, though the appellant who was the
allegedly propounder/legatee was described as a professional and
trained nurse in her plaint but during her examination as witness,
she deposed to be a ‘Dresser’ by profession and not to be a nurse.
She has further stated in her cross-examination that she joined with
the testatrix in the year, 1985 and was attending the testatrix to look
after her ailing health as paid employee at Rs. 400/- per month as
salary.
13.          The respondent produced Ext. 2 dated 19.7.1985, which
is also a registered Will in favour of the respondent and two others,
and was cancelled by the testatrix by executing a fresh Will (Ext. 1).
Exts. 3 to 20 are documents, which indicate about the past service
and position of the testatrix and also proves that after her death, an
orphanage with the name and style of “Sybel Memorial Children’s
Home” is running over the bequeathed property being managed by
the present respondent. The appellant only filed one document i.e.
the alleged Will under Ext. A.
14.          D.W. 4 Bina Behera, in her evidence during cross-
examination has stated that Ext. 2 is a registered document and has

                                     8
remained unchallenged. In para-3 and 4 of Ext. 2, the intention of
the testatrix is disclosed.    The testatrix has stated that all her
properties shall belong to orphans and destitute children’s Home,
which she wished, should be started after her in the name and style
of ‘Sybil Memorial Children’s Home’.     To build such an institution
was her long cherished hope as she has given her life and blood for
orphans and also she was deeply concerned about the future of such
orphans of this vast country. It was her desire that this children’s
home should live and grow and take care of the orphans.
15.         Ext. 1 is in conformity to Ext. 2 which discloses her
intention. It is stated in Ext. 1 that all her properties mentioned in
Schedule-A, B & C of the Will, Sri Sangram Keshari Nayak is to start
one orphanage for the orphans and destitute children in the name
and style of ‘Sybil Memorial Children’s Home’ in the house of the
testatrix more fully described in Schedule-C which is her life’s desire
and she has given her life and blood to the orphans and she is deeply
concerned about their future.      She has further stated that all her
properties will go to Sri Sangram Keshari Nayak who will run ‘Sybil
Memorial Children’s Home’ and this will be managed by her executor
Sri Sangram Keshari Nayak to the best of his ability.
            To avoid mis-utilization of her property in other manner,
she has given a protective warning that her executor (Sangram
Keshari Nayak) shall not sale or mortgage the property in any other
manner.

                                       9
16.           From a bare reading of the contents of Exts. 1 and 2 and
disposition of D.W. 4, it is clear that the testatrix had a mind to
dispose of all her properties for the purpose of running an orphanage
under the management of Sri Sangram Keshari Nayak for the
orphans and destitute children of the country and not for any other
purpose. To bequeath her property for personal use and benefit and
gain was contrary to her last wish and desire.
17.           Due Execution and attestation of the Will.
              To prove due execution and attestation of a ‘Will’, the
relevant provision is laid down under Section 63 of the Indian
Succession Act and Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act.
              Section 68 of the Evidence Act provides that a ‘Will’
compulsorily is to be attested. Section 63 of the Indian Succession
Act further provides that the ‘Will’ is compulsorily to be attested by at
least two or more witnesses. These provisions/requirements must be
satisfactorily proved by the party who claims probate. For execution
and attestation, the propounder of the ‘will’ has to prove that there
are two witnesses who saw the testatrix sign in the Will and the
attesting witnesses have signed the ‘Will’ in presence of the testatrix.
              When we examine Ext. 1 in the aforesaid pari materia, it
is seen that the testatrix as well as the two attesting witnesses have
signed in presence of each other.          In page-4 of Ext. 1, the
executant/testatrix has certified that she has executed her last ‘Will’
and testament in presence of attesters Rashmi Ranjan Sahu and

                                       10
Sridhar Das, who have seen her executing the ‘Will’ and have signed
in her presence. The two attesters have also certified that they have
witnessed the execution of the Will by Miss. Sybil Holmes and signed
in her presence.
18.          This aspect has also been clearly proved from the
depositions of P.Ws.1 and 3 being stated in their cross-examination
in the following manner:
             P.W. 2 has stated that at the time of execution of Ext.1,
P.W. 1, Sridhar Das, Bina Behera, Advocate A.K. Rao and Typist R.K.
Barik were there. The testatrix signed the Will first and then P.W. 2
Sridhar Das and Bina Behera signed thereon. The testatrix signed
first and then the attesting witnesses signed.
             From the affidavit and the aforesaid evidence of P.Ws. 2
and 3, it can safely be concluded that Ext. 1 has been duly executed,
attested and fulfilled all the conditions required by law. On the other
hand, Ext. A does not disclose the names of the attesting witnesses
from out of all those witnesses who signed it.
             Daitari Mohapatra, who has been examined as D.W. 2,
claims to be the only attesting witness in Ext. A. His evidence is full
of doubtful circumstances. He is an interested witness since he was
the home tutor of the son of Bidulata Mohanty.        He has not stated
nor it is known as to who is the other attesting witness in Ext. A.
None of the other witnesses of Ext. A has come forward to depose
that he is the second attesting witness.        In absence of another

                                      11
attesting witness neither known nor examined, the requirement of
Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act is not complied. The Will
attested by only one attesting witness is invalid and inoperative in
the eye of law. Probate cannot be granted in such a case and prayer
is bound to fail. So, it can safely be concluded that Ext. A has not
been duly executed, attested or proved. Probate of Ext. A is liable to
be refused on this score alone.
19.          Vicious and suspicious circumstances of the Will
             Suspicious circumstances in a Will are the questions of
fact and cannot be accurately defined.       The court is to scan the
documents and come to the conclusion whether the suspicious
circumstance is of such nature that it would be sufficient to refuse
probate of the Will. Ext. 1 is free from any doubtful circumstance of
any manner. The hostile evidence of D.W. 4, Bina Behera, cannot be
coloured to be suspicious circumstance.        It is not unusual that
during evidence, many witnesses turn hostile and depose falsehood
in evidence. Bina Behera is no exception to this. The evidence of
Bina Behera (D.W.4) goes to show that she is a liar out and out,
though she has stated that she is illiterate and do not know reading
and writing in her cross-examination, she has stated “I was born in
April, 1934. Now I am not able to read Bible since last 17 to 18 years
as I am not able to see properly”.
             From her aforesaid statements, it can safely be inferred
that D.W. 4 is a literate lady who is able to read Bible 17 to 18 years

                                     12
back, admitted that her signature which she was unable to see and
tell her date of birth according to English calendar.  Her intention of
turning hostile and deposing falsehood is clear from her statement,
where she admitted that she has not understood the contents of the
affidavit and could not say who prepared that and on whose instance
or instruction, the affidavit is prepared. She further told that she
came to the court as a witness to get a piece of land situated towards
the backside of the case land and further deposed that the asbestos
room should be given to her. The hostility of such interested witness
cannot make the Will inoperative. The court is not powerless in such
a case. The court can look to the whole circumstances of the case
and come to the conclusion that the formalities/provisions of law
have been complied and in such event, the court can allow the
probate of Will basing upon the evidence of witnesses and
documents.
20.           On the other hand, Ext. A          is surrounded with
suspicious circumstances inherent in it and the propounder has not
explained those vicious circumstances to the satisfaction of the
court.    Some of the suspicious circumstances in Ext. A are as
follows:
             Language of the Will
             When it is the admitted case that the testatrix had no
knowledge of Oriya, was reading in foreign country, making
correspondence in English and could be able to only speak Oriya to

                                      13
some extent, her intention to scribe the Will in Oriya by an
unqualified Advocate’s Clerk of Bidulata Mohanty is a grave
suspicious circumstance, not explained by the propounder. It is
certified below Ext. A    by the scribe that the testatrix herself read
Ext. A drafted in Oriya which is impossible and can never be correct.
              Absence of a second attesting witness
              Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act provides for two
attesting witnesses to sign the document and to be examined as
witnesses. This requirement of law is not fulfilled. Surprisingly in
Ext. A, it is not specifically mentioned nor in evidence adduced, any
of the D.Ws. deposed as to who is the second attesting witness of the
Will.
              Bidulata has examined three witnesses out of which she
herself is not a signatory to the Will.      D.W. 3 is the scribe who
admitted that he is not an attesting witness. In such circumstances,
D.W. 2 if accepted as attesting witness, there is absence of a second
attesting witness. The prayer to probate Ext. A is bound to fail since
the provision of law has not been complied with for absence of a
second attesting witness.
              Section 281 of the Indian Succession Act has not been
complied as the provision prescribes that where the application is for
probate, the petition shall be verified by at least one of the witnesses.
              D.W. 1 in para-34 in her cross-examination has
admitted that her plaint (petition for probate in O.S. No. 10 of 2003)

                                    14
does not contain the attestation/verification of any witness though
they know about the filing of the case.       From her statement, it
reveals that the witnesses of Ext. A are available and procurable. In
absence of compliance of the provisions laid down in Section 281, the
application is incomplete and cannot be probated.     The propounder
has no explanation to such non-compliance.
21.          From the above discussion, it is clear that the trial court
has rightly appreciated the evidence adduced before it both oral and
documentary to come to the conclusion that Ext. 1 is a genuine Will
executed in favour of the respondent and the Will under Ext. A is
shrouded by suspicion.     Hence, the conclusion of the trial court
cannot be faulted with in these appeals.
22.           In the result, therefore, both the FAOs, accordingly,
stand dismissed, but in the circumstances, parties shall bear their
own cost.
                                         …………………..
