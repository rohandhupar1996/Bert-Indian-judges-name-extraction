                            For the respondents: Mr. R. Mazumdar, Standing Counsel

                            Date of Judgment:       01-09-2015
                                   JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
                       This   writ  petition  filed  by  seven    petitioners  is about
                regularisation of their services against the posts of Assistant
                Teachers of L.P. Schools of Assam. The petitioners belong to Nalbari
                District of Assam.
                2.     The case of the petitioners is that an advertisement was
                issued    on   28-12-1996    inviting   applications    from  interested
                candidates for filling up the posts of Assistant Teachers for L.P.
                Schools under the Department of Elementary Education, Assam:
                they duly applied for the posts. In terms of the letter dated 8-3-2001
                of the State Government, a total number of 7066 posts was said to
                have been created, out of which 436 posts were allotted for L.P.
                Schools while 2690 posts were earmarked for M.E. Schools. The
                petitioners claim that 350 posts were thus allotted for regularization
                of the service of 350 L.P. School Teachers and that they were
                interviewed by a duly constituted Interview Board whereafter they
                were merit-wise placed in Serial No. 1 to 7 of the list. They were
                thereafter appointed as Assistant Teachers by the concerned Deputy
                Inspector of Schools for different L.P. Schools under his jurisdiction
                in a fixed pay of ₹1,800/- per month against the validly created
                posts and were allotted to these schools by the Government. It is said
                that all the appointments were initially made on 16-3-2001 on
                temporary basis but their services were utilized by the respondent
                authorities from time to time without any break. The concerned
                Deputy Inspector of Schools had submitted on 16-7-2003 a report to
                the respondent No. 2 categorically stating therein that 280 selected
                candidates had been appointed against 280 one year sanctioned
WP(C) No. 5365/2010                                                                Page 2 of 8

                posts as per the select list submitted by the Advisory Board and that
                the list of 15 teachers for Barkhetri Constituency consisted of the
                names of the petitioners. However, due to the allegations of
                anomalies in the appointment of OBB teachers, the Governor of
                Assam constituted a Committee to make inquiry for identifying those
                genuine teachers who were appointed in March, 2001 under the
                O.B.B. Scheme against 280 posts of L.P. Schools of Nalbari District
                vide the order dated 11-3-2010 issued by the Under Secretary,
                Education, Assam. Though the Committee was to submit the
                authenticated report to the Government within 31st May, 2010, but
                no positive action has been taken by the Government for regular
                appointment of the genuinely appointed O.B.B. Teachers. On the
                retirement of the then Chairman of the Committee, the Government
                re-constituted an Inquiry Committee vide the order dated 11-8-2010.
                During the proceeding of the earlier Committee held on 6-1-2010,
                according to the petitioners, the Committee found that in respect of
                Barkhetri Constituency, out of 67 teachers of the approved list, only
                26 appointment letters were available as communicated by the then
                Chairman vide his letter dated 15-2-2010. As all the petitioners were
                duly selected, and their names were listed as duly appointed against
                one year O.B.B. sanctioned posts in terms of the Inquiry Report
                submitted by the D.I. of Schools to the respondent No. 2, they are
                entitled to regularization of their services. The petitioners further
                submit that in view of the order dated 12-12-2007 passed by this
                Court in WP(C) No. 8299/04, the respondent authorities have taken
                action for regularisation of the duly appointed O.B.B. Teachers, who
                were appointed in the year 2001. However, the petitioners are
                apprehending that their services may not be regularised as they were
                not parties to WP(C) No. 8299/04 even though they are similarly
                situated with the petitioners therein, who were also appointed in the
                year 2001 under the O.B.B. Scheme. The petitioners are now
                claiming similar direction in this writ petition. These are the sum and
                substance of the case of the petitioners.
WP(C) No. 5365/2010                                                                Page 3 of 8

                3.      The writ petition is opposed by the State respondents, who
                have filed their counter-affidavit through the respondent No. 1. It is
                the case of the answering respondent that the appointments of the
                petitioners were made in gross violation of the established procedure
                for making appointments and were in excess of the available
                vacancies. Due to large-scale illegal appointments, it is virtually
                impossible for the respondent authorities to identify the genuinely
                selected candidates. In fact, in Nalbari district alone, as against the
                available 266 vacancies for L.P. Schools, 4,510 appointments were
                made by the then District Elementary Education Officer of the
                district, who also appointed 419 candidates against the vacant posts
                of L.P. Schools. According to the answering respondent, as it was not
                physically possible to determine as to who is an illegal appointee or
                not in the Nalbari district, the Government issued the order dated 4-
                7-2001 directing the respondent No. 2 to cancel all those illegal
                appointments. The respondent No. 2 accordingly issued the order
                dated 19-7-2001 directing the DEEO, Nalbari district to cancel all
                the appointments made by then incumbent, namely, Sri A.C.
                Choudhury,     DEEO,    Nalbari.   This   resulted  in  cancelling   the
                appointments of all those teachers appointed under the 7066 OBB
                Scheme in the month of March, 2001 in the month of July, 2001. As
                they approached this Court for regularization of their services and
                payment of salaries after a delay of 9 years without satisfactory
                explanation, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground
                of laches.
                4.      Some   of  the   aggrieved    teachers   whose   services   were
                terminated by the orders dated 19-7-2001 and 21-7-2001 had
                approached this Court in WP(C) No. 6469/2001, but the writ petition
                was disposed of by directing the State-respondents to initiate an
                enquiry in order to determine the genuineness of the select list.
                Thereafter, Magisterial enquiry was conducted whereafter the report
                of   the   enquiry  was    submitted.    The   State-respondents    also
                constituted the Enquiry Committee to study the matter, and the
                Committee prima facie found that vital documents such as the select
WP(C) No. 5365/2010                                                                Page 4 of 8

                list, the appointment letters, issue registers, the meeting proceeding
                books of the Selection Board and files dealing with the appointment
                of teachers to the posts allotted under the scheme of OBB (7066) in
                March, 2001 were not found in perfect order. The State-respondents
                again, in compliance with the judgment and order dated 12-12-2007
                passed in WP(C) No. 8299/2004 (Md. Saher Ali & ors vs. State of
                Assam & ors), re-constituted an enquiry committee under the
                Chairmanship of answering respondent to verify the genuineness of
                the appointments made in March, 2001 under OBB (7066) Scheme
                in Nalbari by the Deputy Commissioner, Nalbari on 4-8-2010. On
                verification, the Enquiry Committee found such appointments to be
                doubtful. After cancellation of these appointment orders and the
                subsequent termination, some similarly situated LP School Teachers
                of Nalbari District had approached this Court in WP(C) No.
                4560/2008 (Pabitra Barman and ors. v. State of Assam) seeking a
                direction to the respondents to allow them to work as Assistant
                Teachers and for payment of salaries. This Court dismissed the writ
                petition on the ground that the services of the petitioners had been
                terminated way back in 2001. This Court also dismissed another
                similar writ petition being WP(C) No. 5541/2010 (Pratap Kalita & ors.
                v. State of Assam) vide the order dated 4-10-2010 in terms of the
                aforesaid order dated 21-11-2008. Similarly situated teachers who
                were appointed as M.E. school teachers in the year 2001 in respect of
                Nalbari district had approached this Court in WP(C) No. 6241/11
                (Kamal Chandra Das & ors. v. State of Assam & ors) challenging
                their terminations dated 19-7-2001 and 21-7-2001 as well as the
                Enquiry Report dated 13-8-2010, but this Court dismissed the writ
                petition on 20-5-2014. These are the sum and substance of the case
                of the respondent authorities.
                5.      After hearing the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
                and on perusing the pleadings of the parties, I have no doubt in my
                mind that this writ petition suffers from gross laches. If any authority
                is needed, I may conveniently refer to the decision of the Apex Court
WP(C) No. 5365/2010                                                               Page 5 of 8

                   in S.S. Balu v. State of Kerala, (2009) 2 SCC 479, which are in
                   the following terms:
                               “17. It is also well-settled principle of law that “delay
                           defeats equity”. The Government Order was issued on 15-1-
                           2002. The appellants did not file any writ application
                           questioning the legality and validity thereof. Only after the writ
                           petitions filed by others were allowed and the State of Kerala
                           preferred an appeal thereagainst, they impleaded themselves
                           as party-respondents. It is now a trite law that where the writ
                           petitioner approaches the High Court after a long delay, reliefs
                           prayed for may be denied to them on the ground of delay and
                           laches irrespective of the fact that they are similarly situated
                           to the other candidates who obtain the benefit of the
                           judgment. It is, thus, not possible for us to issue any direction
                           to the State of Kerala or the Commission to appoint the
                           appellants at this stage. In NDMC v. Pan Singh9 this Court
                           held: (SCC p. 283, para 16)
                               “16. There is another aspect of the matter which cannot be
                           lost sight of. The respondents herein filed a writ petition after
                           17 years. They did not agitate their grievances for a long time.
                           They, as noticed herein, did not claim parity with the 17
                           workmen at the earliest possible opportunity. They did not
                           implead themselves as parties even in the reference made by
                           the State before the Industrial Tribunal. It is not their case
                           that after 1982, those employees who were employed or who
                           were recruited after the cut-off date have been granted the
                           said scale of pay. After such a long time, therefore, the writ
                           petitions could not have been entertained even if they are
                           similarly situated. It is trite that the discretionary jurisdiction
                           may not be exercised in favour of those who approach the
                           court after a long time. Delay and laches are relevant factors
                           for exercise of equitable jurisdiction.”

  (2007) 9 SCC 278
WP(C) No. 5365/2010                                                                     Page 6 of 8

                6.      In the instant case, though the petitioners claim regularization
                of their services, the stance taken by the respondent authorities in
                their affidavit filed on 3-8-2015 is that the appointments of teachers
                under the 7066 OBB Scheme are illegal being made without the
                approval of the higher authorities and beyond the available
                vacancies; that the Deputy Commissioner, Nalbari enquired into the
                matter and, seized the original documents on 24-4-2001, submitted
                his report on 11-6-2001, but as it was not physically possible to
                identify as to who were the genuine appointees or who were not
                among the large-scale appointments under the said Scheme during
                that period, necessary directions had to be issued to the answering
                respondents for mass cancellation of such appointments, which was
                done in the month of July, 2001. According to the answering
                respondents, some of the terminated teachers had approached this
                Court in WP(C) No. 6469/01, which, as already noticed, resulted in
                the constitution of enquiry committee by the State-respondents to
                verify the genuineness of such appointments made in March, 2001
                under the OBB Scheme. No reply-affidavit is filed by the petitioners
                to challenge these averments made by the respondents in their
                counter. If the appointments of the petitioners had been cancelled in
                2001 as claimed by the respondent authorities and if there is no
                evidence to show that they had been reinstated to their services in
                the meantime, the question of regularization of their services will not
                and cannot arise: to seek such a relief will amount to putting the cart
                before the horse. Assuming that some of the terminated teachers
                have obtained some favourable orders from this Court also, the
                petitioners are guilty of laches for sitting idly for 9 long years. No
                satisfactory explanation is offered by them for the inordinate delay in
                filing this writ petition after 9 years. They were filing this writ petition
                only after other petitioners succeed. They were not vigilant but were
                content to be dormant and shoes to sit on the fence till somebody
                else case came to be decided. Their case cannot be considered on the
                analogy of one where a law had declared unconstitutional and void
                by a court so as to enable persons to recover money paid under the
WP(C) No. 5365/2010                                                                   Page 7 of 8

                compulsion of the law declared void.─ See Rup Diamond v. Union of
                India, (1989) 2 SCC 356.
                7.     For what has been stated in the foregoing, there is no merit in
                this writ petition, which is hereby dismissed. However, the parties
                are directed to bear their respective costs.
