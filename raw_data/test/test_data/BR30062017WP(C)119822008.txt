           P R E S E N T:
                      THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH
Biswanath Rath,J.    In this writ petition, the petitioner has made the following prayer:
                            “It is therefore prayed that the writ petition may be
                    admitted, records of OSATIP Case No.119/2004 in the file
                    of opp. party No.2 and the records of Certificate Case
                    No.31/78 (L.R.) and the records of Certificate Case
                    No.68/78(LR) in the file of opp.party No.3 may be called
                    for,
                                                 And
                             After hearing the counsel for the petitioner the writ
                   petition may be allowed and the impugned order dated
                   26.3.2008 passed by opp.party No.2 in OSATIP Case
                   No.119/2004 under Annexure-4 may be quashed,
           2.       In assailing the aforesaid impugned orders, Sri Nanda, learned
           counsel appearing for the petitioner raises the following grounds:

                                        2
           (a)    In view of the transaction of the land involving
           Scheduled Tribe by the State in favour of the
           petitioner involving certificate proceeding due to non-
           payment of the loan dues of the public financial
           institution, initiation of the proceeding under Section
           32 of Regulation 2 of 1956 is itself bad;
           (b)    Sri Nanda also raised that since the proceeding
           was initiated under Section 3 (2) of Regulation 2 of
           1956 , reading the provisions contained in “Section 3
           (2) read with Section 3(1), it was incumbent upon the
           authority taking of the Regulation 2 proceeding to
           take a decision referring to first proviso of Section 3
           Sub-Section(1). In absence of these, the impugned
           order under Annexure-6 cannot be sustained.
3.         From the documents involved in the case, this Court finds that
the Scheduled Tribe persons admittedly availed the loan from the public
financial institution. For non-payment of loan dues, OPDR proceedings
were initiated against the Scheduled Tribe Persons resulting Certificate
Proceedings and Certificate Proceedings were concluded by court auction
and after obtaining necessary permission from the competent authority.
Consequent upon issuance of certificate of sale in favour of the petitioner,
record-of-right was also prepared, as appearing at Annexure-1 and it is at
this stage of the matter and after a long gap of 25 years, a suo motu
proceeding under Regulation 2 of 1956 applying the provision under
Section 3 (2) of the Regulation 2 was initiated. Regulation 2 proceeding
initiated suo motu was registered as OSATIP Case No.119/2004 and this

                                     3
matter was disposed of against the petitioner holding that the sale
transaction has been effected in non-compliance of the provision
contained in Section 3(1) of the Regulation 2 of 1956. Referring to the
impugned order and drawing this Courts attention to the provision under
Section 3 of the Regulation 2 of 1956, Sri Nanda, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner contended that there has been no proper
appreciation of first proviso involving Section 3(1) and therefore, the
impugned order cannot be sustained. Sri Nanda, learned counsel also
raises    dispute with regard to the limitation on the premises that the
Regulation 3 proceeding having been initiated after long lapse of time for
which the proceeding is also otherwise not maintainable. It is in these
premises, Sri Nanda, learned counsel prayed for setting aside the
impugned order under Annexure-4 and thereby confirming the sale
transaction in favour of the petitioner.
4.          Sri Behera, learned        State Counsel    on the other hand
defending the impugned order submitted that for the facts disclosed
therein in the impugned order, the auction involving the disputed property
taken place on 29.2.1980 and there being no prior approval, there has
been clear violation of the provision contained in Section 3 of the
Regulation 2 of 1956 and therefore, there is no illegality or impropriety in
the impugned order and thus prayed for rejection of the writ petition for
having no merit.
5.      Considering the rival contentions of the parties, this Court finds that
there is no dispute that the petitioner has purchased the disputed property
belonging to a Scheduled Tribe in a certificate proceeding arising out of a
proceeding under OPDR Act.          Be that as it may, the question that is

                                       4
required     to be decided here as to whether the sale in favour of the
petitioner in fact is contravenes the provision under Section 3 of the
Regulation 2, 1956 or not? Considering the admitted position indicated
hereinabove, this Court now moves to consider the aforesaid question
taking into consideration the provision contained in Section 3 of the
Regulation, 1956. Section 3 of the Regulation 2 of 1956, as amended, is
applicable to the case involving the sale certificate in the year,1982.
6.         Section 3 of the Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable
Property (By Scheduled Tribes) Regulation, 1956 reads as follows:
             3. Transfer of immovable property by a member of
        Scheduled Tribe- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in
        any law for the time being in force any transfer of immovable
        property situated within a Scheduled Area by a member of
        a Scheduled Tribe shall be absolutely null and void and of no
        force or effect whatsoever unless made in favour of another
        member of a Scheduled Tribe or with the previous consent in
        writing of the competent authority:
             [Provided    that nothing in this Sub-section shall apply to
        any Transfer by way of mortgage executed in favour of any
        public financial institution for securing a loan granted by such
        institution for any agricultural purpose]:
         Looking to the first proviso attached to Section 3(1) of the
Regulation 2 of 1956, it makes clear            that the condition attached in
Section 3(1) of Regulation 1 of 1956 will have no application in the event
the property of a Scheduled Tribe mortgaged in favour of public financial
institution for securing loan granted by such institution for agricultural

                                        5
purpose.        From the fact scenario, it appears that the land         originally
belong to Scheduled Tribe and it is submitted by learned counsel for the
petitioner that the land remain in agriculture status and reading of the
entire pleadings as well as the impugned order, this Court is unable to find
out as to purpose of the loan. This Court also finds the authority deciding
the matter in OSATIP Case No.119/2004 has not considered this aspect of
the matter and it appears that the authority has totally lost sight of the first
proviso appended to Section 3(1) of the Regulation 2 of 1956.
7.               Under the circumstance, this Court finds t the impugned order
runs contrary to provision contained in Regulation 2 of 1956 and the
matter is remitted back to the Sub-Collector, Gunupur to rehear the matter
involving OSATIP Case No.119/2004 and decide the case on the issues
framed thereunder involving the provision contained in first proviso and
take a fresh decision in the matter giving opportunity of hearing to the
present petitioner and also to the State authority further after calling for the
relevant documents from the           State custody.    Petitioner is directed to
appear before the Sub-Collector, Gunupur along with certified copy of this
order on 21.7.2017 enabling the Collector to proceed in the matter.
               Parties are to bear their respective costs.
                                                   ………………………………
