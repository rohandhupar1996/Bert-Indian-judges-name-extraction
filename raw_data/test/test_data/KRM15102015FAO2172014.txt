        P R E S E N T:
                    THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE K.R. MOHAPATRA
             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
K.R. Mohapatra, J.           Order dated 31.01.2014 passed by the learned Civil
        Judge (Senior Division), Champua in CMA No.45 of 2013 arising out
        of CS No.61 of 2013 rejecting an application under Order 39 Rules 1
        and 2 of C.P.C. filed by the plaintiff is under challenged in this
        appeal.
        2.              Civil Suit No.61 of 2013 has been filed for declaration
        and permanent injunction. The dispute is in respect of a 30 feet wide
        road connecting Roida-I iron ore mines with NH 215 running through

                                   2
the leasehold area of in Roida-II iron ore mines of the sole defendant
(for short, ‘the suit road’).
              Case of the plaintiff in brief is that defendant was the
lessee in respect of Roida-I and Roida-II iron ore mines since
23.01.1953. The said lease was for thirty years, i.e., up to
22.01.1983. First renewal of mining lease was granted in favour of
the defendant in respect of both Roida-I and Roida-II iron ore mines
for a period of 20 years, i.e., from 23.01.1983 to 22.01.2003. On
16.09.1994, the defendant made an application under Rule 37 of the
Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 (‘Rules 1960’ for short) for transfer
of the mining lease of Roida-I iron ore mines in favour of the plaintiff
for the remaining period of the lease. On 20.05.1996, the Central
Government conveyed its approval for transfer of Roida-I in favour of
the plaintiff. Accordingly, the transfer deed in Form ‘O’ was executed
between the plaintiff, the defendant and Government of Odisha on
31.10.1996 for the remaining period, i.e., up to 22.01.2003. Clause-6
of the deed of transfer stipulates that all the rights and interests in
the original mining lease in respect of Roida-I iron ore mines was
transferred to the plaintiff on the same terms and conditions as was
prevailing. Before expiry of the period of lease, the plaintiff submitted
an application for second renewal on 25.11.2002 under Section 8(3)
of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957
(for short, ‘MMDR Act’) and as per the provisions of Rule 24A(6) of
the Rules, 1960, the mining lease was deemed to have been

                                   3
extended. As such, the plaintiff continued to carry out mining
operation. It is contended by the plaintiff that in the year 1997, the
defendant blocked the suit road which was reported to the Deputy
Director of Mines, Joda. Deputy Director of Mines, Joda vide order
dated 20.05.1997, directed the defendant to allow access for
movement of carriers of the plaintiff on the suit road. Again on
27.11.2013, the defendant attempted to block the suit road
disrupting the mining activities and lodged an FIR against the
officials of the plaintiff. Hence, the suit was filed for the aforesaid
relief. Reiterating the assertions made in the plaint, the plaintiff filed
CMA No.45 of 2013 for an order of     temporary injunction restraining
the defendant and any other person claiming under it from creating
any type of blockage over the suit road and interference with the
peaceful use of the suit road by the plaintiff till disposal of the suit.
3.            The defendant on appearance filed its show cause
though admitting the lease of Roida-I mines in favour of the plaintiff
with effect from 31.10.1996, but refuted the existence of the suit
road and its use by the plaintiff. It is contended by the defendant
that the suit road existed prior to the transfer of the mining lease of
Roida-I iron ore mines in favour of the plaintiff, but the same is no
more in existence. As the said area upon which the suit road existed
is under the operational area to carry out the mining activities as per
the mining plan approved by the competent authority, i.e., Indian
Bureau of Mines (IBM), access through the operational area of Roida-

                                    4
II mines, as claimed by the plaintiff, is not permissible under law.
The defendant further contended that the plaintiff had no access to
the suit road through Roida-II iron ore mines at any point of time
since the date of transfer made in October, 1996. Though the
plaintiff had made a complaint before the DDM, Joda regarding
alleged refusal of the defendant for an access of the plaintiff through
Roida-II mines in the year 1997, the DDM, Joda only made a request
to allow access for movement of carriers through the suit road, since
such an arrangement was not viable in terms of the provisions under
the MMDR Act as well as the Rules made there under, the request
was never heeded to by the defendant. From the date of transfer of
the mining lease in favour of the plaintiff in respect of Roida-I iron
ore mines, it has been using the road running from pillar No.29 to
have an access to NH 215, which is apparent from the contentions of
the plaintiff in W.P.(C) Nos. 1402 of 2011 and 23722 of 2011 in
relation to the user of their existing road and on the basis of such
contention and pleadings, interim orders were passed in favour of the
plaintiff. It was the further case of the defendant that when the
plaintiff faced difficulty in using the road from pillar No.29 to NH 215
they attempted to construct a road from pillar No.21-A in Roida-II
iron ore mines of the defendant for an approach to NH 215 on or
about 06.07.2011, which was objected to by the defendant. The
defendant lodged a complaint before the Forest Range Officer and in
response thereto a notice to show cause was issued to the plaintiff

                                    5
vide Memo No.831 dated 21.07.2011. Thereafter, the plaintiff keeping
silence over the matter for some time, again on or about 28.11.2013
as well as 16.12.2013 attempted to trespass into the defendant’s
leasehold area and cause obstruction in the mining activities for
which an FIR was lodged against the plaintiff in Barbil Police Station
and a criminal proceeding was initiated against the plaintiff. Thus,
the defendant claimed that the plaintiff had neither any locus standi
nor any cause of action to file the petition for temporary injunction.
The same is also not maintainable in the eye of law and facts. As
such, the defendant prayed for dismissal of the same.
4.           Learned     Trial    Court    while    holding    that   the
plaintiff/appellant has prima facie case, came to a conclusion that
the question of plaintiff’s suffering irreparable loss does arise and the
balance of convenience leans in favour of the defendant. Accordingly,
he dismissed the petition vide order dated 31.01.2014, which is
under challenge in this appeal.
5.           Learned counsel for the plaintiff/appellant reiterating
the pleadings in the plaint submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in W.P.(C) No.114 of 2014 held that the provision of deemed
renewal in Rule 24A(6) of the Rules, 1960 is not available for the
second and subsequent renewals of mining lease considering the
language of Section 8(3) of the MMDR Act. Accordingly, vide Gazette
Notification dated 18.07.2014, the Central Government amended
Rule 24A(6) of Rules 1960 stating that the provision of sub-rule (6)

                                  6
was not applicable to renewal under sub-Section (3) of Section 8 of
the MMDR Act. Thus, the deemed extension of Roida-I iron ore mines
in favour of the plaintiff came to an end on 18.07.2014. However, the
Government     of   India   promulgated   the  Mines   and   Minerals
(Development     and    Regulation)   Amendment     Ordinance,  2015
published in Gazette of India on 12.01.2015 and subsequently,
Section 8 of the MMDR Act was amended and it was published in the
Gazette of India on 27.03.2015. Section 8A(6) of the MMDR
Amendment Act, 2015 provided as under:-
         8A(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
         sections (2), (3) and sub-section (4), the period of
         lease granted before the date of commencement of the
         Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)
         Amendment Act, 2015, where mineral is used for
         other than captive purpose, shall be extended and be
         deemed to have been extended up to a period ending
         on the 31st March, 2020 with effect from the date of
         expiry of the period of renewal last made or till the
         completion of renewal period, if any, or a period of
         fifty years from the date of grant of such lease,
         whichever is later, subject to the condition that all
         the terms and conditions of the lease have been
         complied with.
 Pursuant to the amended provision of Section 8A(6) of the MMDR
Amendment Act, 2015, the mining lease in respect of Roida-I iron ore
mines stood extended in favour of the plaintiff till 31.03.2020.
Accordingly, the State Government granted extension of the period of
mining lease in respect of Roida-I mines from 22.01.2003 to
31.03.2020. He further contented that the lease was extended up to
2020 on the same terms and conditions as was in existence on the

                                   7
date of transfer, i.e., 31.10.1996. Thus, the plaintiff has the right to
use the suit road for movement of his carrier and for other purposes.
The alleged existence of another road from pillar No.29 was
unauthorized and not approved one. The said road proceeds through
the reserve forest and this Court vide order dated 29.09.2011 directed
the plaintiff/appellant to approach the competent authority for
necessary permission to use the said road from pillar No.29 for access
to NH 215. Pursuant to the direction of this Court, Divisional Forest
Officer, Keonjahr used to grant temporary permissions for use of that
road from time to time. The map attached to the plaint indicates that
the suit road is in existence since 1953 as per the land use plan
approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of
India, New Delhi. The said approved road (suit road) existed prior to
30.10.1996, i.e., from 11.11.194, when the Forest (Conservation) Act,
1980 came into force. Thus, denial of the defendant with regard to
existence of suit road is not correct and is contradictory to the
approved plan of the year 1994 filed along with the plaint. Learned
counsel for the appellant further contented that the learned Trial
Court rejected the interim application only on the ground that the
plaintiff had admitted of road from pillar No.29 as the only road to
approach NH-215. It is his submission that ‘a road’ means a road
lawfully permitted to be used as such. An unlawfully constructed road
cannot be treated to be an alternative road in existence. Moreover,
prosecution    is  pending    against the  plaintiff  for  such   illegal

                                   8
construction of road snitched down near pillar No.29. As such, the
plaintiff has a right of user of the suit road which is existing since
1953 and was being used by the defendant till 1996 and thereafter by
the plaintiff. The plaintiff has been using the said road since 1996 as
the dominant heridtment over the servient heritage for the beneficial
use of enjoyment of the dominant owner. Moreover, in view of the
transfer of lease of Roida-I mines in favour of the defendant in the year
1996, which was valid up to 2003, the plaintiff had the right to use
the suit road as such for the rest of the extended period of lease, i.e.,
up to 2003 and thereafter. Clause-6 of Chapter-III in Form-K under
the Rules 1960 gives a right of use of road to the plaintiff as that of
the original owner. The plaintiff also claims the right of easement over
the suit road. Learned counsel for the appellant further contended
that Clause-6 of Chapter-III of mining lease deed has its source from
Rules 1960. The mining lease deed is a statutory deed and as such
the defendant has no right of denying or obstructing the right of
way/easement. The right of easement created in favour of the plaintiff
cannot be terminated by the defendant because he is only a lessee
and not the owner of the suit road. The plaintiff has no other
approved road except the suit road approved by the Ministry of
Environment and Forest as per the sketch map attached to the plaint
and it only claims to pass through the approved road and not beyond
that. Further, defendant had acquired the prescriptive right by long
use of the road. The plaintiff has a right to access to NH 215 through

                                  9
the suit road even if there exists an alternate road carved out by it.
Learned Court below failed to appreciate that except the suit road, the
plaintiff has no other road for access to NH 215 and by not granting
right of easement or access to NH 215 through the suit road the entire
mining activities of the plaintiff is closed. Three hundred fifty
employees of Roida-I mines would be retrenched and the integrated
steel plant would be shutdown. Thus, he prayed for setting aside the
impugned order as not sustainable in the eye of law and facts.
6.           Mr.Dey, learned counsel for the respondent, on the other
hand, refuted the contentions of learned counsel for the appellant
and submitted that the learned Trial Court has rightly dealt with the
matter in detail and passed the impugned order which needs no
interference by this Court. It is his case that a mining leaseholder
like the present defendant has to carry out the mining operation in
accordance with the Approved Mining Plan (AMP) and in the present
case, the area of Roida-II iron ore mines of the defendant/respondent
upon which the plaintiff claims right of use as a road does not exist
and the same is within the operational area of the mining by the
defendant as per the AMP and the plaintiff cannot be allowed to use
the same as road in view of the provisions of law, more particularly
in view of Rule 22A, Rule 27 (1)(u) of the Rules, 1960 and Rule 13 of
the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988 (for short,
‘Rules 1988’), which read as follows:-

                                  10
         “22A. Mining operations to be in accordance with
         Mining Plans. – (1) Mining operations shall be
         undertaken in accordance with the duly approved
         mining plan.
         (2) Modification of the approved mining plan during
         the operation of a mining lease also requires prior
         approval.”
         Rule 27 (1)(u) of the MC Rules, 1960:-
         “Conditions. –(1) Every mining lease shall be subject
         to the following conditions :
                     xx                  xx                xx
         (u) the lessee shall comply with the Mineral
         Conservation and Development Rules framed under
         section 18.”
         Rule 13 of the Mineral Conservation and
         Development Rules, 1988:-
         “13. Mining operations to be in accordance with
         mining plans : - (1) Every holder of a mining lease
         shall carry out mining operations in accordance with
         the approved mining plan with such conditions as
         may have been prescribed under sub-rule (2) of rule 9
         or with such modifications, if any, as permitted under
         rule 10 or the mining plan or scheme approved under
         rule 11 or 12 as the case may be. (2) If the mining
         operations are not carried out in accordance with the
         mining plan as referred to under sub-rule (1), the
         Regional Controller or the authorised officer may
         order suspension of all or any of the mining
         operations and permit continuance of only such
         operations as may be necessary to restore the
         conditions in the mine as envisaged under the said
         mining plan.”
Thus, allowing such an access, as claimed by the plaintiff, is neither
permissible under law nor on facts, inasmuch as allowing such an
access would result in causing substantial hindrance to the mining
operation of the defendant and it would attract penal provision of
suspension of mining operation as envisaged under Rule 13(2) of

                                    11
Rules, 1988. Moreover, there cannot be a scheduled road in a mining
area. Although declaratory relief of injunction is made in the suit it is
not clear as to whether the plaintiff raises his claim for getting the
relief prayed for in exercise of right of easement or for enforcement of
the terms and conditions of lease agreement. However, the plaintiff is
neither entitled to the relief under easement or for that purpose
enforcing his right over the suit road under the terms and conditions
of the lease agreement. Hence, he claimed that the learned Trial
Court has rightly considered the matter from its proper perspective
and passed the impugned order, which needs no interference and
prayed for dismissal of the appeal.
7.           It is not disputed that the defendant was a lessee in
respect of Roida-I iron ore mines for a period of thirty years from
23.01.1953 to 22.01.1983. The first renewal of the mining lease in
favour of the defendant was granted for a period of twenty years, i.e.,
from 23.01.1983 to 22.01.2003. The defendant / respondent was
also granted lease of Roida-II iron ore mines, which adjoins the
northern and eastern part of Roida-I iron ore mines. While
continuing as such, the defendant transferred the mining lease in
respect of Roida-I iron ore mines in favour of the plaintiff for which
the State Government granted approval in terms of Rule 37 of the
Rules, 1960. A tripartite deed of transfer dated 31.10.1996 was
executed between the defendant as the transferor, plaintiff as the
transferee and the Government of Odisha represented through the

                                  12
Collector, Keonjhar. Upon execution of the deed of transfer, the
plaintiff stood on the footing of the transferor/lessee, i.e., the
defendant, with all rights and liability appended to the said lease in
respect of Roida-I mines on and from 31.10.1996 for the rest of the
period of lease. Prior to such transfer, the defendant, being the
lessee of both Roida-I and Roida-II iron ore mines, for its own
convenience had constructed a road for transporting minerals and
for other ancillary mining activities from Roida-I mines through
Roida-II iron ore mines to get an access to NH 215, which is
apparent from the sketch map of 1994 appended to the plaint and
relied upon by the appellant in course of hearing of this appeal. Prior
to expiry of the lease in respect of Roida-I mines, which was valid up
to 22.01.2003, the plaintiff submitted his second renewal application
on 25.11.2002 under Section 8(3) of the MMDR Act and in view of
the deeming provisions of Rule 24A(6) of the Rules, 1960 (as was
existing then) and pursuant to the operation of amended provisions
of 8A(6) of the MMDR Amended Act, 2015, the lease in respect of
Roida-I mines in favour of the plaintiff is valid up to 31.03.2020.
There is also no dispute to the fact that the plaintiff had filed W.P.(C)
No.1402 of 2011, which was disposed of on 25.01.2011 and W.P.(C)
No.23722 of 2011 (sub judice before this Court), wherein, he has
asserted that the only road for access from Roida-I iron ore mines to
NH 215 is from pillar No.29 of Roida-I mines though Sidha Math
reserve forest, which is being used by the plaintiff from the date of

                                     13
their mining operation and the suit road was constructed in the year
1964. On the basis of such assertion on oath by the plaintiff, interim
order was granted on 29.09.2011 in Misc.           Case Nos. 13641 and
13642 of 2011 arising out of W.P.(C) No.23722 of 2011, which read
as follows:-
                “As an interim measure, it would be just and
           proper for this Court to direct the petitioner-company
           to seek permission from the O.P. No.4 to transport
           the raw materials in the road touching the point
           No.29 which leads to N.H.-215 as has been shown in
           the map without affecting the diversion of forest area
           till the end of October, 2011.”
8.              During course of argument, learned counsel for the
appellant submits that the said road is being used by the plaintiff till
date on temporary permissions. It is also not disputed that the
plaintiff has come up with a definite case in the suit that the suit
road which runs through Roida-II mines is the only road available
for access of the plaintiff to NH-215 from Roida-I mines. However,
learned counsel for the appellant admitting the same contended that
the assertions made in the aforesaid two writ petitions were on a
different context and the road which is existing from pillar No.29 of
Roida-I mines to have an access to NH-215 is an un-approved road
which runs through the reserve forest for which the plaintiff is facing
prosecution. However, Mr.Dey, learned counsel for the respondent
strongly refuting such submission alleges that existence of a relevant
fact will not lose its relevancy, if made, in different context.

                                    14
9.            The plaintiff specifically pleaded in the plaint as well as
in the petition for interim injunction that the plaintiff is using the
suit road from the date of execution of the deed of transfer of lease
dated 31.10.1996 and the same is the only access of the plaintiff to
NH-215. The defendant obstructed the plaintiff from using the suit
road for which the plaintiff represented to the DDM, Joda, who in his
letter dated 20.05.1997, communicated the defendant stating that
the plaintiff has the right and privilege to use the suit road and the
defendant should allow free access for movement of carriers through
the said road over Roida-II iron ore mines under the provisions of
mining lease dead (annexure-3 to the appeal). On perusal of the said
letter, it appears that only a request was made to the defendant to
allow access for free movement of carriers through the existing road
over Roida-II mines under the provisions of the mining lease deed. It
is further contended that the defendant again created obstruction on
27.11.2013 and also filed FIR against the officers of the plaintiff for
disrupting mining activities of the defendant, for which the suit was
filed. The defendant/respondent on the other hand, strongly refuting
such contentions of the plaintiff/appellant submitted that the
plaintiff had never used the suit road for movement of its carriers.
On the other hand, it only used the road starting from pillar No.29 to
NH-215 for its mining activities. This being the factual dispute can
only be adjudicated at the time of trial. However, the fact remains
that the plaintiff with prior permission of the Forest Department is

                                   15
using the road starting from pillar no.29 to have an access to N.H.-
215.
10.           The appellant strongly relied upon Clause-6 of Chapter-
III in Form-K of Rules, 1960, which is the prescribed form of the
mining lease deed and claimed that it has a right to use the suit road
in view of the terms and conditions embodied in the said mining
lease deed. Clause-6 of Chapter-III in Form-K reads as follows:-
          “6.        The lessee/lessees shall allow existing and
          future holders of Government licences or leases over
          any land which is compromised in or adjoins or is
          reached by the land held by the lessee/lessees
          reasonable facilities of access thereto:
                     PROVIDED         THAT      no   substantial
          hindrance or interference shall be caused by such
          holders of licences or leases to the operations of the
          lessee/lessees under these presents and fair
          compensation (as may be mutually agreed upon or in
          the event of disagreement as may be decided by the
          State Government) shall be made to the
          lessee/lessees for loss or damage sustained by the
          lessee/lessees by reason of the exercise of this
          liberty.”
11.           Mr.Dey, learned counsel for the respondents drawing
attention of this Court to the opening words of the said clause
submitted that, the words “the lessee/lessees shall allow…” clearly
indicate that the claim of the appellant is based on the terms of lease
deed and not the deed of transfer (annexure-2 to the appeal). He
further submitted that the benefit granted under Clause-6 for access
over the leasehold area of the respondent is not an absolute privilege
as may be evident from Clasue-6 itself since the same is qualified by

                                  16
the proviso thereto. The said proviso has two limbs, i.e., (i) no
substantial hindrance or interference shall be caused to the
respondent and (ii) a fair compensation (as may be agreed upon by
the parties or in the event of disagreement as may be decided by the
State Government), shall be made to the lessee for the loss or
damage, sustained by the respondent, if any. When no such
compensation is agreed upon between the appellant and the
respondent and/or decided by the Government for alleged use of the
suit road, it is apparent that the said condition was never given
effect to. However, it is a matter of adjudication as to whether there
was any agreement with regard to compensation, as aforesaid and in
that event as decided by the Government as a condition precedent
use of the suit road. Thus, Clause-6 of the lease agreement cannot
be invoked at this stage for adjudication of this Appeal. Moreover, it
is a matter of adjudication as to whether the appellant is entitled to
enforce such a condition of the lease deed against the respondent,
which      is    between    the    State    Government     and     the
defendant/respondent in which the respondent is not a party. It is a
separate matter that no injunction can be granted to prevent breach
of contract.
              In a decision in the case of M.C. Chacko vs. State
Bank of Travancore, Trivandrum, reported in AIR 1970 SC 504,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under:

                                  17
             “…It must therefore be taken as well settled that
         except in the case of a beneficiary under a trust
         created by a contract or in the case of a family
         arrangement, no right may be enforced by a person
         who is not a party to the contract.”
             Thus, in view of the ratio decided by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court (supra), the plaintiff/appellant may not enforce any
right whatsoever conferred by Clause-6 of the lease deed against the
defendant/respondent as he was not a party to the said lease
agreement.
12.          Learned counsel for the appellant, also led his claim
claiming easement over the suit road. Section 4 of the Indian
Easement Act, 1982 read as follows:-
         “4. "Easement" defined.- An easement is a right which
         the owner or occupier of certain land possesses, as
         such, for the beneficial enjoyment of that land, to do
         and continue to do something, or to prevent and
         continue to prevent something being done, in or
         upon, or in respect of, certain other land not his own.
                Dominant and servient heritages and owners.-
         The land for the beneficial enjoyment of which the
         right exists is called the dominant heritage, and the
         owner or occupier thereof the dominant owner; the
         land on which the liability is imposed is called the
         servient heritage, and the owner or occupier thereof
         the servient owner.
                Explanation.- In the first and second clauses of
         this section, the expression "land" includes also
         things permanently attached to the earth; the
         expression "beneficial enjoyment" includes also
         possible convenience, remote advantage, and even a
         mere amenity; and the expression "to do something"
         includes removal and appropriation by the dominant
         owner, for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant
         heritage, of any part of the soil of the servient
         heritage, or anything growing or subsisting thereon.
         Illustrations

                                     18
             (a) A, as the owner of a certain house, has a right
          of way thither over his neighbour B's land for
          purposes connected with the beneficial enjoyment of
          the house. This is an easement.
             (b) A, as the owner of a certain house, has the
          right to go on his neighbour B 's land, and to take
          water for the purposes of his household, out of a
          spring therein. This is an easement.
             (c) A, as the owner of a certain house, has the
          right to conduct water from B 's stream to supply the
          fountains in the garden attached to the house. This is
          an easement.
             (d) A, as the owner of a certain house and farm,
          has the right to graze a certain number of his own
          cattle on B 's field, or to take, for the purpose of being
          used in the house, by himself, his family, guests,
          lodgers and servants, water or fish out of C 's tank, or
          timber out of D 's wood, or to use, for the purpose of
          manuring his land, the leaves which have fallen from
          the trees in E 's land. These are easements.
             (e) A dedicates to the public the right to occupy
          the surface of certain land for the purpose of passing
          and re-passing. This right is not an easement.
             (f) A is bound to cleanse a water course running
          through his land and keep it free from obstruction for
          the benefit of B, a lower riparian owner. This is not
          an easement.”
13.          The definition of easement envisages that a right of
easement can only be claimed over a piece of land if the servient
ownership of which belongs to a person other than the dominant
owner.    On the basis of the aforesaid provision of law, learned
counsel for the plaintiff/appellant resorting to Section 13 of the
Indian Easement Act as well as the deed of transfer under Annexure-
2 to the appeal memo submitted that since Roida-I iron ore mines is
inaccessible except by passing over the suit road over Roida-II mines
which adjoins the Roida-I, the plaintiff is entitled to use the suit road
for movement of its carriers. Resorting to Section 15 of the Indian

                                    19
Easement Act, 1982, he submitted that the plaintiff/appellant has
acquired a right of way over the suit road by prescription. Further,
the use of the suit road would not be prejudicial or affect any
interest of the defendant/respondent. It is the admitted case of the
parties that the appellant started its mining activities over Roida-I
iron ore mines on or after 31.10.1996. Thus, by no stretch of
imagination, it can be said that the plaintiff has acquired a right of
easement by prescription over the suit road as the plaintiff/appellant
has not completed twenty years from the date of commencement of
his mining work. So far as the right of easement of necessity is
concerned, as provided under Section 13 of the Easement Act, it
does not fulfill the requirements provided under Clause-(a) and (b) of
Section 13. For better appreciation, Clause-(a) and (b) of Section 13
of the Easement Act, 1982 is reproduced hereunder:-
        “13. Easements of necessity and quasi easements -
               Where one person transfers or bequeaths
         immovable property to another,-
         (a) if an easement in other immovable property of the
         transferor or testator is necessary for enjoying the
         subject of the transfer or bequest, the transferee or
         legatee shall be entitled to such easement; or
         (b) if such an easement is apparent and continuous
         and necessary for enjoying the said subject as it was
         enjoyed when the transfer or bequest took effect, the
         transferee or legatee shall, unless a different intention
         is expressed or necessarily implied, be entitled to such
         easement; or….”
           Illustration to Clause-(a) and (b), makes it clear that right of
necessity would only arise when the Roida-I iron ore mines becomes
inaccessible except passing over the suit road. It is not disputed by

                                   20
the appellant that in W.P.(C) No.23722 of 2011, he has taken a
specific stand therein that he (appellant) has access to NH-215 from
Roida-I mines through pillar No.29 and the same was            the only
access and is being used as such from the date of commencement of
mining work at Roida-I mines. Learned counsel for the appellant,
however, submitted that such a statement on oath was made before
this Court on a different context. Mr.Dey, learned counsel for the
respondent refuting the same submitted that a statement on oath
does not lose its relevancy irrespective of the context for which it is
made. Moreover, after rejection of the injunction petition, the
plaintiff/appellant filed a petition under Order 6 Rule 17, CPC to
incorporate the pleadings to the effect that existence of the road from
pillar No.29 stated in the writ petitions was on a different context.
The said application was rejected on 24.09.2014 and remained
unchallenged till date. Learned counsel for the appellant does not
dispute this factual aspect in course of his argument.
             From the discussion made above, it is crystal clear that
there is a road existing from pillar No.29 to NH-215 from Roida-I
mines and it is being used as such under temporary permission of
the Forest Department as admitted in course of argument. Thus, the
case of the plaintiff does not fall under Clause-(a) and (b) of Section-
13 of the Easement Act. Section 22 of the Easement Act has no
application to the case at hand, inasmuch as use of suit road would

                                  21
be detrimental to the interest of the defendant/respondent as
contended by him. However, determination of right by easement
needs factual adjudication, which can only be done at the time of
trial.
14.           The decision in the case of Dalpat Kumar And Anr. vs
Prahlad Singh And Ors, reported in AIR 1993 SC 276, is a leading
case where the principles of grant of temporary injunction has been
elaborately discussed. Existence of a prima facie case in favour of
the plaintiff-appellant needs no discussion as learned trial court has
held that the plaintiff has a prima facie case in its favour while
discussing the ingredients of irreparable injury, the Hon’ble Supreme
Court held in the case of Dalpat Kumar (supra) that the Court has to
satisfy  that   non-interference    by   the  Court   would    result  in
"irreparable injury" to the party seeking relief and that there is no
other remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction
and he needs protection from the consequences of apprehended
injury or dispossession. Irreparable injury, however, does not mean
that there must be no physical possibility of repairing the injury, but
means only that the injury must be a material one, namely one that
cannot be adequately compensated by way of damages.
15.           On a scrutiny of the case of the appellant in the light of
the aforesaid principles settled, it is seen that the plaintiff/appellant
has an alternative road from pillar No.29 of Roida-I mines leading to
NH-215 available for movement of his carriers and other purposes.

                                   22
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that at present the
appellant is using the road from pillar No.29 to have access to NH-
215 from Roida-I mines on temporary permission of the Forest
Department. When an alternative road is available for the appellant
for transport of iron ore materials and movement of carriers from
Roida-I mines to NH-215, it cannot be said that the appellant would
suffer irreparable injury if the order of injunction is refused.
             Next comes the question of ‘balance of convenience’. In
the case of Dalpat Kumar (supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held
that the Court, while granting or refusing to grant injunction, should
exercise sound judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial
mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties, if the
injunction is refused and compare it with that it is likely to be
caused to the other side if the injunction is granted. If on weighing
competing possibilities or probabilities of likelihood of injury the
Court considers that pending the suit, the subject-matter should be
maintained in status quo, an injunction would be issued.
16.          It is the admitted case of the parties that the suit road
falls within the leasehold area of Roida-II mines leased out in favour
of the respondent. The respondent claims that the suit road is no
more in existence at present as it falls within the operational area of
the mining lease of the respondent as per the mining plan approved
by the IBM and deviation from such mining plan would entail
prosecution under Section 13(2) of the Rules, 1988 as well as

                                   23
cancellation of the lease. On the other hand, exigency to use the suit
road by the appellant does not arise at this stage because he has an
alternate road for movement of his carriers and transportation etc. In
view of the above, comparative mischief or prejudice is more likely to
be caused to the respondent if an order of injunction is granted.
Thus, balance of convenience leans in favour of the respondent and
not in favour of the appellant.
17.          Injunction is a relief of equity and discretion. Thus, he
who seeks an order of injunction must come to the Court with clean
hand. Though in one hand the plaintiff/appellant has taken a
specific stand before this Court in W.P.(C) No.23722 of 2011 to the
effect that Roida-I iron ore mines has approach to NH-215 from
pillar No.29 and it is the only road available to him for movement of
his carriers. On the other hand, he comes up with a different case in
the suit that the suit road is the only way of approach to NH-215.
The pleading in the suit is conspicuously silent about the existence
of alternate road from pillar No.29 of Roida-I mines to NH-215. After
disposal    of   the    interim    application  for  injunction,   the
plaintiff/appellant made an attempt to amend its pleading by
incorporating the pleadings to the effect that the statement on oath
in the writ proceeding        before this Court to the effect that the
plaintiff has only approach to NH-215 from pillar No.29 was on a
different context and the said petition was rejected. It is also
admitted during course of argument by learned counsel for the

                                    24
appellant that till date the appellant is transporting the materials
from pillar No.29 to the NH-215 by obtaining temporary permission
from the Forest Department.          Clause-196 of General Rules and
Circular Orders, (Civil) Vol.-I (for short ‘GRCO’) provides as follows:
      “196. Particulars in the application for injunction
      to be supported by affidavit- Every application for an
      injunction must be supported by affidavit. All material
      facts must be fully and fairly stated to the Court and
      there must be no concealment or misrepresentation of
      any material fact.”
Thus, all material facts must be fully and fairly stated to the Court
by the applicant who seeks a temporary injunction. There must be
no concealment or misrepresentation of any material fact.          In the
case of M/s. Seemax Construction (P) Ltd. –v- State Bank of India
and another, reported in AIR 1992 Delhi 197, it has been held as
under:
      “10. The suppression of material fact by itself is a
      sufficient ground to decline the discretionary relief of
      injunction. A party seeking discretionary relief has to
      approach the court with clean hands and is required to
      disclose all material facts which may, one way or the
      other, affect the decision. A person deliberately
      concealing material facts from court is not entitled to
      any discretionary relief. The court can refuse to hear
      such person on merits. A person seeking relief of
      injunction is required to make honest disclosure of all
      relevant statements of facts otherwise it would amount
      to an abuse of the process of the court. Reference may
      be made to decision in The King v. The General
      Commissioners for the purposes of the Income-tax Acts
      for the District of Kensingion, 1917 (1) King's Bench
      Division 486 where the court refused a writ of
      prohibition without going into the merits because of
      suppression of material facts by the applicant. The
      legal position in our country is also no different. (See

                                    25
         : Charanji Lal v. Financial Commissioner, Haryana,
         Chandigarh, AIR 1978 Punjab and Haryana 326
         (1711)). Reference may also be made to a decision of
         the Supreme Court in Udai Chand v. Shankar Lal, . In
         the said decision the Supreme Court revoked the order
         granting special leave and held that there was a
         misstatement of material fact and that amounted to
         serious misrepresentation. The principles applicable
         are same whether it is a case of misstatement of a
         material fact or suppression of material fact.”
 Thus, there remains no element of doubt that the plaintiff/appellant
 has not come to the Court with clean hand to seek for a relief of
 equity and discretion inasmuch as he has suppressed material fact,
 which was brought to light by the defendant-respondent.
 18.           In that view of the matter, the appellant fails in all
 respect to establish a case for grant of temporary injunction in its
 favour. Thus, I find no reason to interfere with the impugned order.
 Hence, the appeal fails and the same is accordingly dismissed, but in
 the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
