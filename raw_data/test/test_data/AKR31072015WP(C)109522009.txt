     PRESENT:
                     THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
     Date of Hearing :27.7.2015            :            Date of Judgment: 31.7.2015
Dr.A.K.Rath, J. In this writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution of
     India, the petitioner challenges the order dated 25.6.2009 passed by the
     appellate authority, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. Mumbai-opposite party no.4,
     vide Annexure-13. By the said order, the opposite party no.4 confirmed the
     order dated 15.1.2009 passed by the Divisional Retail Sales Manager,
     Sambalpur D.O., Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.,-opposite party no.1, vide
     Annexure-10, terminating the dealership of the petitioner.

                                           2
2.            The case of the petitioner is that pursuant to the dealership
agreement dated 20.2.2007, vide Annexure-1, he was running a petrol and
diesel outlet at Borigumma in the district of Koraput in the name and style
of “Keshari Service Station”. The retail outlet is situated at a distance of 17
K.Ms. from Jeypore. He had taken every effort to meet the standards
prescribed by the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as “the
IOCL”). Though several inspections and checks were made by the IOCL,
Police and Civil Supplies Department, but no irregularities were pointed out
or detected. On 12.6.2008, the Divisional Manager (RS), Sambalpur Division
visited the retail outlet in absence of the petitioner, inspected the petrol
pump, found the irregularities, immediately stopped the sale of products and
suspended the supply of the products to the retail outlet. On the very same
day, a letter was issued to the petitioner directing to explain the reasons
about the discrepancies detected during the visit of opposite party no.1,
which is quoted hereunder:-
              “During out visit to your RO on 12.06.2008 along with AM
       (RS)/Bgh; SRSM, OSO & Sr.Depot Mgr, Berhampur; the following
       discrepancies were observed:
              (1) Stock variation of MS in MS Tank-1 was beyond permissible
                  limit;
              (2) The entries made in DSR do not match with the invoices of the
                  products you have received.
              This is a violation of MDG-2005
              You are advised to
              (i)    Stock sale of all products with immediate effect.

                                            3
              (ii)   Explain the reasons for the above violation within seven
                     days of receipt of this letter.
       Kindly note that supply of products to your RO is being suspended
       temporarily till you reply. Sample of all products are being collected from
       your RO for testing at lab.
       The Dip and Meter reading of DU as noted now is as below:
       MS:Dip=48.0 cm. DU-1=750308.0 DU-2=105733 ( L& T Duo unit)
       XM=T-1=Dip-75.8 DU-1=2726549 ( Midco 981)
       XM-T-2=Dip=3.8 cm; DUI=18142 DU2=12010 (STP DUO Unit)
       This is without any prejudice to the rights of the Corporation.”
3.            On 16.6.2008, the petitioner submitted his reply stating therein
that the retail outlet is situated near Jayantgiri, Borigumma, which is at a
distance of 17 Kms. from Jeypore. For the last eight years, every effort was
made to meet the standards prescribed by the IOCL. During all these years,
the outlet was inspected by the Officers of the IOCL, Police personnel and
Civil Supply Authorities. At no point of time any irregularities or any kind of
discrepancies were ever pointed out or detected. It is further stated that on
the date of inspection, he has received 4 KL MS, which had not been taken
into account while the stock was verified. Though the stock was unloaded in
the outlet, the staffs of the tanker carrying the challan had gone to the
nearby hotel for taking lunch. The staffs of the retail outlet could not show
the challan regarding receipts of 4 KL MS. This lapse is on the part of the
employee. If receipts of 4 KL MS is taken into account, there would be no
discrepancy. The staff, who was present at the time of inspection, was a

                                       4
newly appointee and was not well versed with the maintenance of entries in
the Daily Stock Register (‘DSR’ in short). The mistake occurred was
unintentional and by inadvertence and the same will not occur in future. In
continuance of the earlier reply, again on 12.7.2008 the petitioner submitted
his reply stating that on the date of inspection, he has received 4 KL MS &
7.5. KL Xtra Mile. As per the procedure, the staff verified the deep and
density of MS, kept the same in the container and unloaded the 4 KL MS
product. At that time the inspection team arrived at the retail outlet and the
staffs were busy with them to produce the papers. They could not check the
TT and unload the Xtra Mile 7.5. KL. i.e., other two chambers. Since it was a
lunch time, the driver had gone to a nearby hotel for taking lunch for which
Xtra Mile could not be unloaded. Though MS was unloaded and TT retention
sample was taken, but the staff forgot to produce the same since they were
busy with the inspection team. The sample was yet to be labeled and signed
by the TT driver. Further, the TT sample was in safe custody. Again on
18.8.2008, the petitioner sent another representation to the opposite party
no.1, vide Annexure-5 reiterating the earlier stand. While the matter stood
thus, on 1.9.2008, the opposite party no.1 issued show cause notice to the
petitioner stating therein that a surprise inspection was carried out by a
team of the IOCL at the retail outlet on 12.06.2008. During the inspection,
the DSR was not maintained properly. There was a positive variation of 4047
liters in MS stock and the same was beyond permissible variation limits. As

                                       5
per the prescribed guidelines under MDG-2005, product samples were
drawn from the retail outlet for testing at laboratory. The samples were
tested at Paradeep Laboratory. Both HSD and MS samples were found to
meet specification with respect to tests done, vide Lab Report No.LPD/683 &
LPD/684 dated 24.6.208. The petitioner was asked to show cause as to why
penal action shall not be taken against him in accordance with MDG-2005
and dealership agreement dated 20.2.2007, for stock variation beyond
permissible limits as per clauses no.9 read with clause no.6 of MDG-2005
for Unauthorized purchase/sales/exchange of MS/HSD and violation of
terms and conditions of the dealership agreement dated 20.2.2007, vide
Annexure-6 series.
4.           Challenging, inter alia, the show cause notice, the petitioner
filed a writ application before this Court, which was registered as W.P.(C)
No.13312 of 2008. The said writ application was disposed of on 20.11.2008
by a Division Bench of this Court granting liberty to the petitioner to file
show cause within a period of two weeks. It was observed that in case the
petitioner submits his show cause and application for allowing to sell the
fuel which is not adulterated and competent authority on perusal of the said
show cause comes to conclusion that the fuel, which is stored at the outlet,
is not adulterated, an appropriate decision may be taken by the officers of
the Oil Company for selling of the same in presence of any of the officers of
the company and the representative of the petitioner. Thereafter, the

                                        6
petitioner submitted his show cause on 29.12.2008, vide Annexure-9, but
the opposite party no.1 did not grant him permission to sell the stock. On
15.1.2009, he received a notice wherein his dealership was terminated, vide
Annexure-10. The petitioner unsuccessfully challenged the same before the
appellate authority. By order dated 25.6.2009, the appellate authority-
opposite party no.4 dismissed the appeal, vide Annexure-13. With this
factual scenario, the instant petition has been filed.
5.           Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has been filed
by the opposite parties 1 to 4. It is stated that the writ application is not
maintainable as the parties are bound by the contract, which is a realm of
private law. It is not a statutory contract. The contractual obligations cannot
be enforced by the writ court. Dealership Agreement of the petitioner is a
commercial contract. Thus, once terminated cannot be restored as per
Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. It is further stated since the
disputed questions of fact are involved, the writ application is not
maintainable. An alternative remedy by way of arbitration for settlement of
dispute is provided under Clause-61 of the dealership agreement dated
20.2.2007 is available and as such the writ application is not maintainable.
The further case of the opposite parties is that the last inspection of the
retail outlet of the petitioner was done on 30.3.2008. The DSR was not
maintained properly with regard to MS receipts. It was observed that on
12.6.2008 a surprise inspection was carried out on the retail outlet . During

                                       7
inspection, it was found that the stock variation in MS Tank-1 was beyond
permissible limit i.e., excess of 4074 liters of MS was found and the entries
made in the DSR do not match with the invoices of the products received by
the petitioner. Therefore, the petitioner was advised to stop sale of all
products with immediate effect. It is further stated that the petitioner sent a
letter on 16.6.2008. The explanation was not found satisfactory. The reply
dated 12.7.2008 of the petitioner contradicts the earlier reply dated
16.6.2008. In the letter dated 16.6.2008, there was no mention with regard
to receipt of 7.5 KL Xtra Mile whereas in the letter dated 12.7.2008, it was
stated that he had received 4 KL MS and 7.5 KL Xtra Mile. As per the
procedure the staff verified the deep and density of MS, kept the same in the
container and unloaded the 4 KL MS product. Since the staffs were busy
with the inspection team, they could not produce the papers. The petitioner
in his letter dated 18.8.2008 acknowledged that he had made correction in
Daily Stock Register and forwarded the same containing the correct entries.
It is further stated that a show cause notice was issued to the petitioner on
1.9.2008 requiring him to file show cause for taking penal action as per the
dealership agreement dated 20.2.2007 for violation of various clauses of the
dealership agreement and the provisions of Marking Discipline Guideline,
2005 (hereinafter referred to as “MDG”). The same was received by the
petitioner and he sought time to file reply. At this juncture, he filed W.P.(C)
No.13312 of 2008 before this Court challenging the show cause notice. By

                                        8
order dated 20.11.2008, the writ application was disposed of granting liberty
to the petitioner to file reply within two weeks. It is further stated that the
petitioner in his explanation has not mentioned that he has received 7.5 KL
Xtra Mile through the same invoice dated 12.6.2008. The inspecting officials
though reached at the petitioner’s retail outlet at 14.30 hours on 12.6.2008
have not seen the received of product by any tank truck during the time of
inspection. The distance of the retail outlet of the petitioner from the depot is
17 KM. The tank truck loaded for the petitioner’s retail outlet left the supply
location at 15.30 hours as per depot gate/security register and invoice time
put at 15.23 hours. The inspecting official reached the retail outlet at 14.30
hours and the inspection was completed at 17.15 hours. Till completion of
the inspection no tank truck reported at retail outlet for decantation. It is
further stated that the stock variation found out by the inspecting officials
had occurred by the petitioner deliberately and illegally. Since the
explanation submitted by the petitioner was found unsatisfactory, the
competent authority of the IOCL terminated the dealership agreement in
exercise of power conferred under Clause 45(k) & (o) of the dealership
agreement and Clause-9 of the MDG-2005. The appellate authority after
affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and considering the
documents filed by him by a reasoned order dismissed the appeal. The
further case of the opposite parties is that the IOCL on 20.1.2009 appointed
one of the existing dealer i.e., M/s.Tanveer Filling Station to operate the

                                       9
retail outlet on temporary/ad hoc basis. The IOCL had taken over the
possession of the retail outlet on 27.1.2009. On the very same day the retail
outlet was handed over to the ad hoc dealer M/s.Tanveer Filling Station. The
aforesaid arrangement is still continuing.
6.            Heard Mr.S.P.Sarangi, learned counsel for the petitioner and
Mr.S.Nanda, learned counsel for the opposite parties 1 to 4.
7.            Mr.Sarangi, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
writ application is maintainable to enforce contractual obligation of the
IOCL, an instrumentality of the State. Further alternative remedy is not a
bar to entertain a writ application. He submitted that the retail outlet of the
petitioner is situated at 17 Kms. from Jeypore. The petitioner has made
every effort to meet the standards prescribed by the IOCL. On several
occasions, the outlet was inspected by the official of IOCL, police department
as well as Civil Supplies Department. Not a single irregularity was pointed
out. On 12.6.2008 the opposite party no.1 visited the retail outlet in absence
of the petitioner and inspected the petrol pump. He found certain
irregularities, immediately stopped the sale of the product and suspended
the supply of the product to the retail outlet. With regard to the allegations
that there was variation of stock of MS in MS Tank-1 beyond permissible
limit, he submitted that on 12.6.2008 the petitioner had received 4 KL MS
and 7.5 KL. Xtra Mile. As per procedure, the staff verified the deep and

                                       10
density of MS, kept the same in the container and unloaded the 4 KL MS
product. At that time, the inspection team arrived at the retail outlet. Since
the staffs were busy with them, they could not check the T.T. and unload the
7.5 KL Xtra Mile in other two chambers. Even though MS was unloaded and
TT retention sample was taken, since the staffs were busy with the
inspection team, they forgot to produce the same. He further submitted that
the staff of retail outlet was newly appointee for which DSR could not be
maintained. Relying on Clause 9 of MDG 2005, he further submitted that
when the samples were found to meet the specification and some
irregularities were detected, only fine can be imposed. Drawing my attention
to the Annexure-6 series, he submitted that the samples were tested at
Paradip Laboratory. Both HSD and MS samples were found to meet
specification with respect to tests done. Clause 6.1.13 of MDG-2005 provides
imposition of penalty if the dealer is in habit of not maintaining any of the
records mentioned in Sub Clause (a) to (d) and penal action to be taken as
per Appendix-1. The same provides imposition of penalty. In the instant
case, the dealership agreement has been terminated, which is not in
consonance with MGD-2005.
8.            To buttress his submission, Mr.Sarangi, learned counsel for the
petitioner has cited decisions in the case of ABL International Ltd. and
another Vrs. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and others,
(2004) 3 SCC 553, Karnataka State Forest Industries Corporation Vrs. Indian

                                       11
Rocks, (2009) 1 SCC 150 and Union of India and others Vrs. Tantia
Construction Private Limited, (2011) 5 SCC 697.
9.           Per contra, Mr.Nanda, learned counsel for the opposite parties 1
to 4 submitted that the writ application involves disputed questions of fact
and as such the same is not maintainable. Drawing my attention to Clause
61 of the Dealership Agreement, vide Annexure-1, he submitted that since
the alternative remedy by way of arbitration for settlement of dispute is
provided for disputed question of facts cannot be adjudicated in a writ
application. He further submitted that the dealership agreement is not a
statutory contract and contractual obligation cannot be enforced by a writ
court. He further submitted that on earlier occasions, the retail outlet was
inspected by the officials of the IOCL. It was found that DSR was not
properly maintained. When a surprised inspection was made on 12.6.2008,
several irregularities were detected as would be evident from the show cause,
vide Annexure-2. Since the explanation submitted by the petitioner was
found unsatisfactory, opposite party no.4 terminated the dealership
agreement. The appellate authority after affording an opportunity of hearing
to the petitioner and considering all the documents, confirmed the order
passed by the opposite party no.1. He further submitted that the petitioner
gave an undertaking that he will not commit any mistake in future, which
pre-supposes that the petitioner has admitted his fault. Since the petitioner

                                        12
has violated the provisions of MDG-2005 and dealership agreement, rightly
his dealership agreement was terminated.

cited decisions in the case of Bareilly Development Authority and another Vrs.

11.          Having regard to the pleadings of the parties and contentions
advanced at the Bar, the following points, inter alia, arise for consideration
of this Court :-
       1.    Whether a writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution
             of India is maintainable to enforce the contractual obligation of
             the State or its instrumentality, by an aggrieved party?
       2.    Whether alternative remedy is a bar to entertain the writ
             application?
       3.    Whether the opposite party no.4 is justified in terminating the
             dealership agreement?
Point No.1
12.          In Ajay Pal Singh (supra), it was held that where the contract
entered into between the State and the persons aggrieved is non-statutory
and purely contractual and the rights are governed only by the terms of the
contract, no writ or order can be issued under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India so as to complete the authorities to remedy a breach of contract
pure and simple. The same view was taken in Pimpari Chinchwad Municipal
Corporation and others (supra).
13.          In ABL International Ltd. and another (supra), a question arose
whether a writ application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is
maintainable     to enforce    contractual  obligation  of  the  State or   its
instrumentality, by an aggrieved party. After survey of the earlier decision,

                                         14
the apex Court taking a cue from the Gunwant Kaur Vrs. Municipal
Committee, Bhatinda, (1969) 3 SCC 769 came to hold that it is not an
absolute rule that in all cases involving disputed questions of fact the parties
should be relegated to the suit. It was further held that merely because one
of the parties to the litigation raises a dispute in regard to the facts of the
case, the court entertaining such petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution is not always bound to relegate the parties to a suit. In the
case of Gunwant Kaur, the apex Court even went to the extent of holding
that in a writ application, if the facts require, even oral evidence can be
taken. This clearly shows that in an appropriate case, the writ court has the
jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving disputed questions of fact
and there is no absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition even if the same
arises out of a contractual obligation and/or involves some disputed
questions of fact. Paragraph 27 of the report is quoted hereunder:-
              “27. From the above discussion of ours, the following legal
             principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:
             (a)    In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a
                    State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of a
                    contractual obligation is maintainable.
             (b)    Merely because some disputed questions of fact arise
                    for consideration, same cannot be a ground to refuse
                    to entertain a writ petition in all cases as a matter of
                    rule.
             (c)     A writ petition involving a consequential relief of
                    monetary claim is also maintainable.”

                                         15
14.         In Karnatak State Forest Industries Corporation (supra), the apex
Court in paragraphs 38 and 39 of the report held as follows:-
                   “38. Although ordinarily a superior court in exercise of
            its writ jurisdiction would not enforce the terms of a contract
            qua contract, it is trite that when an action of the State is
            arbitrary or discriminatory and, thus, violative of Article 14 of
            the Constitution of India, a writ petition would be
            maintainable.
                   39. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that a writ
            of mandamus can be issued only when there exists a legal
            right in the writ petition and a corresponding legal duty on
            the part of the State, but then if any action on the part of the
            State is wholly unfair or arbitrary, the superior courts are not
            powerless”.
15.         Thus, the writ application arising out of contractual obligation is
maintainable as held by the apex Court in ABL International Ltd. (supra).
Point No.2
16.         Clause 61 (a) of the agreement, vide Annexure-1, is as follows:-
            “61 (a) Any dispute or difference of any nature whatsoever,
                   any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim or set-off or
                   regarding any right, liability, act, omission or account
                   of any of the parties hereto arising out of or in relation
                   to this agreement shall be referred to the sole
                   arbitration of the Director (Marketing) of the
                   Corporation who may either himself act as the
                   Arbitrator or nominate some other officer of the
                   Corporation to act as the Arbitrator. The Dealer will
                   not be entitled to raise any objection to any such
                   Arbitrator on the ground that the Arbitrator is an
                   officer of the Corporation.”
17.         In Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and others (supra), it
was held that merely because a contract is entered into in exercise of an
enabling power conferred by a statute that by itself cannot render the

                                       16
contract a statutory contract. If entering into a contract containing the
prescribed terms and conditions is a must under the statue then that
contract becomes a statutory contract. If a contract incorporates certain
terms and conditions in it which are statutory then the said contract to that
extent is statutory. A contract may contain certain other terms and
conditions which may not be of a statutory character and which have been
incorporation therein as a result of mutual agreement between the parties. It
was further held that a statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a
statutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to discharge its
functions. Dispute arising out of the terms of such contracts or alleged
breaches have to be settled by the ordinary principles of law of contract. The
fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a statutory or public body will
not by itself affect the principles to be applied. The disputes about the
meaning of a covenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be
determined according to the usual principles of the Contract Act. Every act of
a statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of statutory power.
Statutory bodies, like private parties, have power to contract or deal with
property. Such activities may not raise any issue of public law. The contract
between the parties is in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory
contract. The disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions
of such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under Article
226 of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a civil

                                        17
court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract. Whether any amount is
due and if so, how much and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or
not, are not the matters which could have been agitated and decided in a writ
petition. The contractor should have relegated to other remedies.
18.          In Tantia Construction Private Limited (supra), a contention was
raised on behalf of the appellant-Union of India that since the agreement
between the parties provided for arbitration in respect of all disputes and
differences of any kind arising out of or in connection with the contract, the
writ court was not competent to decide the issue involved in the dispute. The
apex Court in paragraph-33 of the report came to hold that even on the
question of maintainability of the writ petition on account of the arbitration
clause included in the agreement between the parties, it is now well
established that an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to the
invocation of the writ jurisdiction of the High Court or the Supreme Court
and that without exhausting such alternative remedy, a writ petition would
not be maintainable. The constitutional powers vested in the High Court or
the Supreme Court cannot be fettered by any alternative remedy available to
the authorities. Injustice, whenever and wherever it takes place, has to be
struck down as an anathema to the rule of law and the provisions of the
Constitution.

                                          18
19.          After survey of the earlier decisions, the Supreme Court in the
case of Whirlpool Corporation (supra), in paragraphs 15 and 20 of the report
held as follows:
             “15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court,
             having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to
             entertain or not to entertain a Writ Petition. But the High
             Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of
             which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is
             available, the High Court would not normally exercise its
             jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been consistently
             held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three
             contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed
             for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or
             where there has been a violation of the principle of natural
             justice or where the order of proceedings are wholly without
             jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged. There is a
             plethora of case-law on this point put to cut down this circle
             of forensic Whirlpool, we would rely on some old decisions of
             the evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they still hold
             the field.
                     xxx                 xxx                 xxx
             20. Much water has since flown beneath the bridge, but there
             has been no corrosive effect on these decisions which, though
             old, continue to hold the field with the result that law as to
             the jurisdiction of the High Court in entertaining a writ
             petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, in spite of the
             alternative statutory remedies, is not affected, specially in a
             case where the authority against whom the writ is filed is
             shown to have had no jurisdiction or had purported to usurp
             jurisdiction without any legal foundation.”
20.          Thus alternative remedy is not a bar to entertain a writ
application under Article 226 of the Constitution in at least three
contingencies mentioned in Whirlpool Corporation (supra), namely, where the
writ application has been filed for the enforcement of any of the fundamental
rights or where there has been violation of principles of natural justice or

                                       19
where the order of the proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction of the
vires of the Act is challenge.
21.           A bare reading of the decisions cited by the learned counsel for
the opposite parties in the case of Sundar Lal Jain, Ajay Pal Singh, Jahan
Khan, Satwati Deswal, Puravankara Projects Ltd. Lalit Popli, B.C.Chaturvedi,
R.S.Saini, S.Vasanthi, Anup Kumar Kundu and Nareshkumar Badrikumar
Jagad (supra) however, show that there is significant difference in the factual
matrix in which the said cases arise for consideration. Reliance placed upon
the said decisions is of no assistance to the opposite parties.
22.           There is no whisper in the writ application that the impugned
order is an infraction of principles of natural justice or the order of
termination passed by the authority has no jurisdiction to pass the same.
Point No.3
23.           During inspection on 12.6.2008, the IOCL officials detected the
irregularities mentioned in the inspection report, vide Annexure-2 (quoted in
paragraph 2 above). The petitioner submitted his reply taking a stand that
he has received 4 KL MS, which has not been taken into account while stock
was verified. Though the stock was unloaded in the outlet, driver of the
tanker carrying challan had gone to nearby a hotel for taking lunch. Staff of
retail outlet could not show the challan regarding receipt of 4 KL MS. The
petitioner admitted that it was lapse on the part of the employee and

                                         20
submitted reply on 16.6.2008. So far as discrepancy with regard to
maintenance of DSR is concerned, it is stated that the staff present on the
date of inspection was a newly appointee and not well versed with the
maintenance of entries in the DSR. Thus discrepancy occurred. A copy of the
extract with correct entries of the DSR was sent on 16.6.2008, vide
Annexure-3. The petitioner had undertaken to abide the rules and
regulations of the IOCL. Again another reply was submitted on 12.7.2008
explaining therein that on 12.6.2008 the petitioner received 4 KL MS and 7.5
KL Xtra Mile. As per the procedure, the staffs verified the deep and density of
the MS, kept the same in the container and unloaded the 4 KL MS product.
At the same time inspection team arrived on the retail outlet. Since the staffs
were busy with them, they could not check the T.T. and unload the 7.5 KL
Xtra Mile. It was a lunched time. The driver of the tanker had gone to nearby
a hotel for taking lunch for which Xtra Mile could not be unloaded. Even
though MS was unloaded and TT retention sample was taken, yet since the
staff was busy with the inspection team, they forgot to produce the same.
The same plea was taken in the representation dated 18.8.2008, vide
Annexure-5.
24.          Much reliance has been placed upon the reports, vide Annexure-
6 series. The same reveal that both the HSD and MS samples were found to
meet the specification with respect to tests done, but the fact remains that at
the time of inspection of retail outlet, it was found that there was variation of

                                           21
stock of MS and the entries made in the DSR do not match with the invoice
of the products. During inspection of RO, stock variation of 4074 litres was
detected, which was much beyond the permissible limits of 106 litres. The
petitioner also sought to explain the variation, which was not found to be
satisfactory by the IOCL. There are disputed questions of fact which cannot
be effectively adjudicated in a writ application.
25.             In view of the same, it is open to the petitioner to invoke Clause
61 of the Dealership Agreement for referring the matter to the Arbitration.
The writ application is dismissed. No Costs.
                                                              ………………………..
                                                               Dr.A.K.Rath, J.
