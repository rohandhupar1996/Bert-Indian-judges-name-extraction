S. K. SAHOO, J.     The appellant Madrasi Champia @ Nayak faced trial
        in the Court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Talcher in S.T.
        Case No. 126/02/95/02 for offence punishable under section 302
        of Indian Penal Code for committing murder of Lochan Batudi
        (hereafter ‘the deceased’) on 24.03.2002 at Lingaraj Township in
        a newly constructed quarters.

                                2
             The learned trial Court found the appellant guilty
under section 302 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to
undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in
default, to undergo R.I. for six months more.
2.           The prosecution case as per the First information
report (Ext.8) presented by Santosh Kumar Agarwala (P.W.6) on
25.03.2002 before the officer in-charge, Colliery Police Station,
Talcher is that the informant who was a contractor had taken the
construction work of ‘B’ and ‘C’ type quarters of M/s. Mahanandi
Coalfields Ltd., Lingaraj area at Lingaraj Township. The appellant
and the deceased who were the labourers were staying in one
uncompleted quarters bearing quarters no. 121 of Block No.21 of
‘B’ type. It is the further prosecution case that on 25.03.2002
finding both the labourers absent from the work site, the
supervisor of the informant namely Ramesh Chandra Pradhan
(P.W.2) in order to ascertain the reason for their absence went
to the quarters in which they were staying and found the same
to be locked from the outside but noticed that the window of the
quarters was opened. Peeping through the window, P.W.2 found
the deceased lying dead in a pool of blood sustaining injuries on
his body. P.W.2 immediately informed the informant who also
came to the work site and found the deceased lying dead and
blood was oozing out from his body. Suspecting that the

                                 3
appellant might have committed murder of the deceased and
fled away after locking the door, the First Information Report
was lodged.
             On the basis of the First Information Report, Sri
Prahalad Chandra Mallik (P.W.12), Sub-Inspector of Police,
Colliery Police Station registered Colliery P.S. Case No. 48 dated
25.03.2002 under section 302 of Indian Penal Code in the
absence    of   the   officer-in-charge   and    himself took   up
investigation.
3.           During course of investigation, P.W.12 examined the
informant and other witnesses, visited the spot and prepared
spot map Ext.13. On 26.03.2002 the scientific team and police
dog squad visited the spot and detected some physical clue
materials. The I.O. held inquest over the dead body of the
deceased on 26.03.2002 in presence of the Executive Magistrate
and sent the dead body for post mortem examination. He seized
one lock, one pair of Chappals under seizure list Ext.2. He also
seized sample gauge cloth, saline extract of blood stains, portion
of blood stained mosquito net, portion of blood stained plastic
rope, sample extract of blood stained gauge under seizure list
Ext.4. He also seized one blood stained blue check lungi, one
deep colour half banyan stained with blood, one underwear
stained with blood, one stripe lungi, one plastic mat, one brass

                               4
made ring, one wooden pidha and command certificate under
seizure list Ext.7. He arrested the appellant on 01.04.2002 and
seized one white cotton lungi stained with blood, one full cotton
white shirt stained with blood, one napkin stained with blood on
being produced by the accused under seizure list Ext.5. While
the accused was in police custody, he gave information about the
concealment of the weapon of offence i.e. crow bar in a bushy
forest and basing on such information and on being lead by the
appellant, the I.O. seized one crow bar on the production by the
accused under section 27 of the Evidence Act under seizure list
Ext.1. The appellant was forwarded to Court on 02.04.2002. On
07.04.2002 the Circle Inspector of Police, Talcher took over
charge of investigation from P.W.12. The wearing apparels of the
appellant and the deceased, weapon of offence, sample blood
and other materials which were collected were sent SFSL,
Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar through Court for chemical analysis.
After completion of investigation, the Circle Inspector of Police
submitted charge sheet on 26.07.2002 against the appellant
under section 302 of Indian Penal Code.
4.           After submission of charge sheet, the case was
committed to the Court of Session for trial after observing due
committal procedure where the learned Trial Court charged the
appellant under section 302 of Indian Penal Code on 21.12.2002

                                5
and since the appellant refuted the charge, pleaded not guilty
and claimed to be tried, the sessions trial procedure was
resorted to prosecute him and establish his guilt.
5.          During course of trial, in order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined twelve witnesses.
            P.W.1 Naresh Nayak is a witness to the seizure of
crow bar at the instance of the appellant under seizure list Ext.1.
            P.W.2 Ramesh Chandra Pradhan was the supervisor
of P.D. Construction Company who stated to have marked the
deceased lying dead on the floor of the quarters with bleeding
injuries. He is also a witness to the seizure of a pair of chappals
under seizure list Ext.2 and a witness to the inquest over the
dead body of the deceased vide inquest report Ext.3.
            P.W.3 Kartika Naik was the watchman under P.D.
Construction Company and he has stated that the appellant and
the deceased were staying together in quarter no.121 of Block
B/21 in separate rooms and he had seen both of them together
in that semi-constructed quarter at about 11 O’ Clock in the
night. He further stated to have seen the deceased lying dead in
a pool of blood and Scientific Officer collecting materials which
were seized by police under seizure list Ext.4. He further stated
about seizure of wearing apparels of the appellant under seizure
list Ext.5.

                                6
             P.W.4 Binayak Jena stated about the seizure of one
crow bar at the instance of the appellant which was seized under
seizure list Ext.1.
             P.W.5   Madhaba    Chandra   Sahu   was   the  Police
Constable attached to Colliery Police Station who stated about
the seizure of command certificate, wearing apparels of the
deceased, wooden plank and one plastic mat under seizure list
Ext.7.
             P.W.6 Santosh Kumar Agarwala was the contractor
who had taken the construction work of the quarters in which the
appellant and the deceased were working as labourers. He is the
informant in the case who stated to have seen the deceased
lying dead in a pool of blood in the room where he was staying.
             P.W.7 Jamsed Alli is a witness to the seizure of one
napkin, one lungi and one shirt of the accused under seizure list
Ext.5 so also the seizure of wearing apparels of the deceased
under seizure list Ext.7.
             P.W.8 Durga Prasad Mohapatra was the Scientific
officer who visited the spot on 26.03.2002 and collected certain
incriminating articles from the spot which were seized by Police
and subsequently sent for chemical examination.

                               7
            P.W.9 Nirmala Chandra Pati was the Executive
Magistrate, Talcher who was present at the time of inquest and
signed the inquest report Ext.3
            P.W.10    Dr.   Santilata  Mohanty    conducted   post
mortem examination over the dead body of the deceased on
26.03.2002. She opined the cause of death due to shock and
hemorrhage resulting from the stab wound noticed on the
deceased.
            P.W.11 Suresh Nath was the constable who carried
the dead body for post mortem examination and produced the
wearing apparels of the deceased before the Investigating Officer
after post mortem examination.
            P.W.12 Prahalad Chandra Mallik is the Investigating
Officer.
            The    prosecution   exhibited  fourteen   documents.
Exts.1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 are the seizure lists, Ext.3 is the inquest
report, Ext.6 is the statement of the appellant, Ext.8 is the First
Information Report, Ext.9 is the report of Scientific Officer
(P.W.8), Ext.10 is the post mortem report, Ext.11 is the
command certificate, Ext.12 is the dead body challan, Ext.13 is
the spot map and Ext.14 is the chemical examination report.
            The prosecution also proved six material objects.
M.O.I is the crow bar, M.O.II is the contents of exhibit marked as

                                8
‘B’, M.O.III is the packet containing clothes, M.O.IV is the packet
containing portion of mosquito net, M.O.V is the packet
containing portion of blood stained plastic rope and M.O.VI is the
wooden pidha.
6.           The defence plea of the appellant was one of denial
and it was specifically pleaded that he had neither made any
disclosure statement before police regarding concealment of
weapon of offence nor gave recovery of any such weapon and
that the police has foisted the case against him.
7.           The learned trial Court has been pleased to held that
the deceased and the appellant were staying in one quarters and
on 25.03.2002 night the appellant assaulted the deceased by a
crow bar causing injuries which are sufficient in the ordinary
course of nature to cause death. The appellant used a crow bar
which is a deadly weapon and assaulted on the vital part of the
body i.e. neck of the deceased and after killing the deceased, he
left the place of occurrence and that the appellant intentionally
caused injury having the intention to kill the deceased and
accordingly found the appellant guilty under section 302 of
Indian Penal Code.
8.           Adverting over the nature and cause of death of the
deceased, we find that apart from the inquest report Ext.3, the
prosecution has also relied upon the evidence of P.W.10 Dr.

                                 9
Santilata Mohanty who conducted post mortem examination over
the cadaver of the deceased on 26.03.2002 on police requisition
at S.D. Hospital, Talcher. During post mortem examination, she
noticed the following injuries:-
            One   stab   wound     present in the   left  side
            extending from the base posterior triangle of
            neck upto the base of mandible (left) of size 6” x
            3” x 3”.
            She found that the cervical fourth and fifth vertebra
was separated and the spinal cord was also severed. On
dissection, she found common carotid internal jugular vein and
internal carotid on the left side neck was cut. She opined the
cause of death due to shock and hemorrhage and the injuries
found on the body of the deceased were sufficient in ordinary
course of nature to cause death. She proved the post mortem
report Ext.10. She stated that she found only one stab injury on
the body of the deceased which is possible by weapon like farsa
having 6” in the blade portion.
            The learned counsel for the appellant has not
challenged the evidence of P.W.10 or the findings in the post-
mortem report Ext.10. The learned trial Court has also discussed
about the nature of death of the deceased with reference to the
evidence of doctor P.W.10 and post-mortem report Ext.10 and

                                10
came to hold that the death of the deceased was homicidal in
nature.
             After perusing the evidence on record, the post-
mortem examination report Ext.10 and the statement of P.W.10
Dr. Santilata Mohanty, we are of the view that there is no
infirmity in the findings of the learned trial Court regarding the
nature of death of the deceased to be homicidal in nature and
accordingly we concur with such findings.
9.           The learned counsel for the appellant Mr. Soroj
Kumar Dash contended that when there is no direct evidence in
the case and the case is based on circumstantial evidence and
the circumstances brought on record by the prosecution are not
clinching and they do not from a complete chain, it was not
proper on the part of the learned trial court to hold the appellant
guilty under section 302 of Indian Penal Code. It is his further
contention that though it is the prosecution case that one crow
bar was seized at the instance of the appellant but the doctor
conducting the post mortem examination has stated that the
stab injury noticed on the person of the deceased is possible by
farsa having 6” length in the blade portion and therefore the
crow bar cannot be said to be a weapon of offence. He further
contended that the wearing apparels of the appellant and seized
crow bar were sent for chemical analysis but no blood was found

                               11
on the same which proves the innocence of the appellant. It is
further contended that even though the appellant and the
deceased were stated to be staying in one quarters but they
were occupying two separate rooms and therefore merely
because the deceased was found dead with bleeding injury in his
room and the appellant was found absconding from the quarters,
it cannot be said that he is the author of the crime and
accordingly benefit of doubt should be extended in his favour.
The learned counsel put forth an alternative argument that there
was no motive behind the commission of crime and materials are
there that both the appellant and the deceased used to quarrel
with each other under intoxication and therefore the possibility of
quarrel between them on the night of occurrence cannot be ruled
out and if during such quarrel, one blow was given even on the
vital part of the body, it cannot be said that the ingredients of
offence under section 302 of Indian Penal Code was made out
rather it may at best be a case under section 304 Part-I of
Indian Penal Code.
             Mrs. Saswata Patnaik, on the other hand contended
that when during the late night on the date of occurrence, both
the appellant and the deceased were last seen together inside
the quarters and there was none else in that quarters except
those two and on the next date morning, the deceased was

                               12
found lying dead with bleeding injury and the appellant was
found absconding from the spot house and the door was locked
from outside, it is the appellant who was to explain under what
circumstances the deceased died. Having failed to discharge his
burden of proof which was especially within his knowledge in
view of the provision under section 106 of Evidence Act, it can be
held that it is none else but the appellant who was last seen in
the company of the deceased is the author of the crime. The
learned counsel for the State further contended that apart from
the last seen theory, there are materials like absconding of the
appellant as well as leading to discovery of the weapon of
offence which completes the chain of circumstances. The learned
counsel for the State pointed out that during course of
investigation, the I.O. sent the weapon of offence to the doctor
(P.W.10) who on       examination answered that the injuries
sustained by the deceased can be possible by such weapon and
therefore the hypothetical argument raised on behalf of the
appellant that M.O.I is not the weapon of offence cannot be
accepted. Learned counsel for the State submits that since there
is no infirmity in the impugned judgment and the order of
conviction, the appeal should be dismissed.
10.         We     have    thoughtfully  considered   the     rival
contentions vis-a-vis the evidences on record.

                                  13
             There is no dispute that the entire prosecution case
hinges on circumstantial evidence. It is aptly said that “man may
tell lies, but circumstances do not”. Circumstantial evidence is
evidence of relevant facts from which, one can, by process of
intuitive reasoning, infer about the existence of facts in issue or
factum     probandum.      While  assessing   the   case   based on
circumstantial evidence, the Court has a duty to see that the
circumstances on which the prosecution relies must be proved
beyond all reasonable doubt and such circumstances must be
capable of giving rise to an inference which is inconsistent with
any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused. It is only in
such an event that the conviction of the accused, on the basis of
the circumstantial evidence brought by the prosecution, would
be permissible in law. However the Court should be alert as the
circumstances can be created/concocted/planted in order to
falsely entangle a person on mere suspicion.
              In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda –v-
State of Maharastra reported in AIR 1984 SC 1622, their
Lordships have laid down five golden principles so as to
constitute “Panchasheel”        in the proof of a case based on
circumstantial evidence which are as follows:-
        1.    The circumstances from which the conclusion of
              guilt is to be drawn should be fully established;

                                 14
       2.     The facts so established should be consistent only
              with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused
              that is to say, they should not be explainable on
              any other hypothesis except that the accused is
              guilty;
       3.     The circumstances should be of a conclusive
              nature and tendency;
       4.     They should exclude every possible hypothesis
              except the one to be proved, and
       5.     There must be a chain of evidence so complete as
              not to leave any reasonable ground for the
              conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
              accused and must show that in all human
              probability the act must have been done by the
              accused.”
              In the case of Jaharlal Das v. State of Orissa,
reported in AIR 1991 SC 1388, it is held as follows:-
              “The Court has to bear in mind a caution that in
              cases depending largely upon circumstantial
              evidence, there is always a danger that the
              conjecture or suspicion may take the place of
              legal proof and such suspicion however so strong
              cannot be allowed to take the place of proof. The
              Court has to be watchful and ensure that
              conjectures and suspicions do not take the place
              of legal proof. The Court must satisfy itself that
              the various circumstances in the chain of evidence
              should be established clearly and that the
              completed chain must be such as to rule out a
              reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the
              accused”.
              In case of Budhuram –v- State of Chhattisgarh
reported in (2013)1 Supreme Court Cases (Criminal) 727,
it is held as follows:-

                                 15
              “The law relating to proof of a criminal charge by
              means of circumstantial evidence would hardly
              require any reiteration, save and except that the
              incriminating circumstances against the accused,
              on being proved, must be capable of pointing to
              only one direction and to no other, namely, that it
              is the accused and nobody else who had
              committed the crime. If the proved circumstances
              are capable of admitting any other conclusion
              inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, the
              accused must have the benefit of the same.”
              In case of Kanhaiya Lal –v- State of Rajasthan
reported in (2014) 2 Supreme Court Cases (Criminal) 413,
it is held as follows:-
              “Where a case rests squarely on circumstantial
              evidence, the inference of guilt can be justified
              only when all the incriminating facts and
              circumstances are found to be incompatible with
              the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any
              other person. The circumstances from which an
              inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn
              have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and
              have to be shown to be closely connected with the
              principal fact sought to be inferred from those
              circumstances.”
11.           Coming to the materials available on record, it is
very clear that the prosecution has failed to establish any motive
on the part of the appellant to commit the crime rather it is
apparent that both the appellant and the deceased were not only
labourers working under the same construction company but
they were also staying together in one of the quarters. Except
some evidence that sometimes they were quarreling with each
other under intoxication, nothing more has been established. In

                                 16
a case based on circumstantial evidence, motive assumes
pertinent   significance   as   existence  of  the  motive   is  an
enlightening factor in a process of presumptive reasoning in such
a case. The absence of motive, however, puts the Court on its
guard to scrutinize the circumstances more carefully to ensure
that suspicion and conjecture do not take place of legal proof.
The learned trial Court however observed that though there is no
clear and cogent evidence with regard to the motive for the
offence but there existed ill feeling between the two and it is only
the   perpetrator    of  the   crime   who    knows  as   to   what
circumstances prompted him to a certain course of action leading
to the commission of crime. The learned trial Court seems to
have relied on the evidence of P.W.3 who has stated that the
appellant and the deceased were quarreling with each other on
different times under intoxication. We are afraid that from this
one line statement of P.W.3, it cannot be conclusively held that
there was ill feeling between the two.      Drunkards’ intermittent
quarrel under the influence of liquor cannot be said to be an ill-
feeling between them. Thus, in view of the available materials on
record, we are of the view that the prosecution has failed
miserably to establish any kind of motive on the part of the
appellant to commit the crime.

                                17
12.         Since the prosecution has failed to establish any
motive on the part of the appellant, we are to scrutinize the
other circumstances available on record more carefully to see
whether the guilt of the appellant is established or not.
            The    next    important   circumstance    against   the
appellant is the last seen theory. The last seen theory comes into
play where the time gap between the point of time when the
accused and the deceased were last seen alive and the deceased
is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than
the accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible.
It would be difficult in some cases to positively establish that the
deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a long
gap and possibility of other persons coming in between exists. In
the absence of any other positive evidence to conclude that the
accused and the deceased were last seen together, it would be
hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases.
            Coming to the case in hand, P.W.2 has stated that
both the appellant and the deceased were staying together in
one of the half constructed quarters of the company which is
quarters no.121 in Block No.B/21 in Lingaraj Township. P.W.3
has also stated that the appellant and the deceased had been
staying together in quarters no.121 in Block No.B/21. He has
further stated that they were cooking separately and occupying

                                18
separate rooms and he had seen both of them in the semi
constructed quarters on the date of occurrence at about 11
p.m. in the night. P.W.6 has stated that the appellant and the
deceased had been staying together in one of the quarters in
Block No.21. The appellant has denied staying together with the
deceased in quarters no.121 in Block No.B/21 in his statement
recorded under section 313 Cr.P.C. but in view of the
categorical evidence of P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.6 relating to last
seen which has not been shaken in the cross-examination, we
are   of  the    view that   the   prosecution has  successfully
established that on the occurrence night, the appellant and the
deceased were together in the spot quarters and there was
none else in it.
            Similarly it is established through the evidence of
P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.6 that on the next day morning of the
occurrence, the deceased was found lying dead inside his room
in a pool of blood and the appellant was found absconding and
the room was locked from outside. Nothing has been brought
out in the cross-examination to discard this aspect of the
prosecution evidence.
            Thus from the materials available on record, it is
established that not only the appellant and the deceased were
staying together in one of the quarters of P.D. construction

                               19
company in Lingaraj Township but they were seen together in
the late hours of night on the date of occurrence and on the next
day morning, the dead body of the deceased was found in a pool
of blood and the appellant was found absconding and the room
was locked from outside. This piece of evidence is very clinching
against the appellant and the appellant is the best person who
was supposed to know in what manner and under what
circumstances, the deceased met his end but since the appellant
has failed to discharge his burden of proof and give a cogent,
probable and satisfactory explanation as to how the deceased
died and under what circumstances and why he absconded from
the spot, that itself would provide an additional link in the chain
of circumstances.
            The provisions of section 106 of the Evidence Act are
unambiguous and categoric in laying down that when any fact is
especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of
proving that fact is upon him. If he fails to offer an explanation
on the basis of facts within his special knowledge, he fails to
discharge the burden cast upon him by section 106 of the
Evidence Act. When the accused fails to throw any light upon
facts which are especially within his knowledge and which could
not support any theory or hypothesis compatible with his

                                20
innocence, the Court can consider his failure to adduce any
explanation as additional link which completes the chain.
           In case of Ajitsingh Harnamsingh Gujral -Vs.-
State of Maharashtra AIR 2011 SC 3690, it is held as
follows:-
           “29. The evidences of PW.3, PW 4 and PW 5,
           which we see no reason to disbelieve, thus
           fully establish that the Appellant was last seen
           with his wife at about midnight and was in fact
           quarrelling with her at that time.
           30. The incident happened at 4 or 4.30 a.m.
           and hence there was a time gap of only about
           4 hours from the time when the Appellant was
           seen with his wife (deceased) and the time of
           the incident. Thus he was last seen with his
           wife and there was only a short interval
           between this and the fire.
           31. The last seen theory comes into play
           where the time gap between the point of time
           when the accused and deceased were last
           seen alive and when the deceased is found
           dead is so small that the possibility of any
           person other than the accused being the
           author of the crime becomes impossible,
           vide Mohd. Azad alias Samin -Vrs.- State
           of West Bengal 2008 (15) SCC 449
           and State through Central Bureau of
           Investigation -Vrs.- Mahender             Singh
           Dahiya 2011 (3) SCC 109, Sk. Yusuf -
           Vrs.- State of West Bengal JT 2011 (6)
           SC 640 .
           32. In our opinion, since the accused was last
           seen with his wife and the fire broke out about
           4 hours thereafter it was for him to properly
           explain how this incident happened, which he

                             21
         has not done. Hence this is one of the strong
         links in the chain connecting the accused with
         the crime.
         33. The victims died in the house of the
         accused, and he was there according to the
         testimony of the above witnesses. The
         incident took place at a time when there was
         no outsider or stranger who would have
         ordinarily entered the house of the accused
         without resistance and moreover it was most
         natural for the accused to be present in his
         own house during the night”.
         In case of Babu S/o Raveendran -Vrs.- Babu S/o
Bahuleyan and Anr. reported in (2003) 7 SCC 37, it is held
that
         “14. The second important circumstantial
         evidence against the accused is that the
         accused and the deceased were last seen
         together. To put it tersely, both of them slept
         together by retiring to the room that night.
         Last seen together in legal parlance ordinarily
         refers to the last seen together in the street,
         at a public place, or at any place frequented
         by the public. But here, the last seen together
         is much more than that. The last seen
         together here is sleeping together inside the
         bolted room. It is in the evidence of PW-3 and
         PW-6 that they had dined together and the
         accused and the deceased were closeted in a
         room at about 8.30 p.m. Therefore, on the
         fateful day the accused and the deceased
         were closeted in a bedroom at about 8.30
         p.m. is undisputed and it is for the accused
         alone to explain as to what happened and how
         his wife died and that too on account of
         strangulation.

                                22
             xx              xx            xx             xx
            18. Now the question which remains to be
            considered is, who is responsible. As already
            noticed, the accused and the deceased were
            closeted inside the room. There is no evidence
            of an intruder. In such a situation, the
            circumstances leading to the death of the
            deceased are shifted to the accused. It is he
            who knows in what manner and in what
            circumstances the deceased has met her end
            and as to how the body with strangulation
            marks found its way into the nearby well. All
            the aforesaid circumstances, taken together
            cumulatively lead and unerringly point only to
            the guilt of the accused”.
            In    Trimukh     Maroti    Kirkan   –V-    State of
Maharashtra reported in 2006 AIR SCW 5300, the Apex
Court held that:
            “12. If an offence takes place inside the
            privacy of a house and in such circumstances
            where the assailants have all the opportunity
            to plan and commit the offence at the time
            and in circumstances of their choice, it will be
            extremely difficult for the prosecution to lead
            evidence to establish the guilt of the accused
            if the strict principle of circumstantial
            evidence, as noticed above, is insisted upon
            by the Courts. A Judge does not preside over
            a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent
            man is punished. A Judge also presides to see
            that a guilty man does not escape. Both are
            public duties……Where an offence like murder
            is committed in secrecy inside a house, the
            initial burden to establish the case would
            undoubtedly be upon the prosecution, but the
            nature and amount of evidence to be led by it

                                23
           to establish the charge cannot be of the same
           degree as is required in other cases of
           circumstantial evidence. The burden would be
           of a comparatively lighter character. In view
           of S. 106 of the Evidence Act there will be a
           corresponding burden on the inmates of the
           house to give a cogent explanation as to how
           the crime was committed. The inmates of the
           house cannot get away by simply keeping
           quiet and offering no explanation on the
           supposed premise that the burden to establish
           its case lies entirely upon the prosecution and
           there is no duty at all on an accused to offer
           any explanation”.
          In case of State of Rajasthan –V- Kashi Ram
reported in 2006 AIR SCW 5768, the Apex Court held that:
           “19…..whether an inference ought to be drawn
           under Section 106 Evidence Act is a question
           which must be determined by reference to
           facts proved. It is ultimately a matter of
           appreciation of evidence and, therefore, each
           case must rest on its own facts”.
           The Court further held that:
           “23.....The principle is well settled. The
           provisions of Section 106 of the Evidence Act
           itself are unambiguous and categoric in laying
           down that when any fact is especially within
           the knowledge of a person, the burden of
           proving that fact is upon him. Thus, if a
           person is last seen with the deceased, he
           must offer an explanation as to how and when
           he parted company. He must furnish an
           explanation which appears to the Court to be
           probable and satisfactory. If he does so he
           must be held to have discharged his burden.
           If he fails to offer an explanation on the basis
           of facts within his special knowledge, he fails

                                  24
              to discharge the burden cast upon him by
              Section 106 of the Evidence Act. In a case
              resting on circumstantial evidence if the
              accused fails to offer a reasonable explanation
              in discharge of the burden placed on him, that
              itself provides an additional link in the chain of
              circumstances       proved       against     him.
              Section 106 does not shift the burden of proof
              in a criminal trial, which is always upon the
              prosecution. It lays down the rule that when
              the accused does not throw any light upon
              facts which are specially within his knowledge
              and which could not support any theory or
              hypothesis compatible with his innocence, the
              Court can consider his failure to adduce any
              explanation, as an additional link which
              completes the chain”.
              The occurrence in this case took place in the
intervening     night   of  24th and 25th of       March, 2002. The
Investigating Officer searched for the whereabouts of the
accused and only on 01.04.2002 he was arrested and forwarded
to the Court on the next day. It is no doubt true that absconding
by itself is not conclusive either of guilt or of a guilty conscience
inasmuch as a person may abscond on account of fear of being
involved in the offence or for any other allied reason. Absconding
of accused leads no decisive implication, nevertheless it has
utility to form a link concatenate the full chain.
13.           There is clinching evidence that at the instance of the
appellant, the weapon of offence was recovered. It is the
contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the

                                25
seized crowbar is not the weapon of offence as the doctor has
stated that injury found on the body of the deceased was
possible by weapon like farsa having 6” length in the blade
portion.
            It appears from the records that during course of
investigation, the weapon of offence i.e. crowbar was sent by
Circle Inspector of Police, Talcher Circle to P.W.10 Dr. Santilata
Mohanty for examination and opinion as to whether the injuries
detected on the body of the deceased can be caused by such
weapon or not. P.W.10 examined the crowbar on the very same
day and found that the length of the crowbar is 61”, weight is 9
kg., diameter is 1” and circumference is 3” and it is made of iron
and one end is circular and the other end is rough and flat with
ragged border. She has opined that the injuries caused on the
deceased can be caused by the produced weapon and it can
cause death of the person.
            Unfortunately this opinion has not been proved
during course of trial by the public prosecutor though it is very
much available on record. It was not only the duty of the public
prosecutor to bring this document to the notice of the Medical
Officer as well as the trial Court and mark it as an exhibit but
also to show the seized weapon to the Medical Officer in Court to

                                26
get a positive statement that the very weapon was produced
before her to give the opinion.
             In case of Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma
-V- State reported in (2010) 46 Orissa Criminal Reports
208, it is held that a public prosecutor has a wider set of duties
than to merely ensure that accused is punished, the duties of
ensuring fair play in the proceedings, all relevant facts are
brought before the Court in order for the determination of truth
and justice for all the parties including the victims. It must be
noted that these duties do not allow the prosecutor to be lax in
any of his duties as against the accused. The Court must ensure
that the prosecutor is doing his duties with utmost level of
efficiency and fair play. In case of Joshinder Yadav –v- State
of Bihar reported in (2014) 57 Orissa Criminal Reports
(SC) 673, it is held that in a criminal trial, the Investigating
Officer, the prosecutor and the Court play a very important role.
The Court’s prime duty is to find out the truth. The Investigating
Officer, the prosecutor and the Courts must work in sync and
ensure that the guilty are punished by bringing on record
adequate credible legal evidence. If the Investigating Officer
stumbles, the prosecutor must pull him up and take necessary
steps to rectify the lacunae. The criminal Court must be alert, it
must oversee their actions and, in case, it suspects foul play, it

                                27
must use its vast powers and frustrate any attempt to set at
naught a genuine prosecution.
             In view    of  the  opinion given     by  P.W.10,   the
contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that crowbar
is not the weapon of the offence cannot be accepted.
14.          The non-finding of the blood stains either on the
crowbar or on the wearing apparels of the appellant is not very
material in view of the time gap between the date of occurrence
and arrest of the appellant and its seizure. The possibility of
cleaning and removing the blood stains by the appellant cannot
be ruled out.
15.          Thus we are of the view that it is none else but the
appellant who is the author of the crime. The facts so established
by the prosecution are consistent with the hypothesis of the guilt
of the appellant and the chain of evidence is complete and the
incriminating circumstances unmistakably and inevitably lead to
an irresistible conclusion regarding the guilt of the appellant.
16.           Coming to the alternative argument, the learned
counsel for the appellant contended that since no motive for the
commission of crime has been established and possibility of
sudden quarrel between the parties cannot be ruled out so also
the occurrence happening on the spur of the moment and the
appellant committing the act, whilst deprived of the power of

                                28
self-control by grave and sudden provocation can also not be
ruled out, it would not attract the ingredients of the offence
under section 302 Indian Penal Code. The learned counsel
further contended that P.W.3 has categorically stated that
sometimes the appellant and the deceased were quarreling with
each other under intoxication. It is further contended that since
a single blow has been inflicted, in facts and circumstances of
the case, the appellant may be liable for commission of offence
under section 304 Part-I of Indian Penal Code.
             Learned counsel for the State conversely argued that
there is no universal rule that infliction of a single blow could not
attract section 302 IPC rather it depends on the manner in which
the blow is inflicted and the surrounding circumstances. It is
further argued that a stab wound of size 6” x 3” x 3” has been
caused on the neck with a crowbar which has caused separation
of cervical 4th and 5th vertebra and severance of spinal cord,
internal jugular vein and internal carotid on the left side neck
was cut and injuries have been opined to be sufficient in ordinary
course of nature to cause death. The learned counsel further
urged that in absence of any material to show that the case is
covered under any of the five exceptions as enumerated under
section 300 Indian Penal Code, it cannot be a case of culpable

                                 29
homicide not amounting to murder falling either under section
304 Part-I or 304 Part-II of Indian Penal Code.
             Considering the rival contentions raised at the bar
and the evidences produced before the trial Court, it is apparent
that not only the deceased and the appellant were working as
labourers under the same contractor but they were also staying
together in one quarters. Sometimes there use to be quarrel
between them in a state of intoxication but in spite of such
quarrel, they continue to stay together under the same roof, of
course in two separate rooms. They were seen by P.W.2
preparing their respective foods in evening hours on the date of
occurrence. They were also seen in the late night together by
P.W.3. At that point of time there is no evidence of any quarrel
between the two. Absence of any motive and in view of passed
conduct of the parties quarreling with each other under influence
of liquor suggests that on the date of occurrence also, the
possibility of quarrel between the two in the late night cannot be
ruled out. In all possibility, the quarrel escalated into a serious
fight between the two and the appellant being deprived of power
of self control and causing injury on the deceased by dealing a
blow with a crowbar can also not be ruled out. The appellant
must have got opportunity to inflict more than one injury but he
did not do so.

                                30
             In case of Surendra Kumar -V- Union Territory,
Chandigarh reported in AIR 1989 SC 1094, it was held that
in   order   to  invoke   exception   4   section   300   IPC,  four
requirements must be satisfied, namely (i) it was a sudden fight;
(ii) there was no premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a heat
of passion; (iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage
or acted in a cruel manner. The cause of quarrel is not relevant
nor is it relevant who offered provocation or started assault. The
number of wounds caused during the occurrence is not a decisive
factor but what is important is that the occurrence must have
been sudden and unpremeditated and the offender must have
acted in a fit of anger. Of course, the offender must not have
taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner. Where,
on a sudden quarrel, a person in the heat of the moment picks
up a weapon which is handy and causes injuries, one of which
proved fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of this exception
provided he has not acted cruelly.
             The appellant has used a crowbar as the weapon of
offence    which   must  have    been   readily   available  at  the
construction site. He has dealt only one blow in spite of getting
ample opportunity to deal more number of blows and the said
single blow unfortunately has been proved fatal. Happening of
the unforeseen occurrence during sudden quarrel and the

                               31
appellant acting in a fit of anger and in an unpremeditated
manner cannot be ruled out. We are of the considered view that
even though the act of the appellant had resulted in the death of
the deceased but it was caused not with the intention of causing
death but causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause
death. The intention is the state of mind which can be inferred
from the facts and circumstances of each case particularly the
nature of weapon used, whether the weapon was carried by the
accused or was picked up from the spot, how it was used, the
nature of injuries inflicted, whether there was any grave and
sudden provocation, whether the accused had taken undue
advantage or had acted in a cruel and unusual manner, whether
the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. These are some
of the special circumstances which with reference to the
individual cases may throw light on the question of intention.
Where direct evidence is not available, Court can still look into
the surrounding circumstantial evidence to find out the intention
aspect of the accused to commit the crime.
            In case of Amrithalinga Nadar -V- State of Tamil
Nadu reported in AIR 1976 SC 1133, where the appellant
caused injury on the left side neck of the deceased by a sharp
edged weapon which was sufficient in ordering course of nature
to  cause   death,  the   Hon’ble  Supreme    Court  altered  the

                               32
conviction from one under section 302 IPC to 304 Part-I IPC. In
case of Kulesh Mondal –V- State of West Bengal reported
in AIR 2007 SC 3228 where a fatal blow on the neck was given
with a ‘hasua’ the Hon’ble Suprme Court set aside the conviction
of the appellant under section 302 Indian Penal Code and
convicted him under section 304 Part-I Indian Penal Code and
sentenced him to custodial sentence of ten years. In case of
Arumugam –V- State reported in AIR 2009 SC 331 where
the appellant stabbed the deceased on his right neck with spike
which pierced through the neck of the deceased and came out on
the left side, Hon’ble Supreme Court altered the conviction from
one under section 302 IPC to section 304 Part-I IPC.
             Taking overall view of all these facts, we are of the
view that the appellant has committed culpable homicide not
amounting to murder and his act falls within part-I of section
304 of Indian Penal Code.
             In the result, we set aside the impugned judgment
and order of conviction of the appellant under section 302 Indian
Penal Code and imposition of sentence of life imprisonment as
well as payment of fine of Rs.2000/-, in default to undergo R.I.
for six months more as was imposed by the learned trial Court.
On the contrary, we convict the appellant under section 304
Part-I Indian penal Code. It is stated at the Bar that the

                                                 33
       appellant is in custody since 02.04.2002 and in the meantime
       more than thirteen years have passed. We verified the records
       and found the statement made by the learned counsel for the
       appellant to be correct. Therefore while convicting the appellant
       under section 304 Part-I Indian Penal Code, we sentence him to
       the period already undergone. The appellant who is in jail
       custody shall be released forthwith if his detention is not
       otherwise required in any other case.
                              Accordingly, Criminal Appeal is allowed in part.
                              Lower Court records along with a copy of this
       judgment be sent down to the learned trial Court for necessary
       action.
