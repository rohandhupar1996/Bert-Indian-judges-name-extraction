           PRESENT:
                          THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI
                        Date of hearing: 31.08.2015 : Date of judgment : 08.10.2015
Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.        All the writ petitions mentioned above having similar cause of
           action, have been heard together and are disposed of by this common
           judgment. For better appreciation, it would suffice to state the fact of W.P.(C)
           No.19596 of 2010 for consideration of the matters.

                                          15
2.                W.P.(C) No.19596 of 2010 has been filed to quash the
Gradation List of Trained Graduate Teachers of aided High Schools of
Kendrapara Circle, Kendrapara in Annexure-1. Similarly the placement in the
Gradation List of Trained Graduate Teachers of aided High Schools of
different circles of the State has been sought to be quashed by the petitioners
in the other writ petitions mentioned in the cause title.
3.               The factual matrix in W.P.(C) No.19596 of 2010 is that the
petitioner was initially appointed as Assistant Teacher on 20.01.1989 by the
Managing Committee of Narendra Gunjari Bidyapitha, Gharabanjakolha
pursuant to its Resolution No.47. The petitioner having qualification of M.A.
B.Ed. was appointed as Headmaster by the Managing Committee, but his
services were approved as Headmaster-in-Charge by the Circle Inspector of
Schools on 04.11.1995. After approval of his post as Headmaster-in-Charge,
the Managing Committee passed a Resolution on 25.01.1996 for sanction of
Headmaster’s Scale of pay to him. As per the yardstick, the Government has
stipulated the staffing pattern of a High School consisting of four Assistant
Teachers and one Headmaster. The method of Recruitment and Conditions of
Service Rules, 1993 provides only two grades in a School i.e. Junior Grade
and Senior Grade as per Sub Rule-3 of Rule-3 of the said Rules whereas
Senior Grade confines the post of , Junior Grade includes Asst. Teacher.
Neither the Rules nor the Staffing pattern indicates the post of Headmaster-
in-Charge, but the Inspector of Schools approved the post of the petitioner as
Headmaster-in-Charge which is contrary to the Rules. The Government of
Orissa, Department of School and Mass Education issued a circular on
12.05.1993 stating that the persons appointed as Headmaster-in-Charge

                                         16
shall be paid Headmaster’s Scale of pay by relaxing seven years of teaching
experience as required under law. Since the case of the petitioner comes
under the said circular dated 12.05.1993 and similarly situated person like
that of the petitioner, namely, Purna Chandra Khadanga was granted
Headmaster’s scale of pay, the petitioner approached the State Education
Tribunal in G.I.A. Case No.227/2009 under Section 24-B of the Orissa
Education Act, 1969 claiming Headmaster’s scale of pay with effect from
01.06.1994 along with all consequential benefits. The learned Tribunal
instead of adjudicating the matter in proper perspective, directed the State
authorities to consider the case of the petitioner in the light of principles
decided in the case of Pabitra Mohan Dash etc. v. State of Orissa and
others, AIR 2001 SC 560 : (2001) 2 SCC 480 and State of Orissa and
others v. Subhranta Kumar Mohanty and another, (2003) 12 SCC 53
within a reasonable period. Due to non-grant of such benefit, the petitioner
has approached this Court by filing the writ petition. Hence this case.
4.              Mr. P.K. Rath, learned counsel for the petitioner in course of
hearing confines his prayer to placement of the petitioner in the Gradation
List of Trained Graduate Teacher of the aided High Schools of Kendrapara
Circle, Kendrapara Annexure-1 and so far as the claim of Headmaster’s scale
of pay is concerned, he has abandoned such prayer. It is urged that such
Gradation List was prepared in violation of the provision of Section 10-C (2)
of the Orissa Education Act. Therefore, the placement of the petitioner in the
Gradation List is contrary to the provisions of law.
5.              Mr. A.K. Pandey, learned Standing Counsel for the School
and Mass Education Department vehemently disputes the question raised by

                                          17
the learned counsel for the petitioner and submits that effectively the
petitioner has claimed the Headmaster’s scale of pay admissible to the post
and this question has already been considered in Pabitra Mohan Dash
(supra). Therefore, nothing more can be considered by this Court in the
present case. So far as consideration of placement of the petitioner in the
Gradation List prepared by the authority in Annexure-1 is concerned, he
urged that it is the camouflage approach of the petitioner for claiming the
benefit which he is not entitled to get directly but he wants to get it indirectly.
Therefore, this Court should not be utilized for the purpose which has
already been settled by the apex Court in Pabitra Mohan Dash (supra). It is
urged that the petitioner acquired B.Ed. qualification on 12.01.1988 and
Regulation-17 of the Board of Secondary Education, Orissa which came into
force on 29.05.1977 makes it obligatory that every institution to have a
Headmaster who must be a Trained Graduate and must have 7 years of
teaching experience as a Trained Graduate Teacher and after 29.05.1977 if
any appointment has been made to the post of Headmaster contrary to the
aforesaid provisions of the Regulation then the said appointment would be
invalid and would not confer any right on the appointee. Since the petitioner
acquired   the  B.Ed.    qualification   on   12.01.1988,   he   is  eligible   for
consideration for the post of Headmaster after completion of 7 years i.e. after
12.01.1995. Accordingly, the appointment of the petitioner to the post of
Headmaster vide order dated 20.01.1989 by the Managing Committee is void
ab initio and does not confer any right on the petitioner to claim the benefit
of Headmaster’s Scale of pay. Being a Trained Graduate Teacher his post was
approved in the scale of pay of Rs.1400-2600 which is the scale of pay of an

                                          18
Asst. Teacher. He was kept as in-charge Headmaster of the School which is
not a substantive post and he never objected to the benefit attached to the
post of TGT but questioning the same after a period of 15 years which is not
sustainable in the eye of law. Therefore, at the belated stage the benefit
cannot be granted to the petitioner and the placement of the petitioner in the
Gradation List in Annexure-1 is absolutely in consonance with the provisions
of law. It is further urged that in view of Rule-8 (3) of the Orissa Education
(Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Teachers and Members of the Staff
of Aided Educational Institutions) Rules 1974 (hereinafter referred to 1974
Rules) vacancies in the posts of Headmasters of aided Boys’ High Schools and
Headmistress of the Girls’ High Schools under the fold of the system of direct
payment of full salary cost shall be filled up by the eligible Trained Graduate
Teachers of respective categories of High Schools from the select list prepared
by the Selection Board in the manner prescribed in the Regulation framed by
the Selection Board for the purpose, on the basis of the recommendation of a
committee to be constituted by the Government which shall be headed by the
Director. The selection shall be made on the basis of seniority in the common
feeding cadre and performance. The zone of consideration shall be thrice the
number of vacancies. The promotion to the post of Headmaster is only be
given by following the procedure laid down in Rule 8(3) of the 1974 Rules.
Therefore, the claim of the petitioner that he should be granted Headmaster’s
Scale of pay is absolutely misconceived one and fixation of Seniority and
placement of the petitioner in the Gradation List in Annexure-1 taking into
consideration the date acquisition of B.Ed qualification by the authority is

                                               19
justified and as such no illegality and irregularity has been committed by the
authority.
6.               On the facts pleaded above, Mr. P.K. Rath, learned counsel
and other learned counsels appearing in the other writ petitions have
abandoned the claim of Headmaster’s scale of pay. Therefore, this Court is
not going to make any observation or issue any direction contrary to the
settled principles of law laid down by the apex Court in Pabitra Mohan Dash
(supra). Only question to be considered by this Court is whether the
placement of the petitioner in the Gradation List has been done in
accordance with the provisions contained in Section-10 (C)(2) of the Orissa
Education Act or not. For better appreciation Section-10 (C) (2) is quoted
below:
                     Section-10-C.   Constitution   of   Common    Cadre    and  its
                 consequences.
                     (2) Before constitution of a common cadre under Sub-Section
                 (1)-The Director, in case of Colleges, and the Inspector of Schools
                 having jurisdiction, in case of Schools, shall furnish detailed
                 information relating to the terms and conditions of service
                 prescribed for such cadre to every employee belonging to that
                 cadre with a notice requiring him to exercise his option within
                 such period, not being less than thirty days and more than forty-
                 five days as may be specified therein for absorption or otherwise
                 in such cadre.
                 On perusal of the aforementioned provisions, it is clear that
before constitution of a common cadre under Sub-Section (1) the Inspector of
Schools having jurisdiction shall furnish detailed information relating to the
terms and conditions of service prescribed for such cadre to every employee
belonging to that cadre with a notice requiring him to exercise his option
within such period, not being less than thirty days and more than forty-five
days as may be specified therein for absorption or otherwise in such cadre.
Such option shall be exercised in writing and shall be filed with the Inspector

                                         20
of Schools and any employee who fails to exercise option within the aforesaid
period shall be deemed to have opted for being absorbed in the common
cadre. Sub-Clause(5) of Section 10 (C) provides that where an employee of
Educational Institution exercises his option for not being absorbed in the
common cadre the Managing Committee, or as the case may be, the
Governing Body of the Institution shall terminate the services of such
employee within fifteen days from the date of receipt of an intimation to that
effect from the Inspector of Schools and the provisions of Section 10-A shall
not apply to any such termination. An employee belonging to a common
cadre may be transferred from one institution to another by the Prescribed
Authority in the prescribed manner. In any case, it is urged that Section 10-C
(2) has not been complied with while preparing the Gradation List under
Annexure-1. Nothing has been spelt out to that extent in the counter affidavit
filed by the opposite party-State, rather the counter affidavit is silent on that
score.
7.              Mr. A.K. Pandey, learned Standing Counsel for the School
and Mass Education Department urged that there was no occasion to raise
before this Court with regard to the compliance of the provisions contained in
Section-10-C (2) in course of hearing rather it is contrary to the law laid down
by the apex Court in Pabitra Mohan Dash (supra). Since the petitioner has
abandoned the claim of Headmaster’s scale of pay as pleaded in the writ
petition and only assailed the placement of the petitioner in the Gradation
List of Trained Graduate Teachers in Kendrapara Circle, Kendrapara, that
should be in consonance with the provisions contained in Section-10(C)(2) of
the Orissa Education Act.

                                        21
8.              Law is well settled that question of law can be raised at any
point of time. Therefore, the compliance of provisions contained in Section
10-C (2) is required under the law which has been urged before this Court
and accordingly, the same has been taken into consideration. It is therefore
observed that while preparing the Gradation List if the authority has not
complied with the provisions contained in Section-10-C(2) of the Orissa
Education Act, the placement of the petitioner in the said Gradation List is
contrary to the said provisions and the authority has to follow the mandate of
law as enshrined under Section 10-C(2) of the Act.
9.              In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, this Court
directs the respective Circle Inspectors of Schools to examine whether while
preparing the Gradation List the provisions contained in Section 10-C(2) has
been followed or not. If the same has been complied with then the Gradation
lists so prepared would be acted upon and if the same has not been complied
with then the authority shall comply with the same and prepare the
Gradation List in consonance with the provisions of law as expeditiously as
possible.
19.             With the above observation and direction, these writ petitions
stand disposed of.
                                                 ………………………..
                                                   Dr.B.R.Sarangi, J.
