                 This case was heard on 18.08.2015 and today is fixed for
delivery of judgment. Accordingly, judgment is dictated in the open Court.
2.               Heard Mr. D. Saikia, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. S.
Bora, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. K. N. Choudhury, learned Sr.
Counsel assisted by Mr. N. Deka, learned counsel for respondent Nos. 2, 3
and the newly added respondent No. 5 and Mr. S. K. Medhi, learned

3.               By filing this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India petitioner seeks quashing of office order dated 20.05.2015 issued by
the Commissioner, Assam State Housing Board engaging respondent No. 4
as Chief Engineer (Honorary) temporarily for a period of 6 (six) months from
the date of joining to prepare plan and estimate and to supervise/monitor
the ongoing construction works carried out by Assam State Housing Board
as well as the joint venture projects undertaken by the Assam State
Housing Board.

4.               Case of the petitioner is that he had joined Assam State
Housing Board (Board) as Assistant Engineer in the year 1984. He was
promoted to the post of Superintending Engineer w.e.f. 28.12.2006 in
which capacity he is also functioning as Chief Assam State Housing Board
Engineer. According to the petitioner, he has been responsible for pointing
out various acts of omissions and commissions in the Board for which he
has been sought to be sidelined by the higher authorities of the Board. It is
in this backdrop that the impugned order came to be issued. By the
impugned order, a retired employee (respondent No. 4) has been engaged as
Chief Engineer (Honorary) in the Board undermining the office and
authority of the petitioner.
5.               Contention of the petitioner is that such engagement of
respondent No. 4 is illegal because no prior approval was taken from the
Government. It is also contrary to various guidelines issued by the
Personnel Department, Government of Assam dated 25.05.1995 and
20.05.2015. Such appointment will undermine the morale of the serving
officers and employees and lead to confusion in the office. Besides it has
also undermined the service status of the petitioner as because due to the
super imposition of respondent No. 4, he has become the focal point of
authority in the Board. With this grievance, present writ petition has been
filed.
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                          Page 3 of 13

6.               This Court vide order dated 21.05.2015 had issued notice and
passed an interim order to the effect that office order dated 20.05.2015
would stand suspended subject to the condition that respondent No. 4 had
not already taken over charge of the assignment.
7.               Respondent Nos. 2 & 3 in their common affidavit have taken
the stand that the Board is a statutory body incorporated under Section 3
of the Assam State Housing Board Act, 1972 and is not a department of
Govt. of Assam. Therefore, the two office memoranda relied upon by the
petitioner would not be attracted in the present case. It is further
contended that petitioner does not have locus standi to challenge
engagement of respondent No. 4 as he is only holding the post of Chief
Housing Board Engineer which is in the cadre of Superintending Engineer.
Engagement of respondent No. 4 in no way causes any prejudice or affects
the service status or conditions of service of the petitioner. In any case,
respondent No. 4 has been engaged for a limited period of 6 (six) months for
specific works. [Though averments have been made regarding the personal
conduct of the petitioner, Court is of the view that it is not necessary to
enter into such issues as the sole issue before the Court is the legality and
validity of the impugned office order dated 20.05.2015.] Allegations made
by the petitioners have been denied. No new post has been created for
engagement of respondent No. 4. His appointment is purely temporary for a
fixed period of 6 (six) months. Therefore, prior approval of the State
Government is not necessary. It is further stated that respondent No. 4 had
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                            Page 4 of 13

already joined his new assignment at 10:00 a.m. on 21.05.2015 and
thereafter submitted his joining report. Service conditions of the employees
of the Board are governed by the provisions of Assam State Housing
Board (Salaries, Allowances and Conditions of Services) Regulations,
1988. It is however clarified that Chairman of the Board is appointed by
the Government.
8.               Respondent No. 4 in his affidavit has also taken a similar stand
as that of respondent Nos. 2 & 3. He has stated that his engagement has
got nothing to do and will not hamper in any manner functioning of the
petitioner as Chief Housing Board Engineer of the Board. It is further
stated that his engagement is on a temporary basis for a period of 6 (six)
months at a fixed remuneration. Therefore, there is no violation of the
service regulations or of any office memorandum.
9.               In his rejoinder affidavit, petitioner has stated that it has been
the past practice in the Board to seek the approval of the Government
whenever any appointment of retired person was sought to be made.
10.              Mr. Saikia, learned Sr. Counsel for the petitioner submits that
impugned engagement of respondent No. 4 is in violation of Section 12 of
the Assam State Housing Board Act, 1972 (Act). Referring to the said
provision, he submits that the Board shall not appoint any officer in scale
of pay the maximum of which exceeds Rs.1200.00 a month without
obtaining the previous sanction of the State Government. In the present
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                                 Page 5 of 13

case, not to speak of previous sanction, not even ex facto approval has been
sought for. Such appointment would also be in violation of the guidelines
laid down by the State Government in the Office memorandum dated
25.05.1995, whereby it has been clarified amongst others that no person
should be re-employed/employed on contract basis by any Department
beyond the age of superannuation in anticipation of approval of the
Personnel Department, concurrence of Finance Department and approval of
the Chief Minister and Cabinet. He submits that provisions of the aforesaid
office memorandum are applicable also to Boards like the present one.
Such clarification/note of caution has been reiterated by the recent office
memorandum of the Govt. of Assam, Personnel Department dated
20.05.2015, whereby it has been clarified that re-employment of retired
employees does not benefit the Government but on the contrary, it
discourages        development of competencies   amongst    the     lower level
employees to take up higher responsibilities. As per the said office
memorandum, all proposals for engagement of retired employees on
contract basis for a period more than 6 (six) months should have the
approval of the High Level Scrutiny Committee and concurrence of the
Finance Department, subject to approval of the Cabinet. It was also pointed
out that such officials should not be allowed to hold any cadre post and
should not also be allowed to write/put up note in Government records or
sign documents or take any decision on behalf of the Government. Mr.
Saikia therefore contends that taking into consideration the above, sudden
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                           Page 6 of 13

engagement of respondent No. 4 as Chief Engineer (Honorary) is wholly
untenable. He, therefore, seeks interference of the Court in the matter.
11.              Per contra, Mr. K. N. Choudhury, learned Sr. Counsel for
respondent Nos. 2, 3 & 5 submits that first of all petitioner is not a person
aggrieved. Engagement of respondent No. 4 as Chief Engineer (Honorary) in
no way effects the service conditions of the petitioner. Therefore, he cannot
have any grievance to such engagement of respondent No. 4. If he is not a
person aggrieved petitioner would not have the locus to maintain the writ
petition. Secondly, he submits that engagement of respondent No. 4 is
purely temporary for a period of 6 (six) months only. It is not an
appointment against any cadre post having any pay scale. He further
submits that temporary engagement of respondent No. 4 is at remuneration
of Rs. 20,000.00 per month with monthly conveyance allowance of Rs.
2500.00. Such engagement of respondent No. 4 has been made keeping in
mind the administrative requirements of the Board since the Board is
presently executing a number of projects on behalf of the State Government
as well as on behalf of several joint venture companies. An expert hand is
required to monitor execution of such schemes. Since the engagement of
respondent No. 4 is not an appointment against a particular post having
definite pay scale, question of applicability of section 12 of the Act does not
arise which only prohibits appointment of an officer with pay scale
exceeding Rs. 1200.00 per month without obtaining the previous sanction
of the State Government. Referring to the two office memoranda dated
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                             Page 7 of 13

25.05.1995 and 20.05.2015, Mr. Choudhury submits that since the Board
is a statutory body having its independent existence, State Government
guidelines laid down by such office memoranda would not be attracted to
the case in hand which in any case is not a re-employment of respondent
No. 4. As such, in matters such as these, personal perception and
nomenclature of the assignment would be of little consequence. He,
therefore, submits that there is no merit in the writ petition which should
be dismissed.
12.              Mr. Medhi, learned counsel for respondent No. 4 has also made
his submissions on similar lines as that of Mr. Choudhury. Additionally, he
submits that considering the past service record of respondent No. 4 and
his expertise in matters relating to construction, the Board has thought it
fit to utilize his service in advisory capacity and has accordingly engaged
him temporarily for a period of 6 (six) months. He submits that
nomenclature of the assignment is             clearly irrelevant as obviously
respondent No. 4 cannot function as Chief Engineer of the Board. He also
submits that respondent No. 4 had joined his assignment on 21.05.2015 in
the forenoon and is functioning as such since then. Writ petition should
therefore be dismissed.
13.              Mr. Saikia, in his reply submissions had contended that
inspite of clear embargo and the interim order of this Court respondent No.
4 is functioning as Chief Engineer of the Board and signing office note
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                             Page 8 of 13

sheets of the Board. In this connection, petitioner has also filed a contempt
case against the respondent No. 4, which has been registered as Contempt
Case (C) No. 356/2015.
14.              Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties have
received the due and anxious consideration of the Court.
15.              Since the entire controversy centers round the office order
dated 20.05.2015, it would be apposite to refer to the same at the outset.
Office order dated 20.05.2015 reads as under:-
                 “ NO.SHB/G/Esstt/39/2013/25                           Dated, Guwahti the 20.05.2015
                                                    OFFICE ORDER
                         In the interest of Board’s Service Sri Niren Mazumdar, Chief Engineer (Rtd.),
                 Assam State Warehousing Corporation is hereby engaged as Chief Engineer (Honorary),
                 Assam State Housing Board to prepare plan & estimate and supervise/monitor the
                 ongoing construction works of various Departments entrusted to the Assam State
                 Housing Board by the Govt. of Assam and Joint Venture Projects undertaken by the
                 Assam State Housing Board temporarily for six months from the date of joining.
                         A remuneration of Rs. 20,000,00 (Rupees Twenty thousand) only and
                 conveyance allowance of Rs.2,500.00 only per month shall be paid to him out of the
                 Agency Charge being received by the Board from various Central & State Govt.
                 Department etc. against the entrusted works.
                         This has the approval of the Hon’ble Chairman, Assam State Housing Board.
                                                                              Commissioner,
                                                                       Assam State Housing Board,
                                                                     R.G. Baruah Road, Guwahti-05."
16.              A careful perusal of the impugned office order would show that
respondent No. 4 has been engaged as Chief Engineer (Honorary) of the
Board to prepare plan and estimate and supervise/monitor the ongoing
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                                              Page 9 of 13

construction works of various departments entrusted to the Board by the
Govt. of Assam and the joint venture projects undertaken by the Board. His
engagement is temporary for a period of 6 (six) months from the date of
joining. Respondent No. 4 would be entitled to a remuneration of
Rs. 20,000.00 only and conveyance allowance of Rs. 2,500.00 per month;
the said office order had the approval of the Chairman of the Board.
17.              Thus the nature of engagement of respondent No. 4 is
temporary and for a period of 6 (six) months on fixed remuneration. The job
assigned to him is to prepare plan and estimate and to supervise and
monitor the ongoing construction works. Respondent No. 3 has been
careful enough to use the expression “engage” instead of the word
“appointment” while issuing the impugned order dated 20.05.2015.
18.              Sub-section (1) of the Section 12 of the Act empowers the
Board to have such officers and employees as may be considered necessary
for the efficient performance of its functions. However, the proviso to Sub-
section (1) states that the Board shall not appoint any officer with pay scale
exceeding Rs.1200.00 without obtaining the previous sanction of the State
Government. Since temporary engagement of respondent No. 4 for 6 (six)
months at fixed pay is per se not an appointment to any post having a pay
scale, provisions of Section 12 of the Act may not be applicable in an
engagement of such nature.
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                           Page 10 of 13

19.              The two office memoranda also do not expressly debar the
Government departments and other statutory bodies from re-employing
retired persons but have sounded a note of caution that such re-
employment should ordinarily not be resorted to but if at all it becomes
necessary, then to follow the procedure laid down in such office
memoranda.
20.              Mr. Choudhury is right in contending that the Board is not a
department of the State Government and therefore the guidelines laid down
by the two office memoranda may not be attracted to the Board stricto
senso. To the extent of engagement of respondent No. 4 on temporary basis
for a period of 6 (six) months having fixed monthly remuneration there may
not be much difficulty. To that extent Court may not like to interfere with
the decision of respondent Nos. 2, 3 & 5 to engage respondent No. 4
temporarily for 6 (six) months.
21.              Having said that, the assignment given to respondent No. 4, a
retired officer, on his engagement post retirement needs to be careful
examined. On a minute examination of the impugned order, it becomes
evident that the task given to respondent No. 4 is to prepare plan and
estimate and to supervise/monitor the ongoing construction work. Such an
assignment is therefore supervisory and advisory in nature. If that be so,
describing respondent No. 4 as Chief Engineer (Honorary) of the Board may
not be justified for more than one reason. Firstly, there is no post
WP(C) No.2975/2015                                             Page 11 of 13

equivalent to or called Chief Engineer (Honorary) in the Board. Secondly,
the description of the engagement of respondent No. 4 as Chief Engineer
indicates a particular hierarchy in the cadre having definite powers and
responsibilities. Therefore, a retired employee on his re-engagement post
retirement if he is assigned such a job, it is bound to create confusion and
breach of hierarchy in the Board. In such circumstances, Court is of the
view that since respondent No. 4 has been primarily engaged post
retirement in a supervisory and advisory character, it would be proper if
the    nomenclature      of such    assignment   is changed    to    reflect the
supervisory/advisory nature of the engagement. It is also necessary to
ensure that since respondent No. 4 has been engaged temporarily for a
period of 6 (six) months in a supervisory/monitoring assignment,
respondent Nos. 2, 3 & 5 should ensure that no official files are routed
through the respondent No. 4 and that he does not sign in the official
record or be a part of the decision making process. His engagement is
outside the cadre framework of the Board and he would discharge his
duties purely in supervisory or advisory manner.
22.              Necessary modification in the nomenclature of the assignment
of respondent No. 4 and detailed instructions relating to his job profile shall
be issued by respondent Nos. 2, 3 & 5 within 7 (seven) days from the date
of receipt of a certified copy of this order.

23.              Subject to the above, Court would not like to interfere with the
temporary engagement of respondent No. 4 in the Board.
24.              Writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
