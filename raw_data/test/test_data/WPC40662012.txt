                            Date of Hearing :        18-08-2015

                                  JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
                   In this writ petition, the petitioner is questioning the legality of the
            selection of the respondent No. 5 by the Selection Board for appointment
            to the post of Assistant Professor in Chemistry for J.B. College, Jorhat.
            2.     Apparently, the petitioner has impressive academic credentials.
            She passed her HSLC, HSSC, B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Chemistry and IIT
            Examination in First Class and obtained PH.D in Chemistry, cleared NET
            for lectureship in the year 2003 and qualified in graduate aptitude test in
            Engineering in the year 2004. In response to the advertisement
            published in the Website of J.B College, she applied for the post of
            Assistant Professor in Chemistry: she fulfilled UGC norms with
            NET/SLET/SET. She duly appeared before the Selection Board on 17-5-
            2012 and hoped to be selected considering her good performance in the
            interview. However, the respondent No. 5 was recommended by the
            Selection Board for the said post whereupon the Governing Body of the
            College adopted the resolution dated 12-6-2012 resolving to appoint him
            for the post. The respondent No. 4 thereafter forwarded the name of the
            respondent No. 5 for his approval, and the same is pending. According to
            the petitioner, the Selection Board while making distribution of marks to
            the   petitioner   intentionally   withheld   2   marks   for  the  sub-head
            “Presentation of Paper in Seminar/Workshop” under the head of
            “Research Performance” of the candidates though presentation of paper
            in National level seminar organised by the Department of Chemistry,
            Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and publication of the abstract
            were available on record.
            3.     On the other hand, the Selection Board placed the respondent No.
            5 in the 1st position with higher consolidated marks of 60.26 and placed
            the petitioner in the 2nd position with 59.04 marks, which is illegal and
            contrary to the marks distribution procedure followed in the selection
WP(C) No. 4066/2012                                                                     Page 2 of 8

            procedure for the post of Assistant Professor or in colleges as per UGC
            guidelines, 2010 circulated vide the letter dated 13-12-2011 of the
            respondent No. 2. According to the petitioner, under the said guidelines,
            the candidates under the head of Research Performance for paper
            presentation are entitled to get 2 marks for each presentation of paper in
            International/National Seminar/Workshop subject to the maximum of 5
            marks, but the Selection Board did not take into account her
            presentation of paper in National Level seminar organised by the
            Department of Chemistry, IIT, Madras and her participation certificate
            issued by the competent authority with relevant extracts and deliberately
            omitted to give 2 marks with a view to favour the respondent No. 5. It is
            contended by the petitioner that both the recommendation of the
            Selection Board and the resolution of the Governing Body for the
            appointment of the respondent No. 5 for the said post are vitiated and
            cannot be sustained in law.
            4.      Resisting the writ petition, the respondent No. 3 and 4, in their
            affidavit-in-opposition, refuted the contentions of the petitioner by
            stating that the candidates were properly interviewed and their
            documents were verified in accordance with the UGC guidelines issued
            on 13-12-2011: the respondent No. 5 secured the highest marks and was
            accordingly selected for the post. It is the case of the answering
            respondents that the petitioner had simply indicated in Annexure-I
            enclosed     with   her   application    that  she   had   attended   the
            symposia/seminar      but  without    any   supporting documents.    Even
            assuming for the sake of argument, submits the answering respondents,
            that she had presented a Paper in the seminar, she ought to have clearly
            indicated the same to the Committee along with the title of the paper so
            presented instead of simply mentioning the theme of the seminar
            attended by her. The respondent No. 4 avers that even though he was
            one of the members of the Selection Committee, he came to know about
            the presentation of a paper in a National Level Seminar only after
            perusing this writ petition. He also further states that though the
            occasion was the 12th Biennial Symposium on Modern Trends in
            Inorganic Chemistry held at the Department of Chemistry, Indian
WP(C) No. 4066/2012                                                               Page 3 of 8

            Institute of Technology, Madras, it is not clear whether seminar was
            national or international or whether it is a poster or lecture: marks can
            be   legitimately  awarded    by   the  Committee    only  in   respect   of
            national/international level seminars/workshops attended and, that too,
            only for presentation of papers and not for mere participation.
            5.      The respondent No. 3 and 4 flatly deny that the appointment of
            the respondent No. 5 was in any manner pre-conceived, vitiated by bias
            and the interview was a mere formality: the best candidate was selected
            by the Selection Committee based on academic records, verification of
            documents, interview performance and performance in demonstration
            class. The State-respondents through the respondent No. 2 also filed
            their affidavit and endorsed the contention of the respondent No. 3 and 4
            and submits that the members of the Selection Committee allotted marks
            within the limits of the marks permitted by the extant guidelines
            contained in the said letter dated 13-12-2011.It is pointed out by the
            answering respondent that the respondent No. 1 has already its approval
            for the appointment of the respondent No. 5 but his appointment has
            been deferred due to the interim order dated 8-8-2012 passed by this
            Court. The stance taken by the respondent No. 5 in his affidavit-in-
            opposition is no different from that of the respondent No. 3 and 4 and
            need not be referred to for the sake of brevity.
            6.      Mr. P. Mahanta, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits
            that when the petitioner actually produced the certificate of presentation
            of the paper entitled “Vo2F(dmp)2 catalyzed one step amination (?) of
            bezene and toluene with hydroxylamine” with the publication of abstract
            in support of her bio data (CV) relating to the seminar attended by her,
            the Selection Board was wrong in holding that there was no presentation
            of paper in national/international level seminar workshop and denying 2
            marks legitimately due to her on this score. According to the learned
            counsel, had 2 marks on that score been awarded to the petitioner, she
            would be getting more marks than the respondent No. 5 and, therefore,
            would be entitled to the 1st position over the respondent No. 5. According
            to the learned counsel, the respondent No. 2 in his letter dated 13-6-
WP(C) No. 4066/2012                                                                 Page 4 of 8

            2015 addressed to the standing counsel for Education (Higher)
            Department has supported the case of the petitioner by stating that he,
            after re-examination, has found that the selection committee did not
            award any mark to the petitioner regarding poster publication whereas
            some irregularities were found in the marks awarded to the respondent
            No. 5 regarding publication of research papers. He, therefore, submits
            that the selection of the respondent No. 5 is illegal and is liable to be
            quashed and in that event, the petitioner would be entitled to be selected
            for the post of Assistant Professor in Chemistry.
            7.      Per contra, Mr. N. Barua, the learned counsel for the respondent
            No. 3, strenuously defending the impugned selection, contends that the
            petitioner never submitted any certificate of presentation of paper in
            national/international     level  seminar/workshop       along    with   her
            application and her claim for 2 marks in this behalf was rightly ignored
            by the Selection Board, and once she could not get 2 mark on this score,
            other things being equal, the respondent No. 5 certainly has an edge over
            her. He maintains that such certificate was also never produced before
            the Selection Board at the time of the interview as averred by the
            respondent No. 4 in his affidavit: the respondent No. 4 himself was one of
            the members of the Selection Board. Under such circumstances, argues
            the learned counsel, there is absolutely no infirmity in the selection
            proceedings of the Selection Committee recommending the respondent
            No. 5 for the post in question. He further submits that due to the interim
            order obtained by the petitioner on grounds which turned out to be
            without merit, the respondent No. 5 has not been given the appointment,
            which calls for dismissal of the writ petition without further delay.
            8.     The pleadings of the parties have been carefully examined by me. I
            have also given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions
            made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The question to
            be considered in this writ petition is whether the petitioner is entitled to
            2 marks for presentation of paper in national/international level
            seminar/workshop. The Director of Higher Education, Assam vide his
            letter dated 13-12-2011 circulated to all Principals of Colleges of Assam
WP(C) No. 4066/2012                                                                  Page 5 of 8

            has issued fresh guidelines for marking for selection of Assistant
            Professor/Librarian as per the UGC guidelines, 2010, which is at
            Annexure-10 to the writ petition. The bone of contention here is with
            respect to distribution of marks with respect to Research Performance
            (20 marks), concerning presentation of papers in international/national
            Seminar, Workshop, etc. The total marks under this head are 5 marks
            with 2 marks each for each paper subject to maximum of 5 marks. It is
            stipulated therein that there shall be no marks only for attending
            Seminar, Workshop, etc. and that the Selection Committee may like to
            verify the Abstract volume to authenticate the presentation of paper. The
            case of the respondents is that the petitioner never submitted any
            supporting document to show that she had merely indicated in
            Annexure-1      to   her  application   that  she    had   attended   the
            symposia/seminar, but under the said UGC guidelines, no marks could
            be awarded merely for attending seminars/workshops. Nor did she
            produce any documentary evidence to demonstrate that she had actually
            made presentation of paper. A copy of the application of the petitioner
            together with the application format and Annexure-I is annexed to the
            affidavit of the respondent No. 3 and 4, which runs into 11 pages.
            9.     On perusing the aforesaid set of documents, I find that there is
            considerable force in the contention of the respondent No. 3 and 4 that
            apart from indicating that she had attended symposia/conferences in
            various places, there is nothing to indicate that she had made
            presentation of papers in such symposia/conferences. Such indications
            with supporting documents are clearly implied inasmuch as one of the
            guidelines referred to earlier clearly stipulate that there shall be no
            marks merely for attending seminar/workshop, etc. No whisper of
            statement is also made by her in her writ petition as well as her reply
            affidavit that she submitted such supporting document along with her
            application. All that she said is that she produced a certificate of
            presentation of the paper entitled “Vo2F(dmp)2 catalyzed one step
            amination (?) of benzene and toluene with hydroxylamine” with
            publication at the time of interview. This statement is, however, stoutly
            denied by the respondent No. 3 & 4 in their affidavit. In fact, the
WP(C) No. 4066/2012                                                               Page 6 of 8

            respondent No. 4 asserts at paragraph 9 of the counter that “[I]n spite of
            being member of the said Selection Committee, I have only recently come
            to know that the petitioner apparently presented a paper in a National
            Level Seminar and that too, only after perusing the copy of the writ
            petition served upon me. It is pertinent to note herein that the
            participation certificate enclosed by the petitioner with her writ petition
            (as Annexure-8 at page 28 of the petition), mentions that the occasion
            was the 12th Biennial Symposium on Modern Trends in Inorganic
            Chemistry, held at the Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of
            Technology, Madras, but is not explicit as to whether the seminar was
            national or international, or again whether it was a Poster or lecture.”
            10.   On the face of such denial by the respondent No. 3 and 4, it is not
            to hold that the petitioner had submitted any supporting document to
            show that she had made her presentation of paper along with her
            application or that she ever produced the certificate of presentation of
            the said paper. The requirement of the guidelines is that mere
            attendance in a seminar or workshop at the national or other level. If the
            petitioner claims that she made such presentation, then she has to prove
            it with a supporting document by enclosing it with her application. Mere
            statement will not do. Proof is required. This is a competitive recruitment
            process for the candidates and stipulates not only possession of the
            qualifications prescribed by the UGC guidelines but also requires a
            degree of care, alertness or absence of negligence by the candidate. The
            petitioner is expected to, and must, fill up her application and submit all
            the documents including supporting document wherever required, and if
            she is eventually disqualified for not submitting supporting documents
            which could be in her possession, she will have herself to blame. This is
            survival of the fittest. She might have been very good but there seems to
            be a candidate better than her. It is as simple as that.
            11.    At this stage, I cannot but express my disbelief in the shifting
            stand taken by the respondent No. 2 from time to time in this case. In
            his affidavit-in-opposition dated 5-2-2013, he made a statement that
            “[a]ccordingly 9 number of candidates appeared in the interview on 17-
WP(C) No. 4066/2012                                                                  Page 7 of 8

            05-2012 and the Selection Committee after following the procedure of
            law and after proper scrutiny selected one Dr.Bhupen Kumar Baruah for
            the said post on the basis of merit”. However, in his letter dated 13-6-
            2015 quoted earlier, he states that “[A]fter perusal of the documents
            forwarded by the college authority for prior approval of the proposal for
            appointment as assistant Professor the department of Chemistry in the
            said college, it appears that that there are certain irregularities in
            awarding marks to the concerned candidates who appeared in the
            interview. It appears that the selection committee did not award any
            marks to Dr. Jayashree Nath for her performance regarding poster
            publication. Similarly, the marks awarded to Dr. Bhupen Kumar Baruah,
            though there are some irregularities regarding his publication of research
            papers.” It does not behove of a responsible officer like the respondent
            No. 2 to approbate and reprobate on a matter of importance to
            candidates seeking employment in a coveted post, which is hard to come
            by these days. Had these statements been made by him in the form of
            affidavit, I would have no hesitation to take up a suo motu proceeding
            against him for perjury. However, this much is for today. In any case, in
            the view that I have taken, the case of the petitioner cannot be improved
            by the unreliable statement made by the respondent No. 2 in his said
            letter dated 13-6-2015.
            12.    The offshoot of the foregoing discussion is that there is no merit in
            this writ petition, which is hereby dismissed. The interim order stands
            vacated. There shall be no order as to cost.
