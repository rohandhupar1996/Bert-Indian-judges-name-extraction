                    THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE B.K. PATEL
          Date of Hearing : 2.4.2013     :   Date of Judgment – 25.4.2013
B.K. PATEL, J.       In this writ petition, petitioners have assailed legality of
        order dated 24.11.2012 passed by learned District Judge, Khurda at
        Bhubaneswar dismissing FAO No.111 of 2012 and confirming the
        order dated 27.8.2012 passed by learned Civil Judge (Senior
        Division), Bhubaneswar in I.A. No.391 of 2012, a proceeding for
        temporary injunction under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with
        Section 151 of the C.P.C., arising out of C.S. No.580 of 2012 by

                                    2
which parties were directed to maintain status quo over the suit
property during pendency of the suit.
2.           C.S. No.580 of 2012 is a suit for partition in respect
of the suit lands described in the schedule to the plaint under Lot
Nos.I and II. Lot No.I relates to Plot No.557 comprising of an area of
Ac.0.59   decimals    whereas   Lot   No.II relates to   Plot No.1451
comprising of an area of Ac.0.400 decimals under Khata No.161 of
Mouza Patia. At present Ac.0.200 decimals of land out of Lot No.II
has been recorded under Mutation Khata No.474/2447 in the name
of defendant no.5 and an area of Ac.0.200 decimals of land out of Lot
No.II has been recorded under Mutation Khata No.474/2021 in the
name of defendant no.4.
3.           Opposite party no.1 as the plaintiff has filed the suit
against the petitioners as defendant nos.4 and 5 respectively,
opposite party nos.2 and 3 as defendant nos.2 and 3 respectively and
defendant nos.1 and 6 claiming 1/4th share over the suit lands. The
suit lands originally belonged to and was recorded in the name of late
Chintamani who died leaving behind his widow late Sebati, two
daughters who are the plaintiff and defendant no.1, and two sons
who are defendant nos.2 and 3. On 4.2.1986 defendant no.3 and his
mother late Sebati executed registered sale deed in respect of
Ac.0.200 decimals of land out of Lot No.II in favour of defendant no.6
and thereafter on 17.2.1997 defendant no.6 executed registered sale

                                     3
deed in respect of the said land in favour of defendant no.5.
Defendant no.2 was a signatory to the registered            sale    deed
dated 4.2.1986 as a witness. Defendant no.5           got    the    land
purchased by her mutated in her name under Khata No.474/2447 in
Mutation Case No.5249/ 2003. Also she has got the status of the
land purchased by her converted to the status of „Gharabari‟ in OLR
Case No.5674/2007. It is also not disputed that on 7.3.2001
defendant no.2 executed registered sale deed in respect of balance
Ac.0.200 decimals of land out of Lot No.II in favour of defendant
no.4. Defendant no.3 was a signatory to the sale deed as a
consenting party. After purchase, defendant no.4 has got the land
purchased by him mutated in his name under Khata No.474/2021 in
Mutation Case No.1644/2001 and has got the status of the land
purchased by him converted to the status of „Gharabari‟ in OLR Case
No.532/2008. These facts are not in dispute.
4.           Plaintiff‟s case is that on 19.3.2012, when she was in
peaceful possession over the suit lands, defendant no.4 threatened
her of dispossession on the strength of registered sale deed executed
and mutation of the case land made in his favour. Thereafter only the
plaintiff could learn regarding alienation of the suit lands under Lot
No.II by her co-sharers under the above said registered sale deeds.
Plaintiff   has   assailed    the  sale  deeds    as    wrong,   illegal,
misrepresentation of fact, nullity, void and not binding on the
plaintiff in any manner. It is asserted by her that there being no

                                      4
partition of the joint family property left behind by late Chintamani,
she is entitled to 1/4th share out of the suit lands under Lot Nos.I
and II.
5.           In her application under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 read
with Section 151 of the C.P.C. for temporary injunction, presented
along with the plaint, plaintiff, in the backdrop of her claim to be a
co-sharer in respect of the joint family property, alleged that not only
defendant no.4 threatened her of dispossession from the suit
property over which she is in peaceful possession but also defendant
no.4 stacked raw materials to construct permanent structure. Also
she could come to learn that defendant nos.2 and 3 were negotiating
with outsiders to alienate land under Lot No.I. Under these
assertions, prayer was made for grant of injunction against
defendant nos.2 to 5 to restrain from alienating as well as from
making construction of permanent structure over the suit land.
6.           Defendant no.3 did not file any objection in the
proceeding for temporary injunction.
7.           Defendant nos.4 and 5 filed joint objection resisting the
claim of temporary injunction.      It is pleaded that after death of late
Cintamani there was division in the family in course of which plaintiff
and defendant no.1 took money value of their share of the joint
property and specifically agreed not to claim any share by executing
agreement dated 21.9.1999.         As per amicable partition, eastern
portion of the land under Lot No.II was allotted to defendant no.2 and

                                    5
western portion was allotted to defendant no.3.        Defendant no.3
along with his mother late Sebati, for legal necessity,     sold    his
share under Lot No.II to defendant no.6 for consideration      through
registered sale deed dated 3.2.1986 with the consent of defendant
no.2 and delivered possession of the land to the vendee. Defendant
no.6 while in exclusive peaceful possession over his purchased land
sold the same to defendant no.5 by registered sale deed dated
17.2.1997 for a consideration and delivered possession thereof.    It is
further pleaded that similarly defendant no.2 by registered sale deed
dated 7.3.2001 sold his share out of the land under Lot No.II to
defendant no.4 for     consideration and delivered possession thereof
with the consent of defendant no.3. Defendant nos. 4 and 5 claim to
be in possession over the lands purchased by them.           It is also
pleaded that defendant no.5 has executed registered General Power
of Attorney dated 24.2.2010 in respect of her purchased land in
favour of M/s Uprise Constructions Pvt. Ltd. for construction of a
residential multistoried complex in the name and style of „SOURYA‟.
Accordingly    after  completion   of  construction   work   individual
apartments have been transferred to different purchasers who are in
peaceful possession of their respective purchased area.        Plaintiff
having not impleaded said purchasers in the suit for partition, the
suit is liable to be dismissed. Claim of plaintiff to be in possession
over the suit land is stoutly denied by these defendants.

                                    6
8.           Defendant no.2 in his objection has supported the case
of defendant nos.4 and 5 and plead that late Chintamani, during
his life time got his daughters, the plaintiff and      defendant    no.1,
married by taking assistance from defendant no.2. After death of late
Chintamani, the plaintiff and defendant no.1 voluntarily executed
deed of relinquishment dated 21.9.1999 in the form of agreement in
respect of the suit property. Consequently, defendant nos.2 and 3
became absolute owners of the suit lands. There was partition
between defendant nos.2 and 3 on 15.2.2002 and they have disposed
of the lands which fell to their shares to different persons and also
gave delivery of possession of lands sold by them.      Possession of the
plaintiff has also been denied.
9.           It was contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioners that in passing the blanket order directing the parties to
maintain status quo over the entire suit lands, including the lands
under Lot No.II also, both the courts below utterly failed to appreciate
the facts of the case as well as the legal ramification thereof. In
arriving at their conclusion that the plaintiff has established
existence of all the three ingredients, i.e., prima facie case, balance of
convenience and irreparable loss, to be entitled to an order of
temporary injunction, both the courts below have relied solely on
1973 Settlement ROR in which entire suit lands stood recorded in
the name of late Chintamani.        However, it is not disputed that
subsequently the suit lands under Lot No.II have been mutated and

                                    7
recorded in the names of defendant nos.4 and 5.           Execution   of
sale deeds by defendant no.3 and late Sebati            in   favour   of
defendant no.6, by defendant no.6 in favour of defendant no.5 and
by defendant no.2 in favour of defendant no.4 is not disputed. That
apart, defendant nos.4 and 5 got the kissam of lands under Lot No.II
converted to „Gharabari‟ in OLR proceedings. Neither of the court
below has taken note of all these transactions which remain
undisputed. Presumptive value of possession, if any, arising out of
the entries in the 1973 Settlement ROR in favour of all the legal heirs
of late Chintamani stands rebutted by the entries made in the
subsequent mutation records of right. That apart, it is also pertinent
to note that the plaintiff has not made any prayer in the suit for
setting aside any of the sale deeds. Placing reliance on the decision of
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Kishorsinh Ratansinh Jadeja –vrs.-
Maruti Corp. & Ors. : 2010 (I) CLR (SC) 305, it was also contended
that apart from prima facie case, balance of convenience            and
irreparable loss, in considering the application for temporary
injunction under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 of the C.P.C. the Court is
required to consider also the conduct of the parties prior to
institution of the suit. In the present case, the suit lands under Lot
No.II were sold by the co-sharers of the plaintiff way back on
17.2.1997 and 7.3.2001.       In the meanwhile, by virtue of General
Power of Attorney dated 24.2.2010 executed by defendant no.5 not
only multistoried complex has been constructed by third party

                                      8
builder    but    also  apartments    constructed   thereon  have   been
transferred to different purchasers who are in possession. Plaintiff
claimed that each of the legal heirs of late Chintamani is entitled
to 1/4th share only out of the entire suit properties. Admittedly,
neither defendant no.2 nor defendant no.3 has sold more than the
extent of his share over the suit lands. Rather, Lot No.I comprises of
an area of Ac.0.59 decimals which is more than the extent of share
which the plaintiff and her sister defendant no.1 may be entitled to.
In such circumstances, the impugned order of restraint so far as it
relates to the lands under Lot No.II is not sustainable in law.
6.             In reply learned counsel for the contesting opposite party
no.1 supported and defended the impugned orders. It was contended
that admittedly the entire suit lands belong to late Chintamani. There
has been no partition of the suit lands between the plaintiff and her
co-sharers. None of the co-sharers is entitled to transfer the joint
property even to the extent of his/her undivided interested therein.
In such circumstances, the court below rightly directed the parties to
maintain status quo over the suit property until adjudication of
plaintiff‟s claim of purchase.
7.             It has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for
the petitioners that both the courts below have referred only to the
fact of recording of the suit lands in the name late Chintamani as the
basis for coming to the conclusion that the plaintiff has established

                                    9
existence of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable
loss in her favour.  Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant nos.1,2
and 3 dispute execution of sale deeds by defendant no.3 and his
late mother with the consent of the defendant no.2 in favour of
defendant no.6, by defendant no.6 in favour of defendant no.5 and
defendant no.2 with the consent of defendant no.3 in favour of
defendant no.4 so far as suit schedule Lot No.II lands are concerned.
After purchase of lands mutation Records-of-Right have been issued
in favour of defendants 4 and 5 and also defendants 4 and 5 have got
kissam of lands under Lot No.II converted to homestead. Orders in
the mutation cases as well as conversion proceedings under the
Orissa Land Reforms Act have to be presumed to have passed after
due enquiry.     Mutation Records-of-Right in favour of defendants 4
and 5 having been issued much later than publication of 1973
Settlement R.O.R., entries in mutation Records-of-Right have more
presumptive value than the entries in the earlier Record-of-Right. In
such circumstances, plaintiff could not have been held to have
satisfied regarding existence of a prima facie case in her favour on the
basis of entries in 1973 Settlement R.O.R. only. That apart, not only
the defendants 4 and 5 but also plaintiff‟s co-sharer defendant no.2
have pleaded that there was partition of the joint family property.
Specific case of defendant no.2 is that plaintiff and defendant no.1
voluntarily executed relinquishment deed dated 21.9.1999 in respect
of the entire suit lands in favour of their brothers. Plaintiff has not

                                     10
prayed for relief of declaration that the three sale deeds on the basis
of which defendants 4 and 5 claim title and possession       are    void
documents. There is no prayer in the suit to set aside the sale
deeds. Moreover, plaintiff does not dispute entitlements of each of
defendants 2 and 3 to 1/4th share out of the entire suit lands and the
extent of lands out of Lot No.II by each of defendant nos. 2 and 3
does not exceed the latent of his share.         It is well settled that
transfer by one of the co-owners remains valid to the extent of the
share of the transferor. The co-owner can transfer his undivided
interest in a joint property and the transferee acquires right to
enforce the sale.    Reference in this connection may be made to the
decisions in Gourhari Das –vs- Kalpataru Das and others : 34
(1992) OJD 137; Hardeo Rai –vs- Sankutala Devi and others:
(2008) 7 SCC 46; Smt. Bina Sukla –vs- Smt. Meena Devi Panch
and others: 106(2008) CLT 330 and Harekrushna Mahakud –vs-
Rathanath Mahakud & Ors: 2009(1) CLR 560.
8.           The three sale deeds on the basis of which defendants 4
and 5 claim title and possession over Lot No.II property were
executed on 4.2.1986, 17.2.1997 and 7.3.2001. In the meanwhile,
multi-storied building is asserted to have been constructed on a part
thereof. It is also asserted that apartments of the building have been
sold to a number of persons who are in possession. Plaintiff has all
along remained silent till filing of the present suit in the year 2012.
Therefore the conduct of the plaintiff also comes on the way of

                                       11
granting equitable relief of temporary injunction in her favour.          In
Kishorsinh       Ratansinh      Jadeja     –vrs.- Maruti        Corp.      &
Ors.(supra)    the   Supreme     Court    having point out that Court is
required to consider principles of prima facie case, balance of
convenience and inconvenience, and irreparable loss and injury in
passing interim order of injunction, further held that the Court is
required to consider also conduct of the party. It was held as follows:
       “the question of conduct of the Respondent No.1 also becomes
       relevant, inasmuch as, having slept over its rights for more than
       19 years, it will be inequitable on its prayer to restrain the
       owners of the property from dealing with the same, having
       particular regard to the fact that a large portion of the land has
       already been conveyed to as many as 280 purchasers who are in
       the process of erecting constructions thereupon.”
9.            Thus, in view of sale transactions made long back and
entries made in the Records-of-Right on the basis of such
transactions in mutation and OLR conversion proceedings, it cannot
be held that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case to be
entitled to grant of temporary injunction in respect of lands under
suit schedule Lot No.II.       The entries in the Records-of-Right and
construction     of  multistoried     building   have    tilted  balance  of
convenience in favour of defendants 4 and 5. Any interference with
such balance shall certainly result inconvenience and irreparable
loss to the defendants 4 and 5. Therefore, the impugned order so far
as it relates to lands under suit schedule Lot No.II is concerned, is
not sustainable.

                                    12
10.            Accordingly, the order passed by the both the courts
below so far as it relates to maintenance of status  quo   over the
lands under suit schedule Lot No.II is concerned, is set aside.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
