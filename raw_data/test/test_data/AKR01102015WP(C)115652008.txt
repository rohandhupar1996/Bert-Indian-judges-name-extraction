                        THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K. RATH
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of Hearing: 01.10.2015 │ Date of Judgment: 01.10.2015
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         Aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated
      2.8.2008 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Jr. Divn.), 1st Court,
      Cuttack in C.S. No.213 of 2003, the instant petition is filed under
      Article 227 of the Constitution of India. By the said order, learned
      trial court rejected the application of the plaintiff filed under Order
      26    Rule  9   C.P.C.   to   depute    a   survey   knowing    civil  court
      commissioner.

                                    2
02.            The petitioner as plaintiff filed a suit for perpetual
injunction     restraining  the   defendant-opposite    parties   from
interfering with the peaceful possession of the suit land or making
any construction over the same in the court of the learned Civil
Judge (Jr. Divn.), 1st Court, Cuttack, which is registered as C.S.
No.213 of 2003. Pursuant to issuance of summons, the defendants
entered appearance and filed their written statement denying the
assertions made in the plaint. While the matter stood thus, an
application was filed by the plaintiff under Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. for
deputing a civil court commissioner to resolve the dispute. Learned
trial court allowed the same and accordingly deputed a survey
knowing civil court commissioner to measure the land and submit a
report. The commissioner submitted the report on 12.3.2008. The
plaintiff filed objection to the same. By order dated 15.7.2008,
learned trial court rejected the report of the commissioner.
Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application on 21.7.2008 for
deputing a fresh survey knowing civil court commissioner vide
Annexure-3. The defendants filed objection to the same, vide
Annexure-4. By order dated 2.8.2008, learned trial court rejected
the petition vide Annexure-5. The operative part of the impugned
order is quoted hereunder.

                                     3
                    “xxx              xxx                 xxx
            …………Then in such circumstances, after closer of
            evidence from both the sides and without
            considering the actual factum of dispute among the
            parties in the suit regarding the actual existence of
            the suit boundary wall at the spot on consideration of
            the evidence already adduced on record, a party like
            the plaintiff cannot be assisted by this court to
            collect any evidence in it’s favour by allowing the
            present petition and therefore in consideration of all
            such discussed facts, this court is of the humble view
            that at this stage the present petition filed by the
            plaintiff merits no consideration, when the suit
            posted for hearing argument from both the sides and
            therefore the same is liable to be rejected at this
            stage with further observation that, if the court
            would arrive at a conclusion that neither parties has
            been able to produce evidence to that effect, then
            the same can be considered thereof by the court
            only.
                    xxx              xxx                  xxx”
03.          Heard learned counsel for the parties.
04.         Learned trial court came to hold that when the suit was
posted for argument, the petition was filed for deputing a survey
knowing civil court commissioner. It was further held that both the
parties have adduced evidence in support of their respective claims.
The court should not assist the parties to collect the evidence on its
behalf. The earlier report of the civil court commissioner was
ignored. Thus after closure of evidence and without considering that
factum of dispute and existence of boundary wall, the court cannot
assist the party to collect evidence.

                                   4
05.       Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. is quoted hereunder.
          “9. Commissions to make local investigations—
          In any suit in which the Court deems a local
          investigation to be requisite or proper for the
          purpose of elucidating any matter in dispute, or of
          ascertaining the market-value of any property, or
          the amount of any mesne profits or damages or
          annual net profits, the Court may issue a commission
          to such person as it thinks fit directing him to make
          such investigation and to report thereon to the Court
          :
                 Provided that, where the State Government
          has made rules as to the persons to whom such
          commission shall be issued, the Court shall be bound
          by such rules.”
06.       In Bhabesh Kumar Das v. Mohan Das Agrawal, 2015
(II) CLR 603, this Court held as under:
          “In the case of Prasanta Kumar Jena Vrs.
          Choudhury Purna Ch. Das Adhikari, 99 (2005)
          CLT 720, the learned Single Judge of this Court held
          that an application under Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. can
          be considered only after closure of the evidence
          when the court finds difficult to pass an effective
          decree on the existing evidence. Relying on the said
          decision, learned Single Judge of this Court set aside
          the order of appointment of Survey Knowing
          Commissioner for measurement and demarcation of
          the land passed by the learned trial court. The same
          was challenged before this Court in the case of Ram
          Prasad Mishra Vrs. Dinabandhu Patri and
          another. The Bench speaking through Mr.V.Gopala
          Gowda, C.J.(as he then was) held that the learned
          Single Judge has interfered with the order passed by
          the learned trial court in appointing the Survey
          Knowing Commissioner ignoring the decision of this
          Court in the case of Mahendranath Parida Vrs.
          Purnananda Pardia and others, AIR 1988 ORISSA
          248. Thus, the decision in the case of Prasanta
          Kumar Jena (supra) has been impliedly overruled by
          the Division Bench of this Court.
                 In Mahendranath Parida (supra), this Court
          held that when the controversy is as to identification,

                                       5
             location or measurement of the land or premise or
             object, local investigation should be done at an early
             stage so that the parties can be aware of the report
             of the Commissioner and can go to trial prepared.
                    In Ramakant Naik and others Vrs. Bhanja
             Dalabehera, 2015 AIR CC 1724 (ORI), this Court
             held that issuance of a Commission for local
             investigation is the discretion of the Court. While
             considering     the   prayer   for   appointment    of
             Commission, the Court must apply its mind to the
             facts and circumstances of the case and pass order.
             No straight jacket formula can be laid down. Before
             issuance of Commission, the Court must be satisfied
             that there is prima facie case in favour of the
             applicant.
                    On a reading of Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C., it is
             manifest that the stage of appointment of Survey
             Knowing Commissioner has not been prescribed.
             When the legislature in its wisdom has not
             prescribed the stage of appointment of Survey
             Knowing Commissioner, the power of the Court to
             appoint the Survey Knowing Commissioner can not
             be cabined, cribbed or confined.”
07.          On a conspectus of the plaint, it is evident that the
dispute pertains to boundary wall. The application was filed by the
plaintiff to depute a civil court commissioner to find out the
existence of the boundary wall. The earlier application filed by the
plaintiff for deputing a survey knowing civil court commissioner
under Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. was allowed by the learned trial court.
The commissioner submitted its report. Since both the parties
objected to the same, learned trial court rejected the report.
08.          As has been held by this Court in Bhabesh Kumar Das
cited supra, when the legislature in its wisdom has not prescribed
the stage of appointment of survey knowing commissioner, the

                                              6
power of the Court cannot be cabined, cribbed or confined. The
survey knowing commissioner at any stage of the suit provided the
pre-conditions enumerated in Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. exists.
09.                    In view of the same, this Court has no hesitation to
quash the order dated 2.8.2008 passed by the learned Civil Judge
(Jr. Divn.), 1st Court, Cuttack in C.S. No.213 of 2003. Accordingly,
the said order is quashed. The application filed by the plaintiff under
Order 26 Rule 9 C.P.C. is allowed. Learned trial court shall do well to
appoint a survey knowing civil court commissioner within a period of
fifteen days after receipt of the order. Since the evidence is closed,
learned trial court shall do well to deliver the judgment after receipt
of the report of the commissioner.
                       The petition is allowed.
                                                  ……………………………….
