                                     P.K.Routray & R. Rout.
               For opp. party   :   Sk.Zaffrulah, Addl. Standing Counsel
       PRESENT:
                   THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI
             Date of hearing: 26.07.2013 |     Date of Judgment: 02.08.2013
Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.      The order dated 24.12.1993 passed by the learned
       J.M.F.C., Soro in G.R. Case No. 300 of 1992 taking cognizance of the
       offences under Section 498-A and Section 4 of D.P. Act in Annexure-2, is
       sought to be quashed in the present CRLMC.
       2.               The prosecution case, in short, is that in 1985 the daughter
       of the informant had married to accused Umesh Ch. Das. At the time of
       marriage the informant had given a cash of Rs.5,000/-, 8 tolas of gold etc.,
       but could not comply with the demand of one Godrej Almirah, for which his
       daughter was subjected to ill-treatment by the petitioners, who are her in

                                        2
laws. On 30.05.1992 the informant had gone to his daughter’s house on
the occasion of “Sabitri   Amabasya”     where he learnt that his daughter
along with her baby aged about seven months have died. Later he came to
know from the neighbours of the accused persons that they killed his
daughter and the baby by pouring petrol. So, the informant reported the
matter at Soro Police Station. Police conducted investigation and after
completion of the same, submitted charge-sheet against the petitioners
and one Umesh Ch. Das, the husband of the deceased under Section 498-
A/304-B of I.P.C. and Section 4 of D.P. Act. On receipt of the charge-sheet,
the learned J.M.F.C., Soro took cognizance of the offence under Sections
498-A/304-B/34 of I.P.C. and Section 4 of D.P. Act. against the petitioners
and the said Umesh Ch. Das by order dated 24.12.1993 in G.R. Case
No.300 of 1992.
3.              Challenging the said order of cognizance Umesh Ch. Das,
the husband of the deceased filed a criminal revision before the learned
Sessions Judge, Balasore, who on analysis of materials available on record,
by order dated 11.07.1995 set-aside the order of cognizance so far as it
relates to Section 304-B of I.P.C. However, he confirmed the order of
cognizance as regards cognizance under Section 498-A of I.P.C. and
Section 4 of D.P. Act. The trial against the petitioners and Umesh Ch. Das
was split up by the learned J.M.F.C., Soro vide order dated 29.04.99.
Accordingly, learned J.M.F.C. framed charges against Umesh Ch. Das under
Section 498A of I.P.C. and Section 4 of D.P. Act. After charges were
framed, the learned Magistrate proceeded with the trial. In the trial since
the prosecution miserably failed to bring home the charges levelled against

                                        3
Umesh Ch. Das acquitted him of the charges vide judgment dated
04.12.2001 endorsing the case as a mistake of fact. The main contention of
the petitioners, who are the in laws is that because of the acquittal of
Umesh Ch. Das, the husband of the deceased, who is alleged to be the
main accused by revisional order clearly indicative/suggestive to make it
evident that there is absolutely no material to make out an offence under
Section 498-A/304-B of I.P.C. and Section 4 of D.P. Act against them.
Therefore, the petitioners seek for quashing of criminal proceeding against
them.
4.               Mr. D.P. Dhal, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner
To substantiate this contention relied upon the judgments reported in
Namita Nayak @ Namita Kumari Nayak & another Vrs. State of
Orissa: (2007) 37 OCR 150, Aditya Kumar Rath Vrs. State of Orissa:
(2008) 41 OCR 233, Chirantan Sahu Vrs. State of Orissa: (2011) 48
OCR 289 & Surendra Kumar @ Surendra Routray Vrs. State of
Orissa: 2011 (I) OLR 1052 and vehemently urged that since the main
accused has already been acquitted by following trial, no useful purpose
will be served to continue with the proceeding in respect of the petitioners
as it will amount to abuse of the process of Court.
5.               Before going into the merits of the case, the law governing
the field is to be examined. In Central Bureau of Investigation Vrs.
Akhilesh Singh reported in AIR 2005 SC 268=2005 (I) OLR SC
354=(2005) 30 OCR (SC) 201 the Supreme Court has held that when the
main accused has already been acquitted of the trial the continuation of the
criminal proceedings against the other accused would be an abuse of the

                                        4
process of law, especially when there is bleak possibility of their conviction.
In Kanhu Behera Vrs. State of Orissa, 2005(II) OLR 386 it has been
held that quashing of cognizance is an inherent power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. and can be invoked to quash the order of cognizance involving non-
compoundable offences where the principal accused has already been
acquitted after a full-fledged trial and continuance of the criminal
proceeding against the petitioners would be undoubtedly abuse of the
process of Court. In Santosh Kumar Maity Vrs. State of Orissa, (2006)
35 OCR 151, Aditya Kumar Rath Vrs. State of Orissa, (2008) 41 OCR
233, Chirantan Sahu Vrs. State of Orissa: (2011) 48 OCR 289 the
proceeding against the petitioner who has been shown as absconder in the
charge sheet was quashed since the son had faced trial and had been
acquitted and therefore, it was held that no purpose exists for continuance
of trial. Similar view has also been taken in Upendra Sahoo @ Upenda
Kumar Sahoo v. State of Orissa, (2006) 35 OCR 171 in which this Court
has quashed the criminal proceeding. Further, in Madhavrao Jiwajirao
Scindia and others v. Sambajirao Chandrojirao Angre and others,
AIR 1988 SC 709, the apex Court has held that where in the opinion of the
Court, the chance of ultimate conviction is bleak and no useful purpose is
likely to be served by allowing the criminal proceeding to continue, the
Court may while taking into consideration of the special facts of the case
also quash the proceeding.
6.                The judgment in Surendra Kumar @ Surendra Routray
(supra),    the fact of which case is akin to the case in hand, where the
offence alleged to have been committed is one under Sections 498-A/304-

                                        5
B/306/34 IPC and 4 of the D.P. Act against all the accused persons
including the in laws and husband     of the deceased Nandini. Against the
husband, Narendra the case was split up and S.T. case No. 46 of 2007
continued. Since he was acquitted by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge,
Jajpur on 28.03.2008, in that case in laws were before this Court and on
considering the facts and circumstances of that case, this Court held that
when the main accused has already been acquitted in the trial, continuance
of the criminal proceedings against the in-laws, would be an abuse of the
process of law especially when there is bleak possibility of any conviction.
7.              Considering the aforesaid judgments relied upon by the
learned counsel for the petitioners and the law laid down by the apex
Court, I am of the considered view that the continuance of the criminal
proceeding against the present petitioners, who are the in-laws of the
deceased, would be an abuse of the process of law, especially when there
is bleak possibility of any conviction and, therefore, the ends of justice
would be best served if the proceeding in the split up trial is quashed.
Accordingly, the proceeding in G.R. Case No.300 of 1992 pending in the
court of learned J.M.F.C., Soro is hereby quashed. The CRLMC is
accordingly allowed.
