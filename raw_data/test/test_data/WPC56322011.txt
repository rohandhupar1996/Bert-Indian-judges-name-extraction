                            For the respondents …        Mr. NC Das, SC,
                                                         Dibrugarh University
                                Date of Hearing    ...   04-08-2015
                                Date of Judgment ...     25-08-2015
                                     JUDGMENT & ORDER
                    The sole question which falls for consideration in this writ petition
            is whether, on the facts and circumstances of this case, the University-
            respondents are barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from
            withholding the result of the B.A. Part-II Examination of the petitioner held
            in 1999?
            2.     The facts giving rise to this writ petition are that the petitioner
            passed the B.A. Part-I Examination in the year 1995 and appeared in the
            B.A. Part-II Examination in the year 1996, but was debarred from the
            examination Hall and was expelled from the examination for two years on
            the instruction of the College authorities. In the year 1999, she filled up
            the application form for the B.A. Part-II Examination by paying the
            requisite examination fees. The University-respondents issued the Admit
            Card for the Examination whereafter the petitioner duly sat for the
            Examination and waited for her result. However, the College authority
            informed her that her result was withheld. This induced her to approach
            this Court in WP(C) No. 273/2011 with the prayer for directing the
            University-respondents to either disclose the reason for withholding her
            result or declare the result forthwith. This Court by the order dated 21-1-
            2011 disposed of the writ petition by directing the Controller of
            Examination of the University-respondents to dispose of the representation
            dated 3-7-2010 within three months. The University-respondents by the
            letter dated 10-2-2011 addressed to the Advocate of the petitioner
            disposed   of   her  representation,  the   relevant  portion  whereof    are
            reproduced below:
                      “Sir,
WP(C) No. 5632/11                                                                   Page 2 of 11

                              With reference to the Case No. WP(C) 273/2011 in
                       respect of the Jayanti Sarkar of Lakhimpur Girls’ College, I
                       am to inform that is a registered student of this University
                       of 1992-1993 so he had to appear B.A Part-I examination in
                       1994, but she cleared Part-I examination in 1995 in her
                       second attempt. Accordingly she had to clear her Part-II
                       examination in three consecutive chanches i.e. in 1998. But
                       she appeared Part-II examination only in 1999 which is
                       overchance.”
            3.      Obviously, the petitioner had missed her chance to pass Part-II
            examination within the period permitted by the statute governing the field
            for clearing the same i.e. by 1998. There is no dispute on this issue.
            However, the contention of Mr. M.A. Sheikh, the learned counsel for the
            petitioner, is that the University-respondents, having duly issued the
            Admit Card to the petitioner for the examination and having allowed her to
            sit in the examination, for which she had not played fraud, are now barred
            by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from withholding her result, and it
            would be most inequituous to do so in this manner. To fortify his
            submission, the learned counsel takes me to the decision of the Apex
            Court in Shri Krishnan v. The Kurukshetra University, AIR 1976 SC
            376 and the decision of this Court in Archana Goswami v. State of
            Assam, 1998 (1) GLT 188. Per contra, Mr. R. Mazumdar, the learned
            standing counsel for the University-respondents, submits that the decision
            of the University-respondents to withhold the result of her examination is
            based on the statutes, which barred the petitioner from appearing in the
            B.A. Part-II examination after 1998, and the law is now well-settled that
            there can be no estoppel against the statute. He contends that the
            petitioner cannot take advantage of the issuance of the Admit Card to her
            for claiming declaration of her result: she completely overlooks the fact
            that the Admit Card issued to her was a provisional Admit Card enabling
            the University-respondents to cancel the examination subsequently if any
            defects were found in her candidature. He relies on the decision of the
            Apex Court in Maharashi Dayanand University v. Surjeet Kaur, (2010)
            11 SCC 159 to buttress his contentions. He, therefore, maintains that the
            writ petition has no merit and is liable to be dismissed with costs:
WP(C) No. 5632/11                                                                Page 3 of 11

                      “6. Mr Sibal, learned Counsel for the appellant submitted two
                  points before us. In the first place it was argued that once the
                  appellant was allowed to appear at LL.B. Part II examination
                  held on May 19, 1973 his candidature could not be withdrawn
                  for any reason whatsoever in view of the mandatory provisions of
                  clause 2(b) of the Kurukshetra University Calendar, Vol. I,
                  Ordinance 10 under which the candidature could be withdrawn
                  before the candidate took the examination. Secondly it was
                  argued that the order of the university was mala fide because the
                  real reason for cancelling the candidature of the appellant was
                  the insistence of the District Education Officer that the appellant
                  should not have been admitted to the Law Faculty unless he had
                  obtained the permission of his superior officers. In order to
                  appreciate the first contention it may be necessary to extract the
                  relevant portions of the statute contained in Kurukshetra
                  University Calendar, Volume I, Ordinance 10. Clause 2 of this
                  ordinance runs as follows:
                      “2. The following certificates, signed by the Principal of the
                  College/Head of the Department concerned, shall be required
                  from each applicant:—
                      (a) that the candidate has satisfied him by the production of
                  the certificate of a competent authority that he has passed the
                  examinations     which    qualified him   for  admission    to   the
                  examination; and
                      (b) that he has attended a regular course of study for the
                  prescribed number of academic years.
                      Certificate (b) will be provisional and can be withdrawn at
                  any time before the examination if the applicant fails to attend
                  the prescribed course of lectures before the end of his term.”
                  The last part of this statute clearly shows that the university
                  could withdraw the certificate if the applicant had failed to
                  attend the prescribed course of lectures. But this could be done
                  only before the examination. It is, therefore, manifest that once
                  the appellant was allowed to take the examination, rightly or
                  wrongly, then the statute which empowers the university to
WP(C) No. 5632/11                                                                Page 4 of 11

                  withdraw the candidature of the applicant has worked itself out
                  and the applicant cannot be refused admission subsequently for
                  any infirmity which should have been looked into before giving
                  the applicant permission to appear. It was, however, submitted
                  by Mr Nandy, learned Counsel for the respondent that the
                  names of the candidates who were short of percentage were
                  displayed on the notice board of the college and the appellant
                  was fully aware of the same and yet he did not draw the
                  attention of the university authorities when he applied for
                  admission to appear in LL.B. Part II examination. Thus the
                  appellant was guilty of committing serious fraud and was not
                  entitled to any indulgence from this Court.
                      7. It appears from the averments made in the counter-
                  affidavit that according to the procedure prevalent in the college
                  the admission forms are forwarded by the Head of the
                  Department      in   December     preceding  the   year when     the
                  examination is held. In the instant case the admission form of
                  the appellant must have been forwarded in December 1971
                  whereas the examination was to take place in Apri1/May 1972.
                  It is obvious that during this period of four to five months it was
                  the duty of the university authorities to scrutinise the form in
                  order to find out whether it was in order. Equally it was the duty
                  of the Head of the Department of Law before submitting the form
                  to the university to see that the form complied with all the
                  requirements of law. If neither the Head of the Department nor
                  the university authorities took care to scrutinise the admission
                  form, then the question of the appellant committing a fraud did
                  not arise. It is well settled that where a person on whom fraud is
                  committed is in a position to discover the truth by due diligence,
                  fraud is not proved. It was neither a case of suggestio falsi, or
                  suppressio veri. The appellant never wrote to the university
                  authorities that he had attended the prescribed number of
                  lectures. There was ample time and opportunity for the
                  university authorities to have found out the defect. In these
                  circumstances, therefore, if the university authorities acquiesced
                  in the infirmities which the admission form contained and
WP(C) No. 5632/11                                                                Page 5 of 11

                        allowed the appellant to appear in Part I examination in April
                        1972, then by force of the university statute the university had
                        no power to withdraw the candidature of the appellant. A
                        somewhat similar situation arose in Premji Bhai Ganesh Bhai
                        Kshatriya v. Vice Chancellor, Ravishankar University,
                        Raipur 1 where a Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya
                        Pradesh observed as follows:
                            “From the provisions of Ordinance Nos. 19 and 48 it is clear
                        that the scrutiny as to the requisite attendance of the candidates
                        is required to be made before the admission cards are issued.
                        Once the admission cards are issued permitting the candidates
                        to take their examination, there is no provision in Ordinance 19
                        or Ordinance 48 which would enable the Vice Chancellor to
                        withdraw the permission. The discretion having been clearly
                        exercised in favour of the petitioner by permitting him to appear
                        at the examination, it was not open to the Vice Chancellor to
                        withdraw that permission subsequently and to withhold his
                        result.”
                                                               (Underlined for emphasis)
                4.      I have to reproduce the above extracts at length so that the ratio
                therein could be understood and culled out. The basic contentions of
                the learned standing counsel for the University advanced now in the
                instant case were also evidently argued by Mr. Kapil Sibal, the learned
                counsel for the appellant before the Apex Court in Shri Hrishan case
                (supra). It seems to me that the argument by the learned counsel
                therein that the Admit Card issued therein was only provisional and
                could, therefore, be cancelled/withdrawn once it was detected that the
                candidature of the appellant was found to be defective for any reason
                did not appeal to the Apex Court. According to the Apex Court, such
                cancellation/withdrawal could be done only before the examination and
                not after the examination. The Apex Court further held that once the
                appellant was allowed to sit in the examination, rightly or wrongly, then
                the statute which empowers the University to withdraw the candidature
                of the appellant therein had worked itself out and the appellant could

                   not be refused the admission subsequently for any infirmity which
                   should have been looked into before giving the appellant permission to
                   appear. No fraud was played by the petitioner therein upon the
                   University. According to the Apex Court, there was time and
                   opportunity for the University authorities to have found out the defect.
                   Under that circumstances, held the Apex Court, the respondent
                   authorities had acquiesced in the infirmities which the admission form
                   contained and allowed the appellant to appear in Part-I Examination in
                   April, 1972, then by the force of the University Statute, the University
                   had no power to withdraw the candidature of the appellant. The
                   learned standing counsel for the University, however, submits that the
                   latest decision of the Apex Court in Surjeet Kaur case (supra) has
                   conclusively and finally settled the issue in favour of the University
                   when it held that mistake on the part of the authorities does not confer
                   any right to make a claim against the statute as there can be no
                   estoppel against statute inasmuch as this decision is latter in point of
                   time. In order to appreciate this contention of the learned standing
                   counsel for the University, I may also extensively quote the decision of
                   the Apex Court in Surjeet Kaur case (supra) as under:
                           “11. It is settled legal proposition that neither the court nor any
                       tribunal has the competence to issue a direction contrary to law and
                       to act in contravention of a statutory provision. The Court has no
                       competence to issue a direction contrary to law nor the court can
                       direct an authority to act in contravention of the statutory
                       provisions.
                           12. In State of Punjab v. Renuka Singla 2, dealing with a
                       similar situation, this Court observed as under: (SCC p. 178, para
                       8)
                           “8. … We fail to appreciate as to how the High Court or this
                       Court can be generous or liberal in issuing such directions which in
                       substance amount to directing the authorities concerned to violate
                       their own statutory rules and regulations….”
                           13. Similarly, in Karnataka SRTC v. Ashrafulla Khan 3, this
                       Court held as under: (SCC pp. 572-73, para 27)
2
  (1994) 1 SCC 175
WP(C) No. 5632/11                                                                         Page 7 of 11

                               “27. … The High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is
                           required to enforce rule of law and not pass order or direction which
                           is contrary to what has been injuncted by law.”
                           Similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Manish Goel v.
                           Rohini Goel 4.
                               14. It is worth noting that the respondent at the time of filling up
                           of her form for BEd course at the first instance had not made any
                           disclosure about her pursuit of postgraduate student (sic studies) in
                           Political Science.
                               15. The Notification dated 16-3-1998 read as under:
                               “It is notified that the University has granted last mercy chance
                           to the candidates of undergraduate (under pattern 10+2+3) as well
                           as       postgraduate             examination(s) (annual system     after
                           discontinuation of semester system) except MBBS/BDS/MD/PG
                           diploma courses, who could not clear their reappear paper(s) within
                           stipulated chances and have been declared as fail and those who
                           could not pass/complete the degree within the stipulated period e.g.
                           within six years of undergraduate and four years for postgraduate
                           courses, as per the latest syllabi. The examination fee will be Rs.
                           1000.”
                               16. A bare perusal of the same would demonstrably make it clear
                           that the said provision was not meant for candidates like the
                           respondent. As a matter of fact, under the garb of the said
                           notification, the respondent managed to get her form registered with
                           the appellant and when this discrepancy was discovered, the
                           appellant chose to set it right which in our opinion was perfectly
                           justified. The respondent cannot plead any estoppel either by
                           conduct or against a statute so as to gain any advantage of the fact
                           that she was allowed to appear in the examination.
                5.         Thus, after reviewing the various case-laws, the Apex Court came to
                the conclusion that the principle of equitable estoppel did not apply to the
                facts of Surjeet Kaur case (supra) and observed thus:

  (2010) 4 SCC 393: (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 162: AIR 2010 SC 1099

                           “18. There can be no estoppel/promissory estoppel against the
                      legislature in the exercise of the legislative function nor can the
                      Government or public authority be debarred from enforcing a
                      statutory prohibition. Promissory estoppel being an equitable
                      doctrine, must yield when the equity so requires. [Vide H.S. Rikhy
                      (Dr.) v. New Delhi Municipal Committee 6, M.I. Builders (P) Ltd.
                      v. Radhey Shyam Sahu 7, Shish Ram v. State of Haryana 8,
                      Chandra Prakash Tiwari v. Shakuntala Shukla 9, ITC Ltd. v.

                      Devi Sarup 12.]
                           19. On the other hand, the conduct of the respondent was such
                      that even though she had no statutory right or any vested right to
                      pursue her BEd course, the mistake on the part of the appellant to
                      allow her to appear in the examination cannot be by any logic
                      treated to be a conduct of the appellant to confer any such right on
                      the respondent. The rules and regulations cannot be allowed to be
                      defeated merely because the appellant erroneously allowed the
                      respondent to appear in the BEd examination. The records reveal
                      that the respondent did not challenge the cancellation of her results
                      in respect of the 1995 examination. The said order attained finality.
                      The respondent straightaway approached the District Forum in the
                      year 2000 for the conferment of BEd degree in pursuance of the
                      examinations conducted under the Notification dated 16-3-1998.
                      This, in the opinion of the Court, was a totally misdirected approach
                      and the District Forum fell into error by granting the relief.”
              6.      On comparative reading of the two decisions of the Apex Court in
              Shri Krishan case (supra) and Surjeet Kaur case (supra), it is noticed
              that there are evident conflict between the two decisions. Shri Krishan
              case was rendered by a three-Judge Bench whereas Surjeet Kaur case,
              even though latter in point of time, was decided a two-Judge Bench. The

            question is which of the two judgments are to be followed by this Court
            while deciding this writ petition. Article 141 of the Constitution
            categorically provides that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be
            binding on all courts within the territory of India. The aforesaid Article
            empowers the Supreme Court to declare the law. It is, therefore, an
            essential function of the Court to interpret a legislation. The statements of
            the Court on matters other than law like facts may have no binding force
            as the facts of two cases may not be similar. But what is binding is the
            ratio of the decision and not any finding of facts. It is the principle found
            out upon a reading of a judgment as a whole, in the light of the questions
            before the Court that forms the ratio and not any particular word or
            sentence. To determine whether a decision has “declared law” it cannot be
            said to be a law when a point is disposed of on concession and what is
            binding is the principle underlying a decision.
            7.     A judgment of the Court has to be read in the context of questions
            which arose for consideration in the case in which the judgment was
            delivered. An “obiter dictum” as distinguished from a ratio decidendi is an
            observation by the Court on a legal question suggested in a case before it
            but not arising in such manner as to require a decision. Such an obiter
            may not have a binding precedent as the observation was unnecessary for
            the decision pronounced, but even though an obiter may not have a
            binding effect as a precedent, but it cannot be denied that it is of
            considerable weight. The law which will be binding under Article 141
            would, therefore, extend to all observations of points raised and decided by
            the Court in a given case. In my opinion, ratio laid down in Shri Krishan
            case and Surjeet Kaur case are thus in conflict with each other. What is
            to be done then? The law is now well-settled that the decision of a larger
            Bench is always binding upon the smaller Bench.─ See Aneeta Hada v.
            Godfather Travels and Tours, (2012) 5 SCC 651. If the decision
            rendered by the larger bench of the Apex Court is binding upon the
            smaller bench of the Apex Court, then, a fortiori, there is no reason why
            the decision rendered by the three-Judge Bench in Shri Krishan case,
            rather than the decision rendered by the two-Judge Bench in Surjeet
            Kaur case, though latter in point of time, should not be binding upon and
            followed by this Court. So understood, the University-respondents are,
WP(C) No. 5632/11                                                                   Page 10 of 11

            therefore, barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from cancelling the
            examination of the petitioner or from withholding the result of her B.A.
            Part-II Examination held in 1999 once they had, rightly or wrongly,
            allowed her to sit in the examination.
            8.    The offshoot of the foregoing discussion is that this writ petition
            succeeds. The decision of the University-respondents conveyed by the
            Controller of Examination, Dibrugarh University in his letter dated 10-2-
            2011 is hereby quashed. The University-respondents are, therefore,
            directed to declare the result of the examination of the petitioner in B.A.
            Part-II of the three years degree course commencing on 4-5-1999 within
            two weeks from the date of receipt of this judgment. No costs.
