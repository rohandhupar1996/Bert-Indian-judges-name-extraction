          PRESENT
                             THE HON’BLE SHRI JUSTICE B.K.NAYAK
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Date of hearing : 13.08.2014 :               Date of judgment: 02.09.2014
B.K.NAYAK, J.            This appeal has been filed by the plaintiff challenging the
          judgment and part decree respectively dated 27.04.2004 and 12.05.2004
          passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division),Bhanjanagar in Title
          Suit No.9 of 2001.
          2.             The plaintiff-appellant filed the suit for partition of the suit
          properties and allotment of her legitimate share therein. Her case is that
          part of the suit properties stands recorded in the name of her mother,
          Sita Pradhan, which were her streedhan properties and the rest are the
          ancestral properties of her father, Prahalad. Prahalad and Sita had three
          daughters, namely, Chandrakala, Ahalya and Pramila (plaintiff) and had
          no male issue. Chandrakala is dead and defendant nos.3 and 2

                                       2
respectively are her husband and daughter. Ahalya-defendant no.4 died
during the pendency of the suit leaving behind defendant nos.4 (a) to 4(e),
defendant no.7 and defendant no.1 as her sons and daughters. Defendant
nos.5, 6, 8 and 9 are purchasers of some of the suit properties. It is
averred by the plaintiff that during 1971, Prahalada executed an adoption
deed in favour of defendant no.1 without the consent of his wife, Sita
Pradhan. No adoption ceremony as required under Hindu Law was
performed.    Sita died in the year 1983 and Prahalad died in the year
1992. It is specifically alleged that defendant no.1 is not the adopted son
of Prahalad Pradhan and Sita Pradhan, but he has sold away some lands
out of the suit properties to defendant nos.5, 6 and 9 without the consent
of the plaintiff and other LRs of Prahalad and Sita and, therefore, those
sale deeds are void and not binding on the plaintiffs and other LRs of
Prahalad.    Defendant no.7 has also managed to record her name in
respect of some part of the suit properties behind the back of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff, therefore, sought for the relief of partition and allotment of
legitimate share therein.
3.           Defendant nos.2 and 3 filed a joint written statement
supporting the case of the plaintiff and denying the adoption of defendant
no.1 by Prahalad stating further that they had no objection for partition of
the suit properties and allotment of 1/3rd share to them jointly.
4.           Defendant nos.1 and 5 to 7 filed a joint statement stating that
defendant no.1 was the adopted son of Prahalad Pradhan and Sita
Pradhan. He is the natural son of Ahalya Pradhan, who was the second
daughter of Prahalada Pradhan and Sit Pradhan. The adoption took place

                                     3
on the Sripanchamee day of the year 1965 in presence of friends and
relation when defendant no.1 was only four years old. Giving and taking
ceremony as well as other functions and feast were performed on the date
of the adoption. Since the date of his adoption, defendant no.1 has been
treated as the son of Prahalad and Sita and is recognized as such by the
plaintiff and all others. Defendant no.1 was given education by his
adoptive parents and that Prahalad has been described as the father of
defendant no.1 in the records of educational Institutions. Subsequently,
in the year 1971 Prahalad executed a registered deed acknowledging
previous adoption of defendant no.1 and all his daughters including the
plaintiff have signed on the said deed. Prahalad during his lifetime was
managing the entire suit properties with the assistance of defendant no.1
and has gifted some of his properties to his three daughters through
registered gift deeds and the daughters entered into possession of the
gifted properties and therefore, they are not entitled to further share out
of the suit properties. Defendant no.1 is the absolute owner of the suit
properties after the death of Sita and Prahalad and is in exclusive
possession over the same. Sita Pradhan had no Streedhan Properties, but
some properties were purchased in her name by Prahalad, out of the
income derived from the properties of Prahalad, which was ancestral in
nature and, therefore, the property recorded in the name of Sita Pradhan
is to be treated as ancestral property of Prahalad which devolved on
defendant no.1 alone. Prahalad and Sita had donated some lands to
defendant no.7 with the knowledge of the plaintiff and her sisters and the
said land now stands recorded in the name of defendant no.7, who is the

                                     4
owner in possession thereof. Defendant no.1 being the owner of the
properties, had alienated some part of it and the purchasers are in
possession over the same.
             Though defendant no.4 did not file any written statement, but
after her death defendant nos.4 (a) to 4 (e) adopted the written statement
filed by defendant nos.1, 8 and 9.
5.           On the pleadings of the parties, the trial court framed nine
issues, out of which Issue Nos.4 and 5 relate to adoption of defendant
no.1 by Prahalad and Sita and the validity of the registered deed of
acknowledgement of adoption. On consideration of the evidence, the trial
court recorded the finding that defendant no.1 is the adopted son of
Prahalad and Sita and that the deed of acknowledgment of adoption is a
valid deed. The trial court also came to hold that Prahalad and defendant
no.1 were the coparceners of the ancestral properties and all the three
daughters of Prahalad were already married and had been gifted away
some of the ancestral properties. After the death of Prahalad and Sita,
defendant no.1 became the sole surviving coparcener. It was also found
that during their lifetime Prahalad and Sita gifted some lands to
defendant no.7, which has been recorded in her name and that the sale of
part of the suit properties made by defendant no.1 in favour of defendant
nos.5 to 9 are valid. Ultimately, the trial court held that the lands
recorded in the name of Sita Pradhan being her Streedhan Property shall
be divided in equal shares amongst the branches of her three daughters
and defendant no.1. So far as the suit ancestral properties are concerned,
it was held that defendant no.1 was entitled to ten annas share by virtue

                                         5
of notional partition between Prahalad and defendant no.1 on the death of
Prahalad and the plaintiff and branches of two other deceased daughters
of Prahalad are entitled to two annas share each. It was also directed that
the properties already received by the plaintiff and her sisters from
Prahalad through registered gift deeds shall be adjusted towards their
respective shares and the portion of the suit properties sold by defendant
no.1 to defendant nos.5 to        9 shall be adjusted towards the share of
defendant no.1.
6.            In assailing the impugned judgment, the learned counsel for
the plaintiff-appellant raises the following contentions :
              (i)   that the finding of the trial court with regard to
                    adoption of defendant no.1-Prahalada is not correct in
                    view of the evidence on record;
              (ii)  that assuming that the defendant no.1 was the adopted
                    son of Prahalada, in view of the amendment of Section
                    6 of the Hindu Succession Act in 2005, all the three
                    daughters of Prahalad including the plaintiff became
                    coparceners with defendant no.1 and, therefore, the
                    plaintiff is entitled to 1/4th share in the suit ancestral
                    properties; and
              (iii) that the gift in favour of the daughters by Prahalad
                    having been found to be valid and being not brought to
                    the suit hotchpotch, the same cannot be adjusted
                    towards the share of the daughters in partition.

                                      6
7.             Learned counsel for defendant no.1-respondent no.1, on the
other hand, submits that there is no infirmity in the finding of the trial
court about the adoption of defendant no.1 by Prahalad and that
devolution of ancestral properties having taken place on the death of
Prahalad in 1992 by operation of law, the amended provision of Section 6
of the Hindu Succession Act,1956 shall have no application and,
therefore, the allotment of two annas share by the trial court to the
plaintiff is justified.
8.             With regard to the adoption of defendant no.1 by Prahalad, it
is seen that the evidence of DWs.2, 3, 4 and 5 is relevant. D.W.4 is a
barber and D.W.5 is the cousin brother of Prahalad. Both have clearly
stated that Prahalad had no male issue except three daughters including
the plaintiff and so he adopted defendant no.1, natural son of Ahalya, on
the Sripanchamee day in the year 1965. The adoption ceremony took
place in the house of Prahalad. The barber, priest and daughters of
Prahalad and other relatives were present, and that during the ceremony,
the natural parents of defendant no.1 gave defendant no.1 in adoption
and Prahalad and Sita accepted him as their adopted son. Since the date
of adoption, defendant no.1 stayed in the house of Prahalad, who gave
him education. Nothing substantial was brought out in the cross-
examination of these witnesses to discredit their evidence. D.W.3 is the
natural mother of defendant no.1 and the second daughter of Prahalad.
Her testimony is clear about giving defendant no.1 in adoption to
Prahalad. D.W.2 is defendant no.1 himself. He has also clearly stated
about his adoption by Prahalad. Evidence with regard to execution of the

                                     7
registered deed of acknowledgement of adoption of defendant no.1 in the
year 1971 is quite clear to the effect that Prahalad and all his three
daughters signed on the deed. As against such evidence, the evidence of
the plaintiff, who has been examined as P.W.1, is to the effect that
without her knowledge Ahalya gave defendant no.1 in adoption to
Prahalad. It appears from her evidence that she was not present during
the adoption ceremony. But at the same time, she did not raise any
objection when she signed the deed of adoption. She states that she came
to know about the adoption of defendant no.1 by Prahalad only when she
signed the adoption deed. It is also clear from her evidence that neither
she nor anybody else questioned the adoption of defendant no.1 during
the lifetime of Prahalad and Sita. The evidence on record also clearly
reveals that Prahalad had gifted away some properties to all his three
daughters and that defendant no.1 was staying in his house from the
time of his adoption and has been looking after the properties after the
death of Prahalad. Defendant no.1 has also performed the funeral
ceremony of his adoptive parents. It is thus clear from the evidence that
the trial court has assessed the evidence properly and come to the right
conclusion that defendant no.1 is the adopted son of Prahalad.
9.           With regard to the second contention of the learned counsel
for the appellant that by virtue of amendment of Section 6 of the Hindu
Succession Act,1956 in 2005, the plaintiff is entitled to 1/4th share in the
suit ancestral properties, it is necessary to see the provisions of the
original Section 6 and the amendment thereof effected in 2005.

                                       8
            Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act,1956 prior to its
amendment runs as under :
                  “6.   Devolution       of  interest   in    coparcenary
                  property- When a male Hindu dies after the
                  commencement of this Act, having at the time of his
                  death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary
                  property, his interest in the property shall devolve
                  by survivorship upon the surviving members of the
                  coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act:
                         Provided that, if the deceased had left him
                  surviving a female relative specified in class I of the
                  Schedule or a male relative specified in that class
                  who claims through such female relative, the
                  interest   of  the     deceased   in   the   Mitakshara
                  coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary
                  or intestate succession, as the case may be, under
                  this Act and not by survivorship.
                         Explanation 1- For the purposes of this
                  section,   the   interest   of  a   Hindu    Mitakshara
                  coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the
                  property that would have been allotted to him if a
                  partition   of    the    property   had    taken   place
                  immediately     before    his   death   irrespective  of
                  whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.
                         Explanation 2- Nothing contained in the
                  proviso to this section shall be construed as
                  enabling a person who has separated himself from
                  the coparcenary before the death of the deceased or
                  any of his heirs to claim on intestacy a share in the
                  interest referred to therein.”
10.         Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act,1956 was in entirety
substituted by Section 3 of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act,2005

                                       9
(39 of 2005). The amended provision came into force with effect from
09.09.2005. Sub section (1) of amended Section 6, which is relevant for
our purpose runs as under :
             “6. Devolution of interest in coparcenary property –
             (1) On and from the commencement of the Hindu
             Succession (Amendment) Act,2005, in a Joint Hindu
             family governed by the Mitakshara law, the daughter of
             a coparcener shall,-
                    (a) by birth become a coparcener in her own right
                         in the same manner as the son;
                    (b) have the same rights in the coparcenary
                         property as she would have had if she had
                         been a son;
                    (c) be subject to the same liabilities in respect of
                         the said coparacenary property as that of a
                         son.
                    And    any   reference   to   a  Hindu   Mitakshara
                    coparcener shall be deemed to include a reference
                    to a daughter of a coparcener:
                           Provided that nothing contained in this sub-
                    section shall affect or invalidate any disposition or
                    alienation including any partition or testamentary
                    disposition of property which had taken place
                    before the 20th Day of December,2004.”
11.          Prior to enactment of Hindu Succession Act,1956, as per the
old Hindu law the undivided interest of a coparcener in the Mitakshara
joint family used to devolve on the surviving coparceners of the family.
Therefore, depending on the birth or death of a coparcener in the family,
the interest of other surviving coparceners used to be decreased or

                                     10
increased, as the case may be. Section 6 of 1956 Act recognized that very
principle of survivorship only with an exception to the effect that the
undivided interest of the coparcener in the joint family dying intestate
shall not devolved by survivorship upon the surviving members of the
coparcener only if the deceased left a female relative in class-1 of the
schedule of the Act or a male relative specified in that class, who claims
through such female relative. The interest of such deceased coparcener
was his share as per a notional partition at the time of his death as per
Explanation-1 appended to Section 6 of 1956 Act. Devolution of the
undivided interest of deceased coparcener takes effect immediately on his
death by operation of Section 6 and the same is never postponed.
12.          By virtue of 2005 amendment, Section 6 of 1956 Act has
been totally substituted. Sub-section (1) of the amended Section 6 now
gives the daughter of a coparcener in a Mitakshara Joint Hindu family the
status of a coparcener which she did not have prior to the amendment.
             The Hon’ble apex Court in the case reported in (2009) 6 SCC
99: G. Sekar v. Geetha and others held as follows :
                   “30. Neither the 1956 Act nor the 2005 Act seeks
                   to reopen vesting of a right where succession had
                   already been taken place. The operation of the
                   said statute is no doubt prospective in nature.
                   The High Court might have committed a mistake
                   in opining that the operation of Section 3 of the
                   2005 Act is retrospective in character, but, for the
                   reasons aforementioned, it does not make any
                   difference. What should have been held was that

                                        11
                     although it is not retrospective in nature, its
                     application is prospective.”
              It is apparent from the opening words of sub section (1) of
Section 6, as amended in 2005, that a daughter becomes a coparcener in
the   Mitakshara      Joint   Hindu   family    on  and   from   the   date  of
commencement of the amendment Act. Therefore, a pre-condition for the
applicability    of  this   new   provision  is   that  on   the  date   of its
commencement there must be a Mitakshara Joint Hindu family in
existence. The proviso to amended sub-section (1) makes it clear that the
right conferred on the daughter as a coparcener shall not affect or
invalidate any disposition or alienation including any partition or
testamentary disposition of property which had taken place before the
20th day of December,2004.         This, in other words, means that where
devolution of property of a deceased coparcener, has already taken place
prior to the 20th day of December,2004, such devolution would not be
affected by conferment of status of coparcener on a daughter by virtue of
the amendment. This view of mine gets support from a decision of the
Madras High Court reported in AIR 2008 MADRAS 250: Smt. Bagirathi
& Ors v. S. Manivanan & Anr. held as follows :
                     “13. A careful reading of Section 6 (1) read with 6
                     (3) of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act
                     clearly   indicates   that   a   daughter   can    be
                     considered as a coparcener only if her father was
                     a coparcener at the time of coming into force of
                     the amended provision. It is of course true that for
                     the purpose of considering whether the father is a

                                      12
                  coparcener or not, the restricted meaning of the
                  expression “partition” as given in the explanation
                  is to be attributed.
                  14. In the present case, admittedly the father of
                  the present petitioners had expired in 1975.
                  Section 6(1) of the Act is prospective in the sense
                  that a daughter is being treated as coparcener on
                  and from the commencement of the Hindu
                  Succession     (Amendment)     Act,2005.   If   such
                  provision is read along with Section 6(3), it
                  becomes     clear   that  if a   Hindu   dies   after
                  commencement         of  the   Hindu     Succession
                  (Amendment)       Act,2005,  his  interest   in  the
                  property shall devolve not by survivorship but by
                  intestate succession as contemplated in the Act.”
             The Delhi High Court in the decision reported in AIR 2007
DELHI 254 : Brij Narain Aggarwal v. Anup Kumar Goyal & Ors. held
as follows :
                  “8. The very opening words of S.6 (1) are “On and
                  from………. in a Joint Hindu Family”. Thus, sub-
                  section (1) envisages existence of a Joint Hindu
                  Family, when the amendment came into force and
                  right of the daughter in the HUF coparcenery is to
                  be determined if HUF is in existence. Thus, the
                  very first condition of the application of this
                  amended provision is that on the day when
                  amended Act came into force, an HUF governed by
                  Mitakshara law must be in existence. If Joint
                  Hindu Family is in existence on that day, the
                  daughter shall be a coparcener in the Joint Hindu
                  Family like any other son and shall have same

                                    13
                  right in the coparcenary as that of a son and shall
                  be subject to the same liabilities in respect of the
                  said coparcenary property as a son would be. If no
                  HUF     is  in  existence  on    that   day,  when
                  amendment came into force, the question of
                  daughter being coparcener does not arise. …. … ”
13.         In the case in hand, admittedly, Prahalad and defendant no.1
constituted a Mitakshara Joint Hindu family on the date of adoption of
defendant no.1 in 1965. Undisputedly, Prahalad died in the year 1992
and his wife had pre-deceased him about ten years before and all the
daughters of Prahalad including the petitioner had already gone on
marriage prior to adoption of defendant no.1. On the death of Prahalad,
the petitioner became the sole surviving male member and Prahalad’s
undivided interest in the suit coparcenery properties devolved by way of
intestate succession on his legal heirs (his adopted son and three
daughters) in accordance with un-amended provision of Section 6 of 1956
Act along with Explanation-1 thereof. On a notional partition taking place
on the death of Prahalad in the year 1992 between him and defendant
no.1, each of them would have been entitled to half share in the suit joint
family properties and the half share of Prahalad would devolve in equal
share on defendant no.1 and his three daughters as the daughters are
Class-1 female heirs. Such devolution or disposition of property having
already taken place by virtue of law existing prior to the amendment of
Section 6 in 2005, such devolution creates a vested right in the legal

                                        14
heirs, which cannot be re-opened after coming into force of the 2005
amendment.
14.            In the aforesaid view of the matter, the decree of the trial
court granting ten annas share to defendant no.1 and two annas share to
each of the daughters of Prahalad or their branches including the plaintiff
in the suit coparcenary properties is justified. Thus, the second
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner-appellant fails.
15.            So far as the direction of the trial court for adjustment of the
properties transferred by way of gift by Prahalad in favour of his
daughters towards their shares is concerned, the same cannot be
sustained inasmuch as the gifted properties were not the subject matter
of the suit and that the daughters have already derived title to such
properties. Therefore, the direction of the trial court for adjustment of the
properties gifted by Prahalad to his daughters towards their shares is set
aside.
               The appeal is allowed only to this extent. No costs.
