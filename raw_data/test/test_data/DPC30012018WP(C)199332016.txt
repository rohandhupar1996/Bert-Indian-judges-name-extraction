      PRESENT:
                   THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE D.P.CHOUDHURY
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of hearing:08.11.2017                  Date of Judgment:30.01.2018
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. D.P.Choudhury, J. Since both the writ petitions arise out of common
      cause of action and raise common question of law, they are being taken
      up together and are disposed of by this common judgment.
      2.           The conspectus of the case of the petitioners’ are that the
      petitioners in W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016 are Sarpanchs of 26 different
      Gram Panchayats of three blocks in the district of Sundergarh and they
      used the public road MDR Road-27 of the said district from Bankibahal
      to Sundergarh, but due to plying of the multi-axle vehicles (18 to 22
      wheelers), the condition of the road became worsen and the people of
      these panchayats felt inconvenience to use such road.
      3.           It is alleged inter alia that on 14.10.2015, the villagers of
      these Panchayats made representation to the Collector, Sundergarh and
      simultaneously they agitated the matter before the Secretary to

                                     -3-
Government in Commerce and Transport Department. On 17.10.2015,
the   Chief    Engineer  D.P.I.   Road,   basing   on  the  report  of   the
Superintendent Engineer, wrote a letter to the Secretary to Government,
Works Department that the existing road is deficient to sustain plying of
18 to 22 wheelers and suggested that there should be restriction on
multi-axle    vehicles.  Then,   the   Secretary  to  Government,    Works
Department called for a report from the concerned employees of Works
Department and on 19.10.2015, Works Department requested the
Collector to pass appropriate order under Section 115 of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter called “the Act, 1988”) restricting the
movement of multi-axle vehicles. At the same time, on 05.09.2013, the
Collector deferred the introduction of multi-axle vehicles till opening of
new mines under MCL because the MCL was utilizing the road for
transportation of coal.
4.            As there was no sufficient road for transportation of general
public and other small vehicles, it was not incumbent for the opposite
parties to allow plying such vehicles. Because of the traffic congestion,
the carcinogenic pollution crops up affecting daily life of the general
public. It is the case of the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016 that
at the cost of the lives of general public, there cannot be carrying of coal
by the transporters. Since the heavy vehicles magnificently violate the
pollution control laws framed under the Environment (Protection Act),
1986 and the Rules framed thereunder, the plying of multi-axle vehicles
cause serious pollution hazards because of plying of such large number
of heavy commercial vehicles.

                                     -4-
5.           The District Collector, without following the parameters and
the pollution laws, allowed the multi-axle vehicles holding that said
vehicles can participate in transportation having no restriction from the
administration. Although there is letter of the Executive Engineer,
Sundergarh to the Collector to consider the widening of two lane to four
lane from Bankibahal to Kanika Railway but the order was passed by the
Collector allowing the multi-axle vehicles.
6.           In the aforesaid writ petition, there is mention of another
writ petition, i.e, W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015 filed by one M/s.Biswajit
Minerals Pvt. Limited. That matter was disposed of by this Court by a
Single Bench of this Court allowing the multi-axle vehicles to ply but the
said order was challenged before the Division Bench in a writ appeal
vide W.A. No.635 of 2015 wherein the judgment of this Court passed by
the Single Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to this
Court for fresh adjudication. Since the order passed by the Single Bench
has been set aside and there is already a provision under Section 115 of
the Act, 1988 to restrict the use of vehicle by the State Government, the
effective measure should be taken by passing relevant order in that
case. So, in the aforesaid writ petitions, it is prayed to declare the road
from Bankibahal to Sundergarh as no plying zone/no traffic zone for the
multi-axle vehicles and further prayed to quash the order dated
17.10.2015 passed by the Engineer-in-Chief (Civil), Odisha under
Annexure-2 and order dated 19.10.2015 passed by the Joint Secretary
to Government in Commerce and Transport (Transport) Department
under Annexure-10.

                                    -5-
7.            As stated above, W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015 is also placed
for fresh adjudication along with the above writ petition because of the
remand order passed by the Division Bench of this Court in writ appeal.
It is reiterated that some of the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015
challenged the restriction upon them and that writ petition was allowed
directing the Collector to make arrangement for transportation of the
vehicles because due to the restriction, the business of the private
individual has been affected whereas Article 19 of the Constitution of
India allow for free trade and profession.
8.            The above two writ petitions are like case and counter case
because in W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015, petitioner claims a direction to
allow them to ply the vehicle for transportation of coal whereas in
W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016, the petitioners, being the villagers, opposed
the plying of multi-axle vehicles on the road from Bankibahal in the
district of Sundergarh.
9.            SUBMISSIONS
              Mr.Manoj Ku. Mishra, learned Senior Advocate for the
petitioners in W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016 submitted that the petitioners
are the villagers and affected more by plying of 16 axle vehicles on the
road in question. They alleged that due to use of these multi axle
vehicles, they are not able to use the road for carrying their children to
the school and transporting the patients to the hospitals and also not
able to go to market for purchase of their daily needs. Since the road is
used by these heavy vehicles, the condition of road becomes bad and
road is also not wide enough for plying of these vehicles.

                                   -6-
10.          Mr.Mishra, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners
further submitted that the petitioners, being the Sarpanchs of local
villages, they made representation to the Chief Secretary on 14.10.2015
expressing their difficulties which arrest their fundamental rights as
enshrined under Articles 21 and 21-A of the Constitution. Similarly, the
Chief Engineer, DPI and Roads, Bhubaneswar had written letter to the
Engineer-in-Chief-cum-Secretary to Government, Works Department on
17.10.2015 to put some restrictions for plying of multi axle vehicles. He
also drew attention of the Court to Sections 115 and 116 of the Act,
1988 where the State Government has got duty to make restrictions for
use of the road by the class and classes of vehicles. The Division Bench
of this Court in W.A. No.635 of 2015 expressing concerned over the
issue in question with regard to the exercise of power under Section 115
of the Act, 1988 for imposing restriction on plying of multi axle vehicles,
remanded the matter to this Court by setting aside the judgment passed
by the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015, which is also
being disposed of along with this writ petition. So, the present
petitioners support the plea of the appellants in W.A. No.365 of 2015
arising out W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015.
11.          Mr.Manoj Kumar Mishra, learned Senior Advocate for the
petitioners further contended that the Court, in order to find out the
factual scenario, appointed a Multi Technical Committee vide order dated
09.01.2017 to inspect the road again and give a report to the Court. The
Multi Technical Committee had visited the spot in question and given its
report in two parts. According to him, the Multi Technical Committee has

                                     -7-
also found that the road condition is not good enough for plying of multi
axle vehicles and he referred to the letter dated 17.10.2015 (Annexure-
11) wherein the Executive Engineer, Sundergarh (R &B), Sundergarh
wrote    letter  to  the    Chief  Engineer,  (D.P.I  &   Roads),   Odisha,
Bhubaneswar for improvement of the existing road to carry such heavy
traffic so as to ply multi axle vehicles to avoid accidents and traffic
congestions.
12.           Further it is submitted by Mr.Mishra, learned Senior Advocte
for the petitioners that in the counter affidavit, the opposite parties 2
and 3 also admitted that the condition of the road is not good enough
and MCL, Vasundhara has also agreed to deposit Rs.45.00 lakhs as
temporary restoration for the damages. As such until and unless the
condition of the road is improved, it is difficult to allow the multi axle
vehicles to ply over the road in question. He drew attention of the Court
to the observation of this Court in its order dated 16.07.2012 passed in
W.P.(C) No.11744 of 2012 wherein this Court had been pleased to
observe that there is heavy traffic problem for which local people at
large of the nearby villages are suffering and they find it difficult to
attend hospitals, district office, schools and colleges due to blockage for
which this Court directed the District Collector to conduct a meeting with
the high officials of MCL and take suitable measures so as not to cause
much problem to the public at large and there should be restriction for
plying of other heavy vehicles. He also submitted that Article 21 of the
Constitution gives the mandate and guarantees the commuters a hazard
free road. When the right of the public/community is pitted against

                                    -8-
Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, the community right shall have to
prevail over the individual right as contained in Article 19(1)(g). In
support of his contentions, he relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Zakir Hussain and others –V- State of
Maharashtra and another; AIR 2001 Bom 21. Finally, he argued
that letter dated 19.10.2015 issued by the State Government in
Commerce and Transport (Transport) Department to the Collector,
Sundergarh to take immediate appropriate action under Section 115 of
the Act, 1988 and other relevant sections as would be necessary under
the said Act till improvement of the road as recommended by the
Engineer-in-Chief-Cum-Secretary to Government, Works Department
vide Annexure-10 and the same letter should be implemented at once.
Lastly, he submitted that in the alternative, the Collector, Sundergarh
may be directed to pass necessary order for passage of multi axle
vehicles at a particular hours for not causing any undue hardship to the
general public to perform their day-to-day work by using the road in
question.
13.         Mr.Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate for the opposite party
no.5 submitted that the writ petition is not maintainable as none of the
villagers between Bankibahal to Sundergarh has filed this writ petition
as petitioner for which such writ petition is not maintainable. He also
drew the attention of the Court to W.P.(C) No.21100 of 2014 wherein
this Court has made observation that multi axle vehicles have got also
right to earn their livelihood and if multi axel vehicles would run, it
would reduce number of other vehicles to carry the volumes of

                                    -9-
materials. So, in that writ petition, this Court directed the opposite
party-authority to make provision for smooth functioning of multi axle
vehicles. So, the petitioners cannot restrict plying of multi axle vehicles
which on the other hand, carry the coal for economic growth of the
country. The fundamental right of the opposite party no.5 has also to be
respected by the opposite party-State and District Authority. He drew
attention of the Court to Article 19(1)(d) and (g) of the Constitution. It
is for the State Government and District Authority to pass suitable order
under Section 115 of the Act, 1988 for use of the road to avoid any
inconvenience to any public or individual. Under no circumstance, the
fundamental right of the petitioners to carry out their profession on their
trade can be restricted or violated.
14.          Mr.J.Pattnaik,  learned  Senior    Advocate    for  the   MCL
submitted that the multi axle vehicles are required to carry the coal by
using the road in question. Since the multi axle vehicles are carrying
huge quantity of coal, there is no necessity of more numbers of small
heavy vehicles (Trucks) to carry material in piecemeal. According to
him, MCL is always committed for development of the road. He referred
to Annexures-2 and 10 wherein stress has been laid on commitment of
MCL to construct a new coal corridor (4-lane road) from Bankibahal to
Bhedabahal for which MOU has been signed with MCL authority by the
State Government and for that, MCL has already deposited Rs.45.00
lakhs as available from Annexure-10. Not only the MCL has committed
to develop the road but also it has got commitment for the local
villagers to commute properly for their livelihood. He referred to the

                                    - 10 -
counter affidavit filed by the Executive Engineer, (R&B) Division,
Sundergarh wherein the State Government has admitted that the
construction of coal corridor from Bankibahal to Bhedabahal with
Rs.398.00 crore has been sanctioned on 12.07.2017 and tender process
has been initiated during October, 2014. After construction of coal
corridor, all the traffic will move through the dedicated coal corridor
from bankibahal to Bhedabahal.
15.          Mr.Pattnaik, learned Senior Advocate for the MCL further
contended that MCL has also contributed money for Vasundhara Coal
Mines to Jharsuguda and Bankibahal to Kanika railway siding. So,
appropriate order may be passed for not causing any disturbances to
MCL to carry on business in the best interest of the Nation.
16.          Mr.B.K.Sharma, learned Standing Counsel for the Transport
Department submitted that Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution do not
overlap with each other. Article 19(1)(d) and (g) although allow freedom
to move the territory and also for a free profession to carry on for the
livelihood but Clasue-6 of Article 19 of the Constitution gives power to
the State Government to put reasonable restriction. According to him,
Section 115 of the Act, 1988 read with Rule 173 of Motor Vehicles Rules
allow the State Government and District Authority to put reasonable
restriction for use of the road for the larger interest of the public. For
that, the Transport Department issued necessary instruction from time
to time to the District Collector to pass necessary orders for movement
of the vehicle of specific class or classes in order to reduce the accident
in a particular area. Not only this but also the State Government can

                                   - 11 -
cause appropriate traffic signals to be erected under Section 116 of the
Act, 1988 at a suitable place.
17.          Mr.Sharma, learned Standing Counsel for the Transport
Department further contended that the Transport Department already
issued a letter under Annexure-10 to the District Collector to put some
restrictions so that neither the villagers nor the transporters will face
any problem but the restrictions must be satisfying the doctrine of
reasonableness. So, the District Collector is authorized to issue
necessary     order  after  taking   the  fact  and   circumstances  into
consideration so that neither the transporters nor the public would
suffer. He emphasized on issuance of order under Section 115 of the
Act, 1988. After 2005, there has been many improvements of the road
as on the date in 2017. So, the State Government in Transport
Department has no any consequences to follow except the Collector to
consider all factors and pass necessary orders.
18.          Mr.P.Mohapatra, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the
State submitted that according to the affidavit of the Executive
Engineer, the work has been completed and there is no any basis of the
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners in both the writ
petitions. He, agreeing with the contention of Mr.Sharma, learned
Standing Counsel for the Transport Department, submitted that the
State Government has already authorized the Collector to issue
necessary order under Section 115 of the Act, 1988. Accordingly, the
Collector is to implement the instruction of the State Government.

                                    - 12 -
19.          Since the same issue is involved in W.P.(C) No.19266 of
2015, the above arguments have been adopted by respective counsels
even if some of the petitioners in the said writ petition are opposite
party to W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016.
20.          POINT FOR CONSIDERATION
             The main point for consideration is as to whether the road
from Bankibahal to Sundergarh can be restricted for plying of multi axle
vehicles as per Annexure-10?
21.          DISCUSSIONS
             It is not in dispute that the road from Bankibahal to
Sundergarh     is  motorable    road   used   by   the   local villagers and
transporters. It is admitted fact that the multi axle vehicles by opposite
party no.5 were allowed to ply on the road but the local representative
of the people expressed their grievance as to inconvenience faced by
them to the Authority. It is not in dispute that due to complain by the
public,   the   Executive   Engineer    (R&B)    Division,   Sundergarh,  on
17.10.2015, gave a report to the Superintendent Engineer to put certain
restriction on the heavy truck and multi axle vehicles till the existing
road is repaird. It is also admitted fact that basing on the report,
Secretary to Government, Works Department wrote a letter on
19.10.2015 to the District Collector to exercise power under Section 115
of the Act, 1988 and other sections so as to restrict the movement of
the multi axle vehicles till the condition of the road is suitably improved.
The present opposite party no.5 in W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016 earlier
filed W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015 before this Court and this Court, vide

                                        - 13 -
order dated 26.10.2015, disposed of the said writ petition. Operative
portion of the order dated 26.10.2015 is quoted hereunder for better
reference:
                    “26.10.2015.
                    Xx      xx      xx    xx
                    Having perused the pleadings and documents produced
            by the petitioner and O.P.4 and having heard the learned
            counsel for the respective parties, it appears that the concerned
            road is maintained by MCL and any restriction on transportation
            of coal shall have serious implications not only on MCL’s
            productivity but also on the industries and other end-users
            including power plants. Ultimately, it will have a serious impact
            on public interest.
                    Undisputed, use of high capacity vehicles reduces traffic
            congestion, road safety and environmental pollution while
            accelerating the economic progress. Any restriction has to have
            reasonable nexus with rights granted under the Constitution. It
            is evident that the letter under Annexure-2 had been issued
            without considering all these aspects by giving an opportunity
            of being heard to all the stake holders.
                    Therefore, the impugned order is quashed and the writ
            petition is disposed of accordingly.
                    It is made clear that any damage to the road shall be
            repaired by the MCL and the Collector of the district shall
            monitor the same.
                    Since this order has been passed without noticing the
            MCL, which is not a party to the present proceeding, it is open
            to it to get itself impleaded as a party and seek variance of this
            order.
                    A copy of this order along with a copy of the writ petition
            be communicated to the Collector, Sundergarh, who is the
            Chairman of the RTA, for compliance through a Special
            Messenger, cost of which shall be assessed and deposited by 4th
            November, 2015.”
            From a perusal of the aforesaid order, it appears that the
Court has found to have taken into consideration the public interest with
regard to the productivity of the MCL and other interest. In that order,
the doctrine of reasonableness qua the rights guaranteed under the
Constitution have also been discussed. However, the judgment of the
learned Single Judge was carried in Writ Appeal No.635 of 2015 and the
Division Bench of this Court remanded the writ petition allowing the
opposite party to be heard in the matter as they are also users of the

                                       - 14 -
road. So, the remand order again brought the matter to square one for
which the present judgment also is taken care along with W.P.(C)
No.19933 of 2016 filed by some Sarpanchs of local panchayats.

            Odisha, Bhubaneswar
            Sub: Movement of Multi Axle Vehicles of MDR-27 from
            Sundergarh to Taparia under (R&B) Division, Sundargarh:-
            Submission of Report
            Reference: Letter No.430002 dated 17.10.15 of S.E. Roads,
            Odisha, Bhubaneswar
            Sir,
                   In inviting a kind reference to the subject cited above, I
            am to intimate that the Sundergarh to Taparia Road, i.e,
            Sundergarh to Bankibahal is of 40 Km length comprising of
            MDR-27, MDR-29 & ODR (MDR-27=22 KM, MDR-29=13.00 KM
            & ODR=5 Km). This road was handed over to MCL in the year
            1998 and the road is now being maintained by MCL.
                   The point wise report is described below for kind
            reference
            1.     The road Sundergarh to Bankibahal Road was entrusted
            to the MCL authority for improvement vide letter No.10053
            Dated 07.04.1998 of the Deputy Secretary, Works Department,
            Government of Odisha, and no MoU has been signed at that
            time.
            2.     The existing road was developed by MCL in the existing
            alignment within exiting horizontal curves and Vertical curves.
            The existing crust thickness of the road varies from 400mm to
            500mm. Now considering the traffic density & CBR of the
            subgrade, the crust thickness should be from 600 mm to
            750mm. The horizontal curves of the road needs to be
            improved. Secondly there are 82 Nos. of existing CD on the
            road excluding the bridge. The foundation and sub-structure of
            the maximum cross drainage are of boulder masonary & road
            width of the culvert varies from 7.50 Mtr to 10 Mtr. The culvert
            should be reconstructed to facilitate the existing traffic of 5303
            Nos (CVPD). There are 2 Nos. Of Major Bridge and 5 Nos. Minor
            bridges with the carriageway of 7.5 Mtr width. The major
            bridges were constructed in the year 1962.

                                        - 16 -
            3.              There are 4 major villages on the road namely
            Ujjalpur, Chhatenapli, Balichuan and Kundara and the existing
            width of the carriageway is 7.00 Mtr. Since there is constraint
            of carriageway in the village area, the movement of Multi Axle
            vehicles (18 to 22 wheelers) are creating problem for the daily
            users of the road.
            4.       As per traffic census held on 12/2013, the PCU of the
            road was 19301. As per MoRTH guidelines with PCU more than
            13000 in the rolling areas, it is recommended that road width
            should be 10 Mtr width & the formation width of the road be 12
            Mtr. The existing formation varies from 9 Mtr to 12 Mtr which
            also disturbs the movement of vehicles. Further it is to mention
            that, there are 1383 Nos. Of tress adjacent to the BT edge of
            road which is causing problems to the movement of vehicles
            with longer dimension.
            5.       To cater the present traffic volumes, it has been
            proposed to construct a new Coal Corridor (4-lane road) from
            Bankibahal to Bhedabahal for which MoU has been signed with
            MCL authority.
            6.       At present, it has been proposed to improve the road
            and widened the carriageway of the road from 7.00 mtrs to
            10.00 mtrs for which an estimated amounting to
            Rs.75,61,21,142/- has been submitted to the MCL vide this
            office No.5136 Dated 28.08.2015. But no work has been taken
            up till now.
            Recommendation
            Considering the points like standing trees on the road side,
            dilapidated condition of the Culverts, deficient Horizontal
            Curves, the existing road is not sufficient to carry such heavy
            traffic, so the road may be improved to the Ministry Standard
            for plying of Multi Axle Vehicles (Traller of 18 to 22 Nos. Of
            Wheels with longer dimension) to avoid accidents & traffic
            congestions.
            This is for favour of your kind information & necessary action.

                                           Sundergarh (R&B) Division”
            The aforesaid two letters under Annexures-10 and 11 are
only advisory in nature giving authority to the Collector to pass orders.
The Collector, Sundergarh, opposite party no.3 is absolutely free to pass
any order by exercising power under Section 115 of the Act, 1988.

                                           - 17 -
Before exercising the power, what should be the criteria for passing
such order under the provision of the Act, 1988?
23.           Articles 19(1)(d), 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution is
placed below in the following manner for better reference:
              “19. Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech
              etc:
              (1) All citizens shall have the right
                                        Xx      xx    xx
              (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;
                                        Xx      xx    xx
              (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation,
              trade or business
                                        Xx      xx    xx
              21. Protection of life and personal liberty No person shall be
              deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to
              procedure established by law”
              From the aforesaid provision of the Indian Constitution, it is
clear that right to free movement throughout the Indian territory is
enshrined under Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution which contemplates
nothing else but absence of inter-State restrictions, which might prevent
citizens of the Indian Union moving from one State to another.
Therefore, Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution guarantees the free right
to all citizens to go wherever they like in the Indian territory without any
kind of restriction whatsoever. They can move not merely from one
State to another but from one place to another within the same State
and what the Constitution lays stress upon is that the entire Indian
territory is one unit so far as the citizens are concerned. In Mithilesh
Garg etc. etc. –V- Union of India and others etc. etc.; AIR 1992
SC 443, Article 19(1)(g) with regard to the profession or practice a
citizen has right to carry on has been well explained by the Hon’ble

                                         - 18 -
Supreme Court at paragraph-10 of the said judgment and the same is
given below in the following manner:
             “Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India guarantees to all
             citizens the right to practice any profession, or to carry on any
             occupation, trade or business subject to reasonable restrictions
             imposed by the State under Article 19(6) of the Constitution of
             India. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Saghir Ahmad v.
             The State of U.P. and Others, (1955) 1 S.C.R. 707 held that the
             fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) entitles any member
             of the public to carry on the business of transporting
             passengers with the aid of the vehicles. Mukerjea, J. speaking
             for the Court observed as under:
                     "Within the limits imposed by State regulations any
             member of the public can ply motor vehicles on a public road.
             To that extent he can also carry on the business of transporting
             passengers with the aid of the vehicles. It is to this carrying on
             of the trade or business that the guarantee in Article 19(1)(g)
             is attracted and a citizen can legitimately complain if any
             legislation takes away or curtails that right any more than is
             permissible under clause (6) of that article."
                     It is thus a guaranteed fight of every citizen whether
             rich or poor to take up and carry on, if he so wishes, the motor
             transport business. It is only the State which can impose
             reasonable restrictions within the ambit of Article 19(6) of the
             Constitution of India. Section 47(3) and 57 of the old Act were
             some of the restrictions which were imposed by the State on
             the enjoyment of the right under Article 19(1)(g) so far as the
             motor transport business was concerned..........”
             With due regard to the aforesaid decision, it is clear that
Article 21 of the Constitution gives every right to life and property and
the same can be only restricted by reasonable law duly communicated
or processed. All these provisions have got one way or other restrictions
for the public interest. It is not true to say that Article 21 of the
Constitution takes care of Article 19 in all cases. The difference between
Articles 19 and 21 is that Article 19 can be exercised in certain cases by
a citizen whereas Article 21 is directed against any person with regard to
livelihood or life.

                                         - 19 -
24.          Now adverting to the present case, when the public have got
right to use the road for their livelihood, the transporter has got freedom
of profession or carry on business for their livelihood by moving from
State to State. All these matters can be restricted by Clause (6) of
Article 19 of the Constitution where the freedom is available under
Article 19(1)(d) and (g), as discussed above in the aforesaid judgment
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Therefore, it is pertinent to observe that
Section 115 of the Act, 1988 has been enacted with avowed object to
restrict the movement of any specific class or classes of vehicles to
minimum subject to condition that public road or the particular area, the
object is only to protect the interest of public safety or convenience.
Section 115 of the Act, 1988 is placed below for reference:
             “115. Power to restrict the use of vehicles:-The State
             Government or any authority authorised in this behalf by the
             State Government, if satisfied that it is necessary in the
             interest of public safety or convenience, or because of the
             nature of any road or bridge, may, by notification in the Official
             Gazette, prohibit or restrict, subject to such exceptions and
             conditions as may be specified in the notification, the driving of
             motor vehicles or of any specified class or description of motor
             vehicles or the use of trailers either generally in a specified area
             or on a specified road and when any such prohibition or
             restriction is imposed, shall cause appropriate traffic signs to be
             placed or erected under section 116 at suitable places:
                     Provided that where any prohibition or restriction under
             this section is to remain in force for not more than one month,
             notification thereof in the Official Gazette shall not be
             necessary, but such local publicity as the circumstances may
             permit, shall be given of such prohibition or restriction.”
             The     aforesaid    provision      clearly    envisages      that   before
restricting the use of vehicles, the following conditions must be satisfied:
             “(1) Whether the restriction is necessary for the
             interest of public safety and convenience; and

                                      - 20 -
              (2) Whether the nature of road and bridge requires
              to put certain restrictions.”
              The above restriction as it appears should be aimed only to
facilitate the doctrine of reasonableness. The doctrine of reasonableness
is a bigger phenomenon because the public interest is also involved to
evaluate the reasonableness. The public interest is not necessarily to
take the interest of individual but have the public and society. The public
interest is also to be considered where the national interest is also
embodied.      When    the   convenience     of public to be   taken   into
consideration, the national interest for economic growth of the country
is equally to be balanced. If the nation’s interest is taken into
consideration, the public interest would be subdued. Be that as it may,
in the instant case it has to be seen whether the two factors, as
discussed above, are quietly available to issue order under Section 115
of the Act, 1988.
25.           It is the contention of the learned Senior Advocate for the
petitioners that they are facing difficulties to go to school, market and
hospital due to plying of the multi axle vehicles. At the same time, MCL
also requires carriage of multi axle vehicles to carry more quantity of
coal to improve the economic growth of the country. Petitioner being
owner of such multi axle vehicles have also got right to profession to
maintain their livelihood. So, the requirement of all these stake holders,
who used the road, have to balance well keeping the national interest
which is above all the interest of individual.

                                    - 21 -
26.          Next item comes about the nature of road. To ascertain the
condition of the road, a Multi Technical Committee was formed by order
of this Court and it had submitted its report to this Court. The report of
the said Committee has been divided into two parts. The first part is
signed by the Engineer and they have observed that multi axle vehicles
can ply on this road but the regular maintenance of the road is needed
at the instance of MCL and duly ensured by the district administration
for its sustainability. Their report shows that they have considered the
technical parameters showing feasibility of plying of multi axle vehicles.
On the other hand, second part of the report of the technical committee
duly constituted by Advocates of this Court shows that until the
condition of the road improved, multi axle vehicle should not be allowed
to ply. Finally, the Advocates’ Committee opined that till the road
conditions are not improved, the multi axle vehicles should not be
allowed to ply but if at all for the larger interest of the mines, the same
are required to operate, may be operated under the suitable control or
supervision. Since the report has been divided between the Engineers
and the Advocates, who consist of Technical Committee, the report has
no any significance except the technical parameters are filtered to opine
on the road condition. But perusal of the same, it appears that the
Technical Committee has visited the spot on 24th to 26th February, 2017.
It appears that the road has got 7 metre average width and there is no
critical curve. However, from the pleadings and report, it appears that
the road requires further development and MCL is committed to improve
the condition of the road by releasing the fund. It is reported that the

                                           - 22 -
Executive Engineer of the concerned Divisions has found the coal
corridor to be completed for which Rs.3.98 crore has been sanctioned
and tender process has been on. So, it is not a fact that road condition
is so bad to put full restriction on plying of multi axle vehicle.
27.          The observation of this Court made in W.P.(C) No.11744 of
2012 can be taken into consideration as this Court was considering the
similar issue in the district of Sundergarh. In paragraph-8 of the said
order, their Lordships have observed in the following manner:
             “8.......... Further till completion of the aforesaid 4 lane road,
             the MCL shall take all necessary steps to repair the existing
             road properly. As there is heavy traffic problems for which local
             people at large of the nearby villages are suffering and they
             find it difficult to attend hospitals, district offices, courts,
             schools and colleges due to blockage, for this purpose we direct
             O.P.No.2 to conduct a meeting with the High Officials of the
             MCL and choose and fix the suitable hours to ply the coal
             loaded vehicles of the MCL or the contractors engaged by it for
             transporting the coal, which will not cause much problems to
             the     public    at    large    and   direct  the    MCL/Vehicles
             Operators/Contractors not to use the vehicle at the restricted
             hours. The O.P. No.2 must see that the said transport vehicles
             are running without affecting the use of the road by the general
             public and conditions may be imposed not to create air and
             water pollution at the time of transportation of minerals. If
             there will be any violation to those conditions, stringent action
             shall be taken against such erring persons(s).”
             The above order was passed on 16.07.2012. Since the road
condition has been improved in the meantime, further improvement is
only required keeping in view the socio-economic safeguards of the local
people. Thus, the balance between the development of economic of
nation and the need of the people using such road should be struck
down to arrive at a decision by the Administrative Authority.
28.          No doubt, Section 115 of the Act, 1988 is also considered by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M.C. Mehta –V- Union of

                                         - 23 -
India and others; (1997) 8 SCC 770 and at paragraph-3 of the said
judgment, Their Lordships have observed in the following manner:
             “3.In our opinion, the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act,
             1988, in addition to the provisions in the existing laws, for
             example, the Police Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure,
             confer ample powers on the authorities to take the
             necessary steps to control and regular road traffic and to
             suspend/cancel the registration or permit of a motor vehicle
             if it poses a threat or hazard to public safety. It need hardly
             be added that the claim of any right by an individual or
             even a few persons cannot override and must be
             subordinate to the large public interest and this is how all
             provisions conferring any individual right have to be
             construed........”
29.          Recently, the road safety is taken the top priority as the
accidents have been increasing on the road due to multi vehicular
movements, careless driving, condition of the road becoming deplorable
due to lack of maintenance and untimely completion of the projects and
increase of commuters on the road. Therefore, the Hon’ble Supreme
Court laid stress on the Road safety. This aspect has been highlighted by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of S.Rajaseekaran –V- Union
of India and others (Writ Petition (Civil) No.295 of 2012)
disposed of on 30.11.2017.
             The aforesaid view of the Hon’ble Supreme Court must be
kept in view while passing the order under Section 115 of the Act, 1988.
30.          In terms of the above discussion, this Court is of the view
that the restrictions must be imposed basing on the doctrine of
reasonableness and public safety qua the national interest for economic
growth of the country. Therefore, the restrictions should be reasonable
which would cater to the need of public and multi axel vehicle owners to
use the road. The point is answered accordingly.

                                    - 24 -
31.         CONCLUSION
            It is prayed in W.P.(C) No.19933 of 2016 to issue writ of
Mandamus to declare the road in question as no plying zone/no traffic
zone for multi axle vehicles and further it is prayed to direct the
opposite parties to issue restrictions/prohibitions on plying of multi axle
vehicles in the aforesaid writ petition in terms of Annexure-10. At the
same time, it is prayed in W.P.(C) No.19266 of 2015 to quash the letter
dated 19.10.2015 putting no restriction on plying of multi axle vehicles.
32.         In view of the aforesaid analysis, this Court is of the view
that the interest of the petitioners and opposite party no.5 in W.P.(C)
No.19933 of 2016 must be balanced by issuing appropriate order by
opposite party no.3-Collector in both the writ petitions containing certain
suitable conditions while the attention is equally to be given to the
condition of road in question and its safety for commutation of all
including public. Therefore, this Court direct as under:
A.          The road from Bankibahal to Sundergarh must be widened
by opposite party no.4-MCL in both the writ petitions after discussing
with the State Government for full fledged coal corridor as per the
direction of this Court in W.P.(C) No.11744 of 2012 within a period of
two months from the date of this judgment and the work must be
completed by the end of 2018 on war footing basis. It is made clear that
MCL would make allotment of amount for such work in addition to
money already deposited;

                                     - 25 -
B.            The MCL would maintain the existing road directly by its own
machinery on every three months and any sort of deficiency in service
would be accountable in judicial side; and
C.            Till the above directions are complied, the opposite party
no.3-Collector in both the writ petitions would issue an order under
Section 115 of the Act, 1988 by putting appropriate restrictions for
plying of class of vehicles within a period of two months from today and
one of the conditions should be that the multi axle vehicles would only
ply from 11 PM to 6 AM and keep vigil over the movement of other
vehicles to avoid any accident during such time.
              In addition to these directions, the Collector, Sundergarh,
opposite party no.3 in both the writ petitions would also keep in mind
the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of S.
Rajaseekaran –V- Union of India and others decided on 30.11.2017
while passing the order as directed above.
              Both the writ petitions are disposed of accordingly.
                                                 …....………………………
