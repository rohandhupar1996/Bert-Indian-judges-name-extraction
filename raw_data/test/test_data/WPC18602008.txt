                                               JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                                     Heard Mr. A.B. Choudhury, the learned Senior Counsel for the
                 petitioners in the            WP(C) No.1860/2008. The petitioners in the WP(C)
                 No.3523/2008 are represented by the learned Counsel Mr. J.I. Borbhuiya. The
                 submission on behalf of the petitioners in the WP(C) No.2689/2008 is advanced
                 by Dr. B. Ahmed, the learned Counsel. Mr. R. De, the learned advocate
                 represents the petitioners in the WP(C) No.1773/2008, WP(C) No.1693/2008 and
                 WP(C) No.3712 respectively. But the advocates are absent for the petitioners in
                 the WP(C) No.2253/2008 and WP(C) No.1771/2008 although their names are
                 shown in the cause list. The departmental authorities are represented by the
                 learned Counsel Mr. S.K. Talukdar and Mr. P. Hazarika. The selected candidates
                 were arrayed as respondents in the WP(C) No.3523/2008 and newspaper notice
                 was also published for them to appear in the proceeding but there is no
                 representation from their side.
                 2.                  The process of selection and appointment to 464 posts of
                 surveillance workers (Grade-III post) under the Directorate of Health Services,
                 Assam, is under challenge in these proceedings. Some of the petitioners were
                 engaged earlier as DDT sprayers (Grade-IV post) and also as surveillance
                 workers under the Malaria Eradication Programme and these seasonal workers
                 claim weightage for their experience, in the impugned recruitment. The basic
                 contention of the petitioners is that district wise selection should have been
                 undertaken for the vacancies                in each district and according to them, the
                 centralized selection made by the Director, is contrary to the applicable norms.
                 3.                 The specific contention of the petitioners             in the WP(C)
                 No.3523/2008 is that merit was ignored and candidates with lower score than
WP(C) No.1860/2008, WP(C) No.3523/2008, WP(C) No.2689/2008, WP(C) No.1773/2008
WP(C) No.3712/2009WP(C) No.2253/2008 WP(C) No.1771/2008                                     Page 31 of 41

                                                                     32
                 the petitioners were appointed. The second plea of this group is that although 30
                 was the pass mark for the written test, many who had secured the threshold
                 mark, were not called to appear in the viva voce test.
                 4.                  The bona fide of the selection process is questioned in the WP(C)
                 No.3712/2009 by projecting that even before the select list was published in the
                 newspaper on 22.4.2008, a number of selected candidates reported for joining in
                 the Hailakandi District but after they submitted their joining reports, they were
                 deputed for duty in other districts because of which the service of the appointed
                 surveillance workers was not available in the Hailakandi district.
                 5.                  In order to project that selection was manipulated by the
                 Members of the Selection Committee, the petitioners rely on the Chief Minister’s
                 Vigilance Cell Case No.2/2015 registered on 30.4.2015 against some officials of
                 the Health Directorate to contend that since several fake appointments were
                 made in the Jorhat and Lakhimpur districts, the present recruitment process is
                 also clouded.
                 6.1                 On the other hand, Mr. S.K. Talukdar, the learned Counsel for the
                 Health Department submits that the selection was made on merit and in order to
                 show that recruitment was made bona fide, the departmental lawyer projects
                 that the written examination was conducted by the examiners of the Dibrugarh
                 University, who had set the question papers and also evaluated the answers
                 scripts. Therefore it is argued that manipulation of the selection by the official
                 respondents, is not at all possible.
                 6.2.                Referring to the legal provisions for recruitment of surveillance
                 workers, Mr. Talukdar submits that centralized recruitment is envisaged under
                 the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme Service Order, 2006 and district
                 wise selection is not prescribed by the service guidelines.
                 6.3                 The departmental lawyer submits that the petitioners have
                 structured their case on wrong premises by comparison of marks for dissimilar
                 categories and he produces the selection records to project that only the most
                 meritorious performers in each category was selected.

                                                                     33
                 6.4.                Mr. Talukdar further submits that the selection and recruitment
                 was made through a transparent and bona fide process involving the Dibrugarh
                 University and selection was made on merit and he argues that the contention
                 made to the contrary by the petitioners are entirely based on surmises and
                 conjectures.
                 7.                  Under the erstwhile National Malaria Eradication Programme of
                 the Central Government, the posts of surveillance             workers, spray workers,
                 vaccinators, field workers and superior field workers were created and these staff
                 were engaged for implementation of the Malaria Eradication Programme, which is
                 now re-named as the the National Vector Borne (NE) Disease Control Programme
                 (hereinafter referred to as “the Disease Control Programme”). The surveillance
                 workers under the Disease Control Programme are expected to keep vigil for
                 Vector Borne Diseases in their jurisdictional area and also educate people on
                 how malaria can be avoided.
                 8.                  The process of recruitment for the vacancies of surveillance
                 workers was started in the year 2005 but noticing the anomalies in the selection
                 process, the process was cancelled and the Government ordered for fresh
                 advertisement on 4.9.2006, for de novo selection. Thereafter advertisement was
                 issued on 3.2.2007 for the 464 posts of surveillance workers, by the Director of
                 Health Services and the petitioners offered their candidatures. A two stage
                 selection process with written test of 100 marks and viva voce with 25 marks,
                 was made the basis of selection.
                 9.                 Some of the candidates who had participated in the abandoned
                 selection process initiated in the year 2005, challenged the cancellation order and
                 also the fresh process of selection. Another group claimed weightage for their
                 experience as seasonal workers in the Malaria Eradication Programmes.
                 Eventually a bunch of writ petition with the lead case i.e. WP(C) No.5162/2006
                 (Bhaban Mohan and another vs. State of Assam and others) was disposed of on
                 23.2.2007 whereby this Court directed the State, to specify the extent of
                 preference/weightage to be given to the DDT sprayers, in the process of
                 selection of field workers/superior field workers, in pursuant to the advertisement

                 dated 29.9.2006.
                 10.                 Following       the     selection       process initiated  through    the
                 advertisement dated 3.2.2007, the candidates appeared in the written test on
                 26.8.2007 at Guwahati and thereafter the viva voce was conducted in the ratio of
                 3:1 i.e. 3 candidates for each vacancy and the Roll Numbers of the selected
                 candidates was hung up in the Director’s office on 11.4.2008 but this List was
                 published in the newspaper only on 22.4.2008.
                 11.                 The petitioners were unsuccessful and they challenge the legality
                 of the recruitment by contending that centralized selection is illegal and the
                 recruitment of surveillance workers must be made through localized selection
                 process in each district. In support of such contention, the petitioners’ Counsel
                 rely on the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme Service Order, 2006
                 (hereinafter referred to as “the Service Order 2006”); the Assam District Wise
                 Population Pattern Reflection In service (In Class III and Class IV Posts) Act,
                 1994 (hereinafter referred to as “the District Wise Population Act 1994”) and also
                 the Assam Public Services (Direct Recruitment to Class-III and Class-IV Posts)
                 Rules, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as “the Recruitment Rules 1997”) to argue
                 that centralized selection is not envisaged for the post of surveillance workers
                 and the recruitment must be made by a District Selection Board in each district.
                 12.                 The cadre strength of surveillance workers is notified as 1697 in
                 the Service Order 2006 and the Director of Health Services is made the
                 “appointing authority” under Section 2(a). A “District Selection Board” under
                 Section 2(b) is envisaged for direct recruitment to Grade-III posts and the
                 process of recruitment is specified under Section 6 of the Service Order 2006.
                 Responsibility for assessing the available vacancies and making the selection is
                 entrusted to the “appointing authority” by Section 6 of the Service Order 2006
                 and composition of the four Member Selection Board headed by the Director of
                 Health Services, is given in Section 11 of the Service Order 2006. Besides the
                 Director, other three Members of the Selection Board are Guwahati based officers
                 and conspicuously Section 11 doesn’t provide for a member from the District
                 Health authorities.

                                                                     35
                 13.                 But there appears to be some contradiction vis-à-vis the “Selection
                 Board” specified in Section 11 with the “Board” as defined under Section 2(b) of
                 the Service Order 2006 since the definition section envisages a “District Selection
                 Board”. However if one examines the method of recruitment prescribed under
                 Section 6 as well as the composition of the “Selection Board” given under Section
                 11 coupled with the fact that the Director of Health Services is the “appointing
                 authority” under Section 2(a), it is difficult to comprehend and reconcile the
                 concept of District wise selection for the post of surveillance workers, under the
                 Service Order 2006, as is canvassed by the petitioners.
                 14.                 At this stage, it would be necessary to notice the impact of the
                 Recruitment Rules 1997 and the District Wise Population Act 1994 since these
                 two enactments are pressed home by the learned lawyers to argue for district
                 wise selection. Direct recruitment to Class-III and Class-IV posts are regulated
                 under the District Wise Population Act 1994 and the “principles of appointments”
                 stipulated under Section 4 makes it absolutely clear that qualification and
                 standard can’t be compromised, to ensure the reflection of the population
                 pattern of the district, in the matter of recruitment. Thus upon proper analysis
                 and interpretation it can be concluded safely that the legislative intent was not to
                 over-emphasize the population pattern in the district and the merit of the
                 candidates must get precedence because of the “principle of appointment”,
                 stipulated by the District Wise Population Act 1994.
                 15.                 In so far as the Recruitment Rules 1997 is concerned, the Rules
                 come into play only when Service Rules/Executive Orders are absent and the
                 Rules are not to be applied universally for all recruitments because of the bar of
                 Rule 3(2)(i) in those situations, where recruitment is governed by Service
                 Rules/Executive Orders. In view of the limited scope for application of the
                 Recruitment Rules as restricted by Rule 3, and since Executive Orders in the
                 shape of the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme Service Order, 2006
                 govern the recruitment process of surveillance workers, this Court of the firm
                 view that the concept of district wise selection for such posts can’t be imported,
WP(C) No.1860/2008, WP(C) No.3523/2008, WP(C) No.2689/2008, WP(C) No.1773/2008

                                                                     36
                 on the strength of the District Wise Population Act 1994 and the Recruitment
                 Rules 1997. Thus the centralized process of recruitment as specified under
                 Section 11 of the Service Order 2006, is found to be consistent with the legal
                 provisions. On the basis of the above discussion in the preceding paragraphs, I
                 hold that centralized process is the legal mode of recruitment for the post of
                 surveillance workers.
                 16.                Now the impact of the common judgment of this Court in the
                 WP(C) NO.5162/2006 Bhaben Mohan and other group cases has to be assessed.
                 Here the High Court was considering the process of appointment to a number of
                 posts such as field workers, superior field workers, surveillance workers,
                 laboratory technicians, laboratory assistants, drivers etc. under the Health and
                 Family Welfare (A) Department. But although those writ petitioners were from
                 different     categories,      the     eventual      Court    direction was for  considering
                 preference/weightage only for the posts of field workers/superior field workers.
                 In fact the specific direction given in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 23.2.2007
                 doesn’t refer to the process of appointment for the post of surveillance workers.
                 Therefore I hold that preference/weightage can’t be claimed for the post of
                 surveillance workers, on the strength of the judgment in Bhaben Mohan (supra).
                 17.                 The next issue to be considered is whether any illegality was
                 committed in the centralized recruitment process since the unsuccessful
                 candidates argue that the selection was not made on merit. The relevant
                 averments alleging unmerited selection is available in the WP(C) No.3523/2008
                 and therefore the merit of these averments have to be assessed. On 7.11.2007
                 the Selection Committee prescribed 30 as the pass mark in the written test and
                 the petitioners 11 – 47 in the WP(C) No.3523/2008 contend that although they
                 had secured 30 or more in the written segment, they were not called for the viva
                 voce test. But on 7.11.2007 itself, the same committee passed the resolution
                 No.7, fixing the 1:3 ratio or in other words they resolved to call 3 times the
                 number of vacancies, for the viva voce test. The selection record shows that the
                 requisite 1:3 ratio figure was reached at a much higher cut off marks. For
                 instance for the general category male candidates, the cut off mark was 71%
                 and for the MOBC male category the cut off mark was 69%, in the written test.
WP(C) No.1860/2008, WP(C) No.3523/2008, WP(C) No.2689/2008, WP(C) No.1773/2008
WP(C) No.3712/2009WP(C) No.2253/2008 WP(C) No.1771/2008                                       Page 36 of 41

                                                                     37
                 Therefore only those who scored high marks and who came within the zone of
                 consideration (in the ratio of 1:3), were called for the viva voce test and this is
                 how many candidates who may have secured the pass mark of 30, were
                 overlooked for the viva voce segment. But when we examine the issue in the
                 context of the 1:3 ratio as was resolved on 7.11.2007 by the selection
                 committee, the exclusion of some for the viva voce test who may have secured
                 the pass mark of 30, can’t be said to be illogical.
                 18.                To project unmerited selection, averments are made in paragraph
                 21, 22 & 23 of the WP(C) No.3523/2008 where it is alleged that candidates with
                 lesser marks were selected. But it appears that the comparison of marks is made
                 amongst unequals of different categories and that is how, incorrect projection is
                 made by the petitioners. For instance, the marks of the 4 general category male
                 candidates are reflected in paragraph 16, to compare them with marks secured
                 by the selected female candidates, whose names are reflected in the next
                 paragraph. Similarly the 6th petitioner is projected as an OBC category candidate
                 and her marks are compared with selected female candidate of OBC category.
                 Likewise in the ST(P) category, the case of 5th petitioner is highlighted, but here
                 the comparison is made with selected female candidates of ST(P) category. In
                 the present selection exercise, reservation for OBC, ST, SC category to the extent
                 of 49% of the total vacancies was already earmarked. But within the reserved
                 and open categories, horizontal reservation for woman (30%) and disabled
                 category was also envisaged and selection was made by applying the criteria of
                 both vertical and horizontal reservation. Therefore the comparison of marks of a
                 male in the general category with the female candidate in the same category,
                 doesn’t reflect the selection of a lesser merited person. Since horizontal
                 reservation for woman to the extent of 30% was prescribed, a female candidate
                 with lesser score certainly has a greater chance for recruitment, if compared with
                 a male candidate of the same category. Thus comparison of marks of male
                 candidates in the open and ST category, with female candidates of these two
                 categories do not establish unmerited selection, because of horizontal reservation
                 prescribed for woman candidates. So far as the 6th petitioner Binapani Roy is
                 concerned, although she is projected to be of the OBC category, she was

                                                                     38
                 considered as a general category candidate as can be seen from the selection
                 records and therefore comparison of her marks with selected female candidate of
                 OBC category can’t be made the basis for conclusion that unmerited selection
                 was made by the authorities.
                 19.                 The petitioner refer to the registration of the Chief Minister’s
                 Vigilance Cell Case No.2/2015 against the then Director of Health who was the
                 Chairman of the selection board. A reading of the FIR produced by the
                 petitioners’ counsel shows that the allegation therein relates to the issuance of
                 fake appointment orders without advertisement or selection, to appoint
                 pharmacists, vaccinators, laboratory injector, BCG technician, surveillance
                 workers, ward boys, dressers, drivers etc. in the Jorhat and Lakhimpur districts
                 and these allegations may have no connection with the recruitment process
                 impugned here. A prima facie reading of this FIR doesn’t suggests that this
                 criminal case was registered in connection with the appointments of 464
                 surveillance workers in pursuant to the advertisement dated 3.2.2007 and
                 therefore I do not find any basis to draw any negative inference for this selection
                 process, on the basis of that criminal case.
                 20.                Before parting with the records, another point raised by the
                 petitioners is required to be considered. It appears that the Roll numbers of the
                 selected candidates was published in the newspapers only on 22.4.2008 but
                 some of the selected candidates reported for joining 2/3 days before the
                 newspaper advertisement was issued. But it appears from the selection records
                 produced by the departmental lawyer that the select list was prepared on
                 9.4.2008 and a letter was sent on 11.4.2008 to the Director of information and
                 public information, to publish the select list in three leading daily newspapers of
                 the State. It further appears that the select list was pasted in the Notice Board of
                 the Director’s office on 11.4.2008 and that is how a few successful candidates
                 could collect the appointment letters before the newspaper publication of the
                 select list on 22.4.2008. The late publication in the newspaper can best be
                 explained by the Director of Information and Publicity and on this count, no
                 illegality can be assumed as there is a logical explanation for early reporting by
                 few selected candidates. Thus in my perception, the appointment followed the
WP(C) No.1860/2008, WP(C) No.3523/2008, WP(C) No.2689/2008, WP(C) No.1773/2008
WP(C) No.3712/2009WP(C) No.2253/2008 WP(C) No.1771/2008                               Page 38 of 41

                                                                     39
                 select list and not vice versa, as is suggested by the petitioners.
                 21.                 From the selection records produced in Court by the departmental
                 lawyer, it appears that the cut off mark for male and female candidates in any
                 category is not the same because 30% posts were reserved for woman. The
                 entire selection records were made available for perusal by the lawyers for the
                 unsuccessful petitioners and although they had ample time to examine the
                 records, they failed to bring forth a single instance of a lesser merited candidate
                 securing appointment on the strength of the impugned selection process.
                 Moreover the Dibrugarh University had conducted the written examination and
                 no allegation is made against the evaluation process. Thus inescapable
                 conclusion must be drawn that the selection was made on merit.
                 22.                 Moreover since centralized recruitment was envisaged under the
                 Service Order 2006, the non-selection of expected number of candidates from a
                 given district can’t by itself make the process illegal. While on this point, since a
                 specific plea was made in respect of the vacancies in Hailakandi district the court
                 is informed that 46 posts of surveillance workers is sanctioned for Hailakandi
                 district and at present 29 persons are working in that district. But the 12 persons
                 appointed in year 2008 in Hailakandi District are missing but they are reportedly
                 posted in Nalbari/Nagaon/Barpeta and Kamrup, which are their home districts.
                 Such information is obtained by the petitioners in the WP(C) No.3712/2009
                 through their RTI application and the information reflects that as on 22.1.2009 all
                 12 persons are posted in the home districts and more importantly, not in their
                 respective place of appointment in Hailakandi district. The deployment of
                 surveillance workers can be made in exigencies of service but at the same time,
                 it is the responsibility of the appointing authority to ensure that no undue favour
                 is shown to any appointee. Such discriminatory postings send a wrong signal to
                 those who expect fair treatment from the hands of the State authorities and in
                 fact this is one factor because of which the bona fide of the appointing authority
                 is suspected by the unsuccessful candidates. Therefore this aspect must be
                 appropriately addressed by the authorities to ensure that no special favour is
                 shown in posting of the surveillance workers to deny the appointee’s service at
                 the place, where they were originally appointed. Hence necessary re-

                 consideration on the place of posting of the 12 appointees of Hailakandi district is
                 ordered to be made by the Director within 4 weeks of receipt of this order. It is
                 ordered accordingly.
                 23.                 The recruitment process for the surveillance workers was initiated
                 through advertisement of the vacancies and the method of selection prescribed
                 by the Service Order 2006 was followed by the authorities. The norms of
                 selection were decided beforehand and only after evaluation of the merit of the
                 candidates, appointments were given by notifying the select list. The process in
                 my perception was fair and transparent and no legal infirmity is seen with the
                 exercise undertaken by the respondents.
                 24.                 In view of the above decision, I hold that selection was made on
                 merit as per law and the petitioners are disentitled to any relief and therefore
                 these cases are disposed of accordingly. No cost.
