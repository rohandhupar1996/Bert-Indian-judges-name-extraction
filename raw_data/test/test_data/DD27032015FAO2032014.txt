PRESENT :
                         THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE D.DASH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of hearing : 21.01.2015                        :        Date of judgment: 27.03.2015
                  This appeal has been filed challenging an order passed by
the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Champua in CMA No. 18 of
2013, in the matter of a petition under order 39, rules 1 and 2 read
with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
                  By the said order the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division)
has rejected the petition filed by the appellants in their suit as
plaintiffs-petitioners           for     issuance         of    a    temporary          injunction
restraining the defendant-opposite parties from interfering with their

                                    -2-
peaceful possession and from evicting them by demolishing any
structure on it till disposal of the suit.
2.            The case of the Appellants is that :-
              MAA JAGANAJANI             Temple is situated in village
Unchabali under the jurisdiction of Bamebari Police Station in the
district of Keonjhar. Appellant no.1 is the deity and one of its devotees
has joined as appellant no.2. Appellant no.3 is the charitable trust,
which maintains the temple and looks after the affairs of the deity.
Petitioner nos. 4 and 5 have also been joined as appellants.
              It is stated that about 70 years back one Gana Mahakud
started worshiping the deity under a thatched house which was
previously underneath a nearby banyan tree standing over Khata
No.172, Plot No.28, in the said village. It is stated that the deity was
there since 100 years and the actual installation of the deity has been
lost in antiquity. The thatched house is popularly known as “Maa
Jagatjanani Temple” and the area upon which trust complex exists is
measuring about five        acres better described in Schedule-A of the
plaint with sketch map in Schedule-B. It is stated that in course of
time number of devotees thronged to that place and that thatched
house was converted into a temple initially running under an
unregistered charitable public trust which was established and run
by MAHAKUD family as well as general public and devotees of Maa
Jagatjanani since 1980 and it has been registered on 08.12.2011. The

                                   -3-
said trust is imparting/propagating/professing a sense of spiritual
worshiping     of  Adishakti    amongst    it’s devotees   without    any
discrimination of cast, creed and religion. Besides, rendering services
to the people of the locality, in course of time there has been
construction of some buildings and the place attracts a number of
tourists.
             It is alleged that the local administration being politically
motivated have hatched out an evil design to demolish the temple and
other structures which have come up nearby. So apprehending the
demolition, the suit has come to be filed claiming the relief of
declaration that the plaintiff has perfected title by adverse possession
and challenging the initiation of a proceeding under OPLE Act and the
order of eviction passed therein as without jurisdiction with further
prayer for permanent injunction.
             The prayer of temporary injunction has also been made
as stated above.
3.           The respondents denied worship of the deity as averred in
the plaint and the petition filed by the appellants. It is stated that
actual encroacher is one Mr. Sanatan Mahakud and he is pretending
to be the devotee to grab the Government land which is of great value.
All those facts stated in the plaint as regards the existence of the deity
since time immemorial as well as the development being carried out
from time to time are denied. It is stated that the Revenue Inspector,

                                  -4-
Joda submitted a report regarding the illegal possession of the suit
land by the appellants as encroachers. So, the Tahasildar, Barbil
initiated the proceedings under the Odisha Prevention of Land
Encroachment Act, 1972 to evict the appellant from the suit land. The
temple and the trust complex are said to have come up recently. It is
stated that the proceeding has been initiated in order to protect the
vast patch of valuable Government land which stands recorded as
Abad Ajogya Anabadi in Government Khata with kissam under
(Parbat-II) and it is coming within mining lease area containing huge
mineral deposits. So it is said that the encroachment is highly
objectionable. The encroachment is said to have been made by one
Mr. Sanatan Mahakud since 2008-09 only for the purpose of carrying
out illegal mining activity and he being an affluent person with high
political  connection   has  unauthorisedly     constructed a    palatial
building and in the pretext of the worship of the so called deity has
initiated the suit through the plaintiff with assigned status solely with
a malafide intention of grabbing the valuable government land for the
purpose of carrying out the illegal mining activity etc.
4.           It is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants
that in view of the long, continuous and uninterrupted possession of
the suit land measuring about five acres, which has in course of time
become a place of attraction for number of devotees and tourists with
so many buildings coming up there, the appellants have a prima facie

                                   -5-
case. According to him, the balance of convenience leans in favour of
continuance of such structures put up in course of time with huge
investment and their protection till disposal of the suit, where the
claim of right, title interest of the appellants as claimed would be
decided. It is further submitted that in case of eviction and demolition
of structure standing over the suit land, the plaintiffs will sustain
irreparable loss and in the process whatever would be lost will go
uncompensated.
             It is the next submission that the trial court has found a
prima facie case in favour of the appellants. However, it erred in law
by holding that no such temporary injunction can be granted/issued
against the true owner i.e. the State and the court below according to
him has taken an erroneous view that provisions of section 41(b) of
the Specific Relief Act stands as a bar for grant of injunction. Thus, he
contends that the order of rejection of the prayer of temporary
injunction is unsustainable in the eye of law and is liable to be set
aside. He therefore, urges for grant of temporary injunction as prayed
for.
5.           Learned counsel for the State while refuting the above
submission, with vehemence submits that all such facts about the
existence of the deity from time immemorial have been stated with the
evil purpose of grabbing the valuable Government land and carrying
out illegal mining activity. He further submits that the proceedings

                                  -6-
have been initiated in order to protect vast patch of land having rich
mineral deposits and the encroacher Mr. Sanatan Mahakud has in
the name of the deity began the activity of encroachment since 2008-
2009 for running the business illegally and has forcibly constructed
building only to thwart the eviction by taking all those pleas. It is also
submitted by him that the appellant no.4 is none other than the son
of Mr. Sanatan Mahakud, when against Mr. Sanatan Mahakud in the
year 2011-12 an encroachment case was initiated and order of
eviction was passed and that was in respect of land measuring
Ac.1.200 decimals . The land in question comes under the lease hold
area of M/s. ESSEL Mining and now Mr Sanatan Mahakud being a
member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly has got the suit filed with
malafide intention of grabbing the valuable Government land in
carrying out illegal mining activity. According to him, such type of
cases where there is encroachment of highly objectionable land of vast
tract and then with the money and muscle power such unauthorized
possession is sought to be protected, the persons with such illegal
activities to their credit are not be protected by grant of temporary
injunction in respect of their possession as claimed as the same is
against public interest resulting huge loss of revenue and would send
wrong message to the society that persons with wealth and power, are
above the law. He also contends that it would encourage illegal
activity as above not only causing loss to the State Exchequer but also

                                   -7-
ultimately to the suffering of public at large. Therefore, he contends
that the order passed by the trial court is perfectly legal and justified
and the appeal is liable to be dismissed being devoid of merit.
6.            A careful reading of the order, goes to show that the trial
court has taken a view that since the appellants claim to have
perfected title over the suit land by adverse possession which is
required to be decided finally in the suit, there exists a prima facie
case.
              Next so far as the irreparable injury is concerned, it has
been held that no injunction can be issued against the true owner.
Lastly coming to the balance of convenience, the court below has held
it to be not leaning more in favour of the appellants in view of the bar
contained under section 41(b) of the Specific Relief Act.
7.            On the rival case set up by the appellants as well as the
State thus it appears that the appellants claim title over this entire
suit land measuring quite huge extent Ac.5.00 dec. out of an area
Ac.54.065 dec. under one plot. The kisam of the land is ‘Parbat’ which
further appears to have been with a definite purpose has been
suppressed to be mentioned both in the schedule of land as described
in the plaint and thereafter wherever it is so described, the land
shown to be bounded by the land of Mr. Sanatan Mahakud, the father
of the appellant no.4 on its north, mines on its south, village
boundary on its east and again mines on its west. This provide great

                                  -8-
support to the submission of the learned counsel for the State that
Mr. Sanatan Mahakud has the nexus when son forming a trust claims
to be in possession of quite large extent of government land inside
jungle. It further appears that the land is within the mining lease
area. The case of the State is that the actual encroacher is Mr.
Sanatan Mahakud, the father of the appellant no.4 and all these are
cock and bull stories for the purpose. It is further stated that
encroaching this Government land illegal mining business is going on
and that Mr. Sanatan Mahakud being affluent person with political
connection has constructed these buildings in the pretext of
worshipping the deity only with a mala fide intention of grabbing the
valuable Government land and with a view to carry out the illegal
mining activity as the land is having potential mineral deposits. It is
further stated that as against Mr. Sanatan Mahakud there was an
encroachment proceeding in the year 2011-12 and that is also
concerning a portion of Ac.1.200 dec. of land from this very Plot
No.28. It is also the case of the State that the temple constructed is
run by Mr. Sanatan Mahakud and other things as stated in the plaint
are all paper works and the land is coming in the lease-hold area
covered under a mining lease. The temple and all other constructions
are said to have been made illegally. The purpose of initiating the
proceeding for eviction is to save the valuable Government land and
prevent the theft of minerals under the leadership of Mr. Sanatan

                                 -9-
Mahakud, who is presently a Member of the Odisha Legislative
Assembly. It has been stated in the written note of submission that
the activities are run by Mr. Sanatan Mahakud and now a case is
projected just to continue with such illegal possession as long as
possible and earn money illegally by doing such illegal act being a law
maker being representative of the people and repository of public
faith.
8.            Though just averments have been made in the plaint with
regard to long, continuous and uninterrupted possession, no such
documentary evidence is forthcoming from the custody of the
appellants. So, prima facie the appellants’ possession is nothing but
as that of mere encroacher. Simply because of the constructions
made, it cannot be inferred for a moment that such possession has
been for last so many years. Cumulatively viewing the pleadings,
prima facie the move appears to be highly mischievous. First of all, it
is seen that    this is not the only encroachment and there is also
encroachment by the father of appellant no.4, which is now not
coming to the picture in this suit. The land, in question, is a part of
the lease hold area leased out for the purpose of mining activity. The
allegation remains that this encroachment is for the purpose of
facilitating theft of minerals by way of illegal extractions from the
nearby land.

                                  - 10 -
9.           It is the settled law that injunction cannot be issued
against the true owner. Even assuming that the appellants had been
in possession and are now continuing as such, their possession being
that of a trees passer, an injunction cannot be issued in favour of a
tress passer or a person who gained unlawful possession as against
the owner. The plaint though contains some averments to show
existence of deity since long, not a scrap of paper to that effect has
been filed. This is quite surprising and thus leading prima facie show
as to how beautifully and applying appropriate mind to the subject to
serve the purpose, the stories have been coined. Simply because huge
amount has been spent for construction of temple and other
structures for the devotees to come and stay is no excuse and that
being done without any authority or right, it has to be taken that it
was at the complete risk and peril of the encroacher. A person putting
up such constructions over land belonging to the State having so
done taking the risk without any authority has no right to seek
injunction. Such a move in putting up huge and beautiful structures
at huge expenses in the name of deity running temple if by sheer
show of money and muscle power, the Court cannot come to their
rescue by accepting the claim of issuance of injunction against the
true owner. It is not permissible for a person that totally violating the
provisions of law and blowing those to winds being in a position to put
up beautiful construction spending huge amount over the land of the

                                   - 11 -
State, the same can be pressed into service to protect the possession
by said person by seeking the relief of injunction. The time has come
that the Court should show them the door of exist at the earliest. It is
not a case of landless person encroaching the property for the
purpose of having a dwelling house or to do something to maintain
the family. The very case set up by the appellant appears to be wholly
against the public interest. The appellants in order to avoid that have
come up with the case that the public and devotees would be affected
by such dispossession. At this stage, it may be stated that we all are
governed by rule of law and simply because a move or activity which
is not as per that gets the support of some section of the public, the
Court is not under any obligation to accept their prayer if it is not in
accordance with law as in a legal proceeding voice of majority has no
place for consideration if it is not having the legal back up.
10.          It has been held in the case of Mahadov Savalaram
Shelke Vrs. Pune Municipal Corporation, 1995 (III) S.C.C. 33 that
in a suit for injunction the Court should enquire on an affidavit and
other materials placed before it to find strong prima facie case and
balance of convenience in favour of granting injunction otherwise
irreparable loss or damage would ensue to the plaintiff. It should also
be found out whether the plaintiff would be adequately compensated
by damages if injunction is not granted against the true owner at the
instance of person in unlawful possession. Public interest is therefore

                                 - 12 -
one of the material and relevant consideration in either exercising or
refusing to grant ad interim injunction.
11.          Learned counsel for the appellants in course of argument
has made a scathing remark showing relevant portion of the order
especially in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 which, according to him, finds
mention of decisions which cover different subjects. However, on
verification it is found that simply the citations with reference to
specific journal are wrongly stated. The court below as it appears has
not carefully corrected the order, which was its duty before delivery
and, therefore, the above mistakes have crept in. It is true that the
Presiding Officer cannot escape for the said mistake but that, itself, is
no ground to hold the impugned order as unsustainable in the eye of
law.
             Now, let us come to the decisions cited by the learned
counsel for the appellants which are K. Duriyendra and Ors. Vs.
State of Orissa and Ors., A.I.R. 1992 Orissa 297. This is a case
where it has been clearly held that section 41(3) of the Specific Relief
Act creates a bar for issuance of temporary injunction in favour of the
petitioners since the authority under the O.P.L.E. Act is not
subordinate to the Civil Court.       It has further been held that
injunction by exercise of inherent power under section 151 of the
Code of Civil Procedure cannot be granted and in view of the clear

                                  - 13 -
statutory bar, in the guise of ends of justice, the powers under section
151 of the Code cannot be invoked.
             The Court at the end perhaps has expressed a pious wish
for consideration of the claim of the petitioners by the authority under
the Act not to dispossess till decision of the Civil suit taking into
account the facts and circumstances of the case. The purpose of
citing the decision as it appears is to impress upon this Court that in
the present case the said course be adopted and it be accordingly
directed. To this, humbly I accord my disapproval. In a proceeding
under Order 39 Rules-1 and 2 of the Code such a power does no more
remain with the court to be exercised in directing any authority to
defer the taking over the possession of the land in question by
considering the move. On legal principle the decision what is states
does in no way stand to support and rather counter the move of the
appellants save and except the direction given therein at last.
             The next decision is in case of Government of Andhra
Pradesh Vrs. Thummala Krishan Rao and another, AIR 1982 SC
1081. The Hon’ble Court in that case have held that the summary
remedy for eviction under the Act is to be restored to by the
Government only against persons who are unauthorized occupations
of any land which is the property of the Government. If there is a bona
fide dispute regarding the title of the Government to any property, the
Government cannot take a unilateral decision in its own favour that

                                 - 14 -
the property belongs to it and on the basis of      such decision take
recourse to the summary remedy provided by section 6 for evicting
the person who is in possession of the property under a bona fide
claim or title. The summary remedy prescribed by Section 6 is not the
kind of legal process which is suited to an adjudication of complicated
questions of title. It has also been held therein that in view of the
claim of the petitioners about acquisition of title by adverse
possession which is to be decided in a properly constituted suit and
until the Government succeed in establishing its title of the property,
the respondents could not be evicted summarily. The fact and
circumstances of the present case are quite distinguishable. In the
cited case the long possession of the respondents since the time of
their predecessors-in-interest over those plots raised a genuine
dispute between them and the Government on the question of title,
especially viewing that the property admittedly belonged originally to
the family of Nawab from whom the respondents claimed to have
purchased. But here the facts are totally different. The appellants
claimed to have been in illegal possession for a long period by putting
up certain construction. So, the position that of the appellants here is
not as in case of the persons in the cited case where the parties were
claiming title through the erstwhile owner and accordingly were
asserting to have remained in possession. The other decisions cited is
State of Orissa Vrs. Daitari Sagy & Others, 2006(II) CLR-411. In

                                 - 15 -
that cited case, the plaintiff’s father was the recorded tenant in
possession as per the records of the last settlement. It is asserted to
have been incorrectly recorded in the name of the State, which being
not the case here, for the consideration. Therefore, the decisions cited
by the learned counsel for the appellants are of no help to the case of
the appellants for grant of temporary injunction.
             On the aforesaid discussion, this Court thus differing
with the court below finds no prima facie case in favour of the
appellants. Trespassers possession over the land so trespassed as
against the owner does not give rise to a prima facie case in a suit
between the tress passers and owners.
13.          Next   let us   come   to  the  question of    balance    of
convenience. The appellants having simply put up construction at
their risk over huge extent of valuable Government land having
mineral deposits cannot at all claim that the balance of convenience
leans in their favour to continue with such illegal activity and its
prima facie a continuing wrong. Rather in my considered view it leans
in favour of the respondents for total stoppage of such illegal activity
forthwith. In that view of the matter, the appellants approach to the
Court to favour them taking a view that they would be suffering from
irreparable loss by such action of eviction by the respondents has to
be immediately bulldozed as it runs wholly against the larger public

                                         - 16 -
 interest.          A person having sufficient funds in his hands by
constructing a temple over a piece of Government land in attracting
peoples to the place, in my considered view cannot thwart his eviction
on the ground that by such act irreparable loss would be cause to
him. Acceptance of such a plea would be amounting to encourage
lawlessness and to see that it prevails. Therefore, the prayer of the
appellants for grant of temporary injunction is devoid of merit. In view
of aforesaid discussion and reasons, the ultimate order which has
been impugned in the appeal is held as not liable to be set aside.
14.                 The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
                    No order as to cost.
                                                    …………………………
