PRESENT:
                     THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE D.DASH
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Date of hearing: 11.01.2017 : Date of judgment : 25.01.2017
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                In this appeal, the challenge is to the order dated
08.03.2016 passed by the learned State Education Tribunal in G.I.A.
No. Case No. 216 of 2013 holding the respondents who are the
teaching & non-teaching staff of Bharati High School, Kankili in the
district of Angul as being entitled to their salary component as per the
Grant-In-Aid Order, 1994 with effect from 01.06.1994.
                The parties hereinafter have been referred to as they have
been arraigned before the Tribunal.

                                  // 2 //
       2.    Facts essential for the purpose of this appeal may be
stated hereunder:-
             Bharati High School, Kankili in the district of Angul has
been established since the year 1987, followed by the recognition from
the Board of Secondary Education Orissa for opening of class VIII
during academic session 1988-89 and thereafter for class IX and X.
First batch of students of the school have appeared in the Annual High
School Examination in the year 1991. After coming into force of the
Grant-In-Aid Order, 1994, pursuant to the incorporation of the
provision of section 7-C for Orissa Education Act, 1969 by Orissa
Education Amendment Act, 1994, on being asked, the managing
committee of the school in accordance with the provision in the said
Order submitted the proposal to the Inspector for release of grant-in-
aid as per GIA Order 1994. Since no action was taken on that, it is
stated that several representations had been made before opposite
party no. 1 and 2. It is further stated that although some similarly
situated schools were sanctioned with the grant-in-aid in terms of GIA
Order, 1994, yet the case of the applicants who are the staffs of the
concerned school did not find favour with. However, after coming into
force of Grant-in-Aid Order, 2004 the appointment of the applicants
no. 1 to 9 were approved under GIA Order, 2004 and those of
applicant nos. 10 and 11 were approved under GIA Amendment Order,
2008.

                                      // 3 //
             The applicants then had filed GIA Case No. 108 of 2008.
However, without adjudication, the Tribunal had disposed of the case
for proper examination by the opposite parties. Finally the claim
having been rejected, the applicants moved the Tribunal again.
       3.    The opposite parties in their counter state that the claim
has been rejected basing on the report of opposite party no.2.
             The reason is that the first batch of students appeared in
Annual H.S.C. Exam. in the year 1991 and in the year 1991, 1992 and
1993 out of 40, 40 and 50 students, 10, 18 and 23 students have
passed out which falls below the State average. It is further stated that
the school is not fulfilling the eligibility criteria under GIA Order, 1994.
       4.    The Tribunal has negatived the objection raised by the
State and considering the claim of the applicants, in view of the
position of law set at rest by the decision of this Court has finally
passed the order which runs as under:-
                    “That, this Grant in Aid application is allowed on
             contest against the O.Ps, but without any costs. The O.P.
             Nos.1 and 3 are directed to notify the Institution of the
             applicants as an Aided Educational Institution as per
             Grant    in   Aid   Order,       1994  and  also   approve  the
             appointment of the applicants and release grant-in-aid in
             their favour as per their eligibility in accordance with the
             said   Grant     in  Aid    Order,    1994  together  with  the
             differential admissible salary component within a period of
             four months from the date of receipt of this order.”

                                  // 4 //
      5.    In this appeal, the following grounds have been raised in
support of the prayer of setting aside the order of the learned Tribunal
as above noted:-
            A. For that impugned order passed by the State Education
               Tribunal,   Orissa,    Bhubaneswar     is  unjust,  illegal
               contrary to the material available on record and liable
               to be set aside.
            B. For that the learned Tribunal failed to appreciate the
               facts and law involved in the list in its proper
               perspective.
            C. For that the learned Tribunal did not take into
               consideration the provision of Section 7-C(1) of the
               Orissa Education Act, 1969 which clearly states that
               the State Government shall within the limits of its
               economic capacity, set apart a sum of money annually
               for being given as grant-in-aid to Private Educational
               Institution in the State, which clearly reveals that the
               Government is not bound to provide grant-in-aid to any
               private     educational      institution    on     merely
               attaining/acquiring the eligibility.
            D. For that the learned Tribunal has also failed to
               appreciate the provisions under Section 7(C)(4) of the
               Orissa Education Act wherein it has been provided that
               notwithstanding anything contained in any law, rule
               executive order or any judgment, decree or order any
               Court, no grant-in-aid shall be paid and no payment
               towards salary costs or any other expenses shall be
               made to any private educational institution or for any
               post or to any person employed in any such institution
               after the commencement of the Orissa Education

                      // 5 //
   (Amendment) Act, 1994, except in accordance with an
   order or rule made under this Act. Grant-in-aid where
   admissible from such date as may be specified in that
   rule or order or from such date as may be specified in
   that rule or order or from such date as may be
   determined by the State Government.
E. For that the learned Tribunal also did not take into
   consideration the provisions of Section 7-D (ii) of the
   Orissa Education act, 1969 wherein it has been
   provided that the percentage of students passing the
   Annual and Supplementary examinations conducted by
   the Board of Secondary Education or the Council of
   Higher    Secondary      Education  or  the    concerned
   University, as the case may be, falls short of half of the
   percentage of students passing such examination for
   the entire Board or the Council or the University, as the
   case may be, for three consecutive years will face
   withdrawal of grant-in-aid.
F. For that the learned Tribunal failed to appreciate that
   as per the requirement of the statute every educational
   institution has to satisfy the Section 7-D(ii) of the
   Orissa Education Act, 1969 wherein it has been
   provided that the percentage of students passing the
   Annual and Supplementary examinations conducted by
   the Board of Secondary Education or the Council of
   Higher    Secondary      Education  or  the    concerned
   University, as the case may be, falls short of half of the
   percentage of students passing such examination for
   the entire Board or the Council or the University, as the
   case may be, for three consecutive years.

                       // 6 //
G. For   that  the   learned    Tribunal    relied upon    the
   Resolution dated 23.09.1981 of the erstwhile Education
   and Youth Services Department, wherein it has been
   provided that after receiving some representations from
   various quarters for rescinding the qualitative and
   quantitative criteria in the aforesaid resolution, the
   Government have been pleased to decide that the grant
   in aid to non Government Aided High Schools need not
   be subject to qualitative and quantitative assessment of
   the school performance for the present, the above said
   resolution was given effect to from 1st April, 1979, but
   learned Tribunal has failed to take judicial notice of
   Section 7-D (ii) of the Orissa Education Act, 1969,
   which is a statutory provision which was inserted by
   way of an amendment in the year 1994 and after
   coming into force of Section 7-D(ii) of the Orissa
   Education Act, the earlier Resolution dtd.23.09.1981 of
   the    erstwhile    Education     and     Youth   Services
   Department loses its force and as per the provision of
   Section 7-D(ii) the percentage of students passing the
   Annul and Supplementary examinations conducted by
   the Board of Secondary Education or the Council of
   Higher    Secondary       Education   or   the  concerned
   University, as the case may be, falls short of half of the
   percentage of students passing such examination for
   the entire Board then grant in aid already granted in
   favour of such institutions which are not satisfying the
   above said eligibility, cannot also claim grant in aid.
H. For that the learned Tribunal did not deal with the
   contentions made by the present appellants in the
   counter affidavit in the GIA case and disposed of the

                       // 7 //
   GIA case allowing the claim of the present respondents
   which is not sustainable in the eye of law.
I. For   that   the   learned   State Education   Tribunal
   committed an apparent error by entertaining the prayer
   made in the GIA case wherein relief was sought for
   under the Orissa Education (Payment of Grand-in-Aid
   to the High schools and Upper Primary Schools), Order,
   1994 which was repealed since long w.e.f. 05.02.2004
   and the present respondent approached the State
   Education Tribunal after a long gap of seven years, i.e.,
   in the year 2011 and the learned Tribunal directed the
   opposite parties therein to grant of benefits to the
   applicant therein under a repealed law which is not
   sustainable in the eye of law.
J. For that the learned Tribunal also failed to appreciate
   that when grant-in-aid was received in favour of the
   petitioner’s institution after amendment of the Orissa
   Education (Payment of Grant-in-Aid to the High
   Schools and Upper Primary Schools) Order, 2004 as
   amended on 22.09.2007 and they accepted the said
   grant-in-aid without any objection or allegation and
   raising a claim after a period of 4 years, should have
   been dismissed by the learned Tribunal on the ground
   of inordinate delay and on the principle of waiver and
   acquiescence.
K. Xxx       xxx            xxx             xxx        xxx
L. Xxx       xxx            xxx             xxx        xxx
M. Xxx       xxx            xxx             xxx        xxx
N. For that the learned Tribunal relied upon the ratio
   decided in the case of Prafulla Kumar Sahoo Vrs. State
   of Orissa and others reported in 2003(I) OLR-91

                     // 8 //
erroneously the facts in the case of Prafulla Kumar
Sahoo are not similar to the facts in the present case
on the following reasons:
   (i)    That Prafualla Kumar Sahoo was working in
          an institution which has already been notified
          by the State Government and his post was
          approved and grant-in-aid was released in his
          favour with effect from 01.06.1991 and he had
          filed his case for approval of his promotion
          against the post of Junior Librarian but in this
          instant case the institution has filed its case
          for   notification     as  an  aided   educational
          institution.
   (ii)   That while the case was decided the judgment
          was pronounced GIA Order 1994 was in force
          and he was claiming grant-in-aid as per that
          order but in this instant case, the Orissa
          Education (Payment of GIA to High Schools
          and Upper Primary Schools) Order 1994 has
          already    been      repealed  under   which   the
          applicant is now claiming GIA.
   (iii)  That said Prafulla Kumar Sahoo was an
          employee of a college and his service has been
          regulated by the Odisha (Non-Govt. College,
          Junior     Colleges      and   Higher   Secondary
          Schools) GIA Order 1994 and the same has
          been    taken      into  consideration  when   the
          judgment was passed. But in this instant
          case, the said order is not applicable to the
          Schools. On the other hand, the institution
          has filed case to notify as per GIA order called

                                   // 9 //
                          Orissa Education (Payment of G.I.A. to High
                          Schools and Upper Primary Schools) Order,
                          1994.
                   (iv)   That Prafulla Kuamr Sahoo had filed its case
                          challenging      the   rejection order    dated
                          09.08.2000 in which the State Govt. was
                          pleased to reject his claim on the ground of
                          financial ban. But in this instant case the
                          applicant’s institution has filed its case to
                          notify the institution as per the GIA Order
                          1994 after more than 14 years.
             O)    xxx        xxx              xxx             xxx
             P)     xxx        xxx             xxx             xxx”
      6.     Heard learned Standing Counsel for the School and Mass
Education Department and learned counsel for the respondent-
claimants. I have gone through the order of the tribunal.
      7.     By Government resolution dated 17.03.1979, it was kept
as an eligibility criteria that the result of the school must be 15
percent above the State average in Annual H.S.C. Exam. for a period of
four years continuously. However there has been another resolution on
23.09.1981 that the GIA to Non-Govt. Aided High Schools need not be
subject to qualitative and quantitative assessment of the school
performance for the present. This has been in force with effect from
01.04.1979.

                                    // 10 //
              In view of this position, the Tribunal having found the
ground of rejection of the claim of the applicants as untenable, it
cannot be held to be a flawed one. Thus the challenge to it in this
appeal fails.
       8.     The other ground of attack is because of repeal of the GIA
Order, 1994 by GIA Order, 2004 and 2008. The objection raised to the
eligibility to receive grant-in-aid as above, having been turned down,
the applicants have thus been found to be eligible to receive grant-in-
aid prior to the repeal of GIA Order, 1994 by subsequent GIA Order,
2004 and 2008.
              The ratio decided in case of Prafulla Kumar Sahu vrs.
State of Orissa, 2003(I) OLR-91, comes to the aid of the case of the
applicants. The Tribunal appears to have rightly answered the
question in favour of the applicant’s entitlement to the benefit of grant-
in-aid as per GIA Order 1994, relying upon the decisions in case of
Prafulla Kumar Sahu (supra); Managing Committee, Jayadurga High
School, Narla vrs. State of Orissa and others, in W.P.(C) No. 16767 of
2014 and that of Laxmidhar Pati and others vrs. State of Orissa and
others; 1996 (I) OLR 152.
              It has also rightly taken note of the similar benefits being
provided in case of few other High Schools as stated at page 17 of the
judgment similarly situated with this school in further applying the
doctrine of fair play and equity for grant of same benefit of grant-in-aid

                                               // 11 //
as per GIA Order, 1994. The entitlement has been held to be with
effect from 01.06.1994 i.e. on completion of four years after
presentation of first batch of students in the Annual Examination
which in this case was in the year 1991.
         9.        For the aforesaid discussion and reasons the finding of the
Tribunal holding the order of the opposite party no.1 under Annexure-
7 before it as untenable is not liable to be interfered with.
                   Consequentially, other directions given by the Tribunal to
the opposite parties to notify the Institution of the applicants as an
Aided Educational Institution as per the GIA Order, 1994 and
accordingly to approve the appointments of the applicants and release
of grant-in-aid in their favour as per their eligibility in accordance with
said GIA Order, 1994 and payment of differential admissible salary
hereby stand confirmed.
         10.       The appeal accordingly fails.
                   No order as to cost is passed.
                                                        ……………………..
