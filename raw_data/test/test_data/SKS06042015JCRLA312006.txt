S.K.SAHOO, J.       The appellant faced trial in the Court of learned Adhoc

building of the informant Udhaba @ Pabitra Das (P.W.9) with
bhujali on    09.08.2002 at about 11.00 p.m. having made
preparation to assault Panchei Das (hereafter “the deceased”),
wife of the informant and committed murder of the deceased and
also assaulted Jagani @ Srikanta Das (P.W.8), son of the
informant and the deceased with an attempt to commit his
murder.
       The learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
30.01.2006 held the appellant guilty under section 452, 302, 307
read with section 34 Indian Penal Code and accordingly convicted
him of such offences and sentenced him vide order dated

Section 302 IPC, R.I. for seven years for the offence under
Section 307 IPC and R.I. for three years for offence under Section
452 IPC and all the sentences were directed to run concurrently.
2.    The prosecution case, as per the First Information Report
lodged by P.W.9 Udhaba @ Pabitra Das on 10.08.2002 before
Officer-in-charge of Baramba Police Station is that the informant
was a worker in the tiffin stall of one Prafulla Sahu of village
Nuapatna which is situated under Tigiria Police Station. Out of the
four sons of the informant, the eldest and the second son were

                                 3
working outside. The deceased who was the wife of the informant
and their two minor sons namely, Jiban @ Jaguni @ Srikanta Das
(P.W.8) and Susanta Das were staying with the deceased. The
informant used to come to his house in every ten to fifteen days.
On 10.08.2002 morning at about 5.00 a.m., the brother-in-law of
the informant namely Raj Sahu (P.W.4) and nephew Chhabi Sahu
reached near the informant and informed him that the appellant
had committed murder of the deceased last night at about 11.00
p.m. They further informed him that two other persons were
there with the appellant and that the accused persons forcibly
entered inside the house of the informant and assaulted on the
back of the deceased by means of bhujali and that while two co-
accused persons were catching hold of the deceased, the
appellant assaulted the deceased by bhujali. When the minor son
Jagan (P.W.8) prevented the accused persons at the time of
assault, he was also assaulted by means of bhujali on his
abdomen and hands for which he had also received serious
injuries. Another minor son of the deceased namely, Susanta Das
escaped from the spot and informed the co-villagers. When the
co-villagers arrived at the house of the informant, the accused
persons had already left the spot.

                                  4
      On the basis of such F.I.R., Baramba P.S. Case No.95 of
2002 dated 10.08.2002 was registered under Section 452, 302,
307/34 IPC by P.W.11 Prasanta Kumar Bhuyan, A.S.I. of Police of

and M.O.V are the saree, saya and blouse of the deceased
respectively.
      The appellant examined himself as D.W.1.
5.    Now it is to be seen how far the prosecution has established
that the death of the deceased Panchei Das was homicidal in
nature.
       In order to establish such aspect, apart from the inquest
report (Ext.4/2), the prosecution examined the doctor P.W.10
who conducted autopsy over the dead body on 10.8.2002 at S.D.
Hospital, Athagarh and he found following injuries:-
External Injuries
        (i) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 1 ½” ellipitcal shape,
        edge smooth and clean cut over the left side of the
        back near the mid line at the T2 level;
        (ii)   Incised wound 1 ½” X ½” X 1 ½” elliptical
        shape, sharp edge over the left side of the back 2”
        from the mid line at T3 level;
        (iii) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 2” elliptical shape
        sharp edge 1” below the injury no.2;
        (iv) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 1” sharp edge over
        the left side of the back near to the injury no.3;
        (v) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 2” over the left side
        of the back 1” from the midline at T5 level;

                                 9
        (vi) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 2 ½” sharp edged
        elliptical shape over the left side of the back 3”
        away from the mid line at T6 level;
        (vii) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 2½” over the left
        side of the back below the injury no.6 sharp edge,
        elliptical shape;
        (viii) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X ½” over the left
        side of the back 6” away from the mid line at T8
        level;
        (ix) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 2” over the right
        side of the back ½” away from the mid line sharp
        edge at T4 level;
        (x) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 1 ½” over the right
        side the back 1 ½” from the mid line at T.5 level;
        (xi) Incised injury 1 ½” X ½” X 1” over the right
        side of the back 3 ½” away from the mid line at T5
        level;
      The doctor opined that all the injuries have been caused by
sharp cutting weapon and the cause of death was due to shock
and haemorrhage and all the injuries can cause death in ordinary
course of nature. The post-mortem report was proved as Ext.11.
      The learned counsel for the appellant did not challenge the
evidence of P.W.10 and the findings of the post mortem report
(Ext.11). After perusing the evidence on record, the post mortem
report (Ext.11) and the statement of P.W.10 Dr. Bidhyadhar

                                  10
Sahu, we are also of the view that the prosecution has proved the
death of the deceased to be homicidal in nature.
6.     The prosecution case is mainly based on the testimony of
P.W.8 Jagani @ Srikanta Das who has stated that on the date of
occurrence at about 8.00 to 9.00 p.m. after taking dinner when
he, his brother Susanta and their mother (deceased) were going
to bed, some persons came to their house and knocked at the
door and when the deceased opened the door, the appellant came
inside the house and asked for a match box. All on sudden the
appellant assaulted the deceased on her back, chest and hand by
means of a knife. When P.W.8 protested, the appellant also
assaulted him on his different parts of the body by knife causing
bleeding injuries on his person. He further stated that his brother
Sukanta escaped from the house to call the co-villagers and at
that time the accused persons fled away from the house. He
further stated that he was shifted to Barmba Hospital by his uncle
for treatment.
       P.W.8 is an injured eye witness. He has received as many
as nine cut injuries on different parts of the body which has been
proved by doctor P.W.5. Being an injured, the presence of P.W.8
at the spot cannot be doubted. Moreover, he being the minor son

                                 11
of the deceased, his presence in the night with her mother
(deceased) in the house is very natural.
       The learned counsel for the appellant Miss Pramila Mohanty
contended that P.W.8 is a tutored witness and at the instance of
his father, he has falsely implicated the appellant. We don’t find
any substance in the contention raised by the learned counsel for
the appellant. Merely because P.W.8 stated that he was deposing
as his father had told him, it cannot be inferred that he was
tutored by his father. The informant on receipt of the summons
might have told P.W.8 to depose in Court about the occurrence
and accordingly the possibility of P.W.8 making a statement like
that in the cross-examination cannot be ruled out but nothing has
been elicited in the cross-examination to show that he had no
knowledge about the occurrence but at the instance of his father
he was deposing falsely against the appellant in the Court. The
dead body of the deceased was found on the verandah of the
house with severe bleeding injury which has been noticed by the
independent witnesses so also of the I.O. and in the spot map
also, the I.O. has reflected where the dead body was found. The
seizure of the blood stained earth and broken bangles from the
spot is an additional factor which corroborate the evidence of
P.W.8 that the occurrence had taken place inside the house of the

                                  12
deceased. P.W.8 narrated vividly about the commission of murder
of his mother by the appellant and also about assault on him by
the appellant before others. Thus we find no infirmity in the
evidence of P.W.8 and accordingly we hold P.W.8 to be a truthful
and reliable witness.
       Law is well settled that an order of conviction can also be
sustained on the basis of the evidence of a solitary witness if his
evidence is found to be truthful, reliable, cogent, trustworthy and
above board. The evidence of P.W.8 is corroborated by his injury
report so also the post-mortem report. There is absolutely no
motive on the part of the P.W.8 to falsely implicate the appellant
in the crime. Therefore, we find that the learned trial Court has
rightly relied upon the evidence of P.W.8.
       The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that P.W.8
is a child witness and a child witness is always prone to tutoring
and therefore his evidence can only be accepted after close
scrutiny.
       Law is well settled that in view of Section 118 of Evidence
Act, there is no disqualification for a child to be witness in a case
but it is the requirement that the Court must conduct some
preliminary inquiry to be satisfied about the mental capability of a
child before allowing him to be examined. The question whether a

                                 13
child witness has intelligence enough to understand the import or
significance of questions or to give rational answers is not the
same as the question of his competency to testify. The Court has
discretion to form its own opinion whether a child witness has
sufficient understanding to be qualified to be a witness. The
possibility of a bias or the child being tutored should be taken
care of while analyzing his evidence. The Court should look for
corroboration to the evidence of a child witness, the surrounding
circumstances as well as the probabilities particularly when the
evidence betrays traces of tutoring. If the Court is of opinion that
by reason of tender years and immaturity of intellect, a child is
not competent to understand the questions put or to give rational
answers, he should not be allowed to be examined. If on careful
scanning, no flaws or infirmity are found in his evidence, there is
no impediment in accepting his evidence.
       We on close scrutiny found that the evidence of P.W.8, the
child witness who was aged about 14 years and reading in Class-V
at the time of deposition is credible and there is no exaggeration
in his evidence and he has stuck to his statement made during
investigation in all material particulars. The manner in which he
withstood the long gruelling cross examination and gave minute
details of the incident clearly indicates that he had attended a

                                  14
measure of mature understanding and there is no infirmity in his
understanding of the facts perceived and his ability to narrate the
same correctly.
7.    The learned counsel for the appellant contended that since
the injuries have not been inflicted on any vital part of the body
and even though the appellant was armed with a knife, he had
not caused any piercing injury to the deceased and while causing
number of injuries, he seems to have taken all precaution not to
assault on the front portion of the body of the deceased and there
was no internal damage, it can be said that the offence would not
attract ingredients of the offence under section 302 IPC and at
best the case would come within the purview of culpable homicide
not amounting to murder punishable under Section 304 Part-I
IPC.
      The learned counsel for the State on the other hand
submitted that the appellant has not only entered inside the
house of the deceased by knocking the door and asking for a
matchbox to the deceased in the night while she was in the
company of her minor children but also assaulted her mercilessly
causing as many as 11 incised injuries and therefore in absence of
any exception as provided under Section 300 IPC, the learned

                                  15
trial Court was justified in convicting the appellant under Section
302 IPC.
       While considering the rival contentions, it is required to take
note of the injuries found on the deceased as per post-mortem
report Ext.11. The doctor no doubt has noticed 11 incised injuries
on the person of the deceased but all the injuries are either on
the left side back or on the right side back and there are no
penetrating injuries and the injuries appear to be slicing in nature.
The appellants could have caused penetrating wounds on the
front portion of the body of the deceased with the knife but he
had not done so. There is no internal damage to any organ even
though a number of injures has been caused on the back side.
Thus it appears that the appellant had taken all precaution not to
cause any injury on the front portion of the deceased even though
he had opportunity to inflict such injuries. The doctor P.W.10 who
conducted post-mortem examination has stated specifically in the
cross-examination that the injuries found on the deceased are not
located on the vital parts of the body and during his examination,
he found the head, chest, spinal cord, lungs and abdomen were
intact.
       Now the question that falls for consideration in this appeal is
whether under the facts and circumstances of the case, the

                                 16
offence disclosed against the appellant is murder or culpable
homicide not amounting to murder.
      In case of State of Andhra Pradesh -v- Rayavarapu
Punnayya reported in A.I.R. 1977 SC 45, it is held as follows:-
        “21. From the above conspectus, it emerges that
        whenever a Court is confronted with the question
        whether the offence ‘murder’ or ‘culpable homicidal
        not amounting to murder’ on the facts of a case, it
        will be convenient for it to approach the problem in
        three stages. The question to be considered at the
        first stage would be, whether the accused has done
        an act by doing which he has caused the death of
        another. Proof of such casual connection between
        the act of the accused and the death leads to the
        second stage for considering whether that act of the
        accused amounts to “culpable homicide” as defined
        in section 299. If the answer to this question is
        prima facie in the affirmative, the stage for
        considering the operation of section 300, Penal
        Code is reached. This is the stage at which the
        Court should determine whether the facts proved by
        the prosecution bring the case within the ambit of
        any of the four clauses of the definition of ‘murder’
        contained in section 300. If the answer to this
        question is in the negative the offence would be
        ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’
        punishable under the first or the second part of
        section 304, depending, respectively, on whether
        the second or the third clause of section 299 is
        applicable. If this question is found in the positive,
        but the case comes within any of the exceptions
        enumerated in section 300, the offence would still
        be ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’,
        punishable under the First Part of section 304, Penal
        Code”.
      Keeping in view of the ratio laid down by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court and looking at the facts and circumstances of the

                                  17
case particularly post mortem report and the evidence of the
doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination, we found
that though the act of the appellant amounts to “culpable
homicide” as defined under Section 299 IPC, but while analyzing
the applicability of any of the four clauses of the definition of the
murder as contained in Section 300 IPC, we found that the facts
proved by the prosecution do not bring the case within the ambit
of any of such four clauses.
      The intention is the state of mind which has to be inferred in
the facts and circumstances of each case particularly from the
nature of weapon and how it was used and the injuries inflicted.
Even if the act of the appellant does not come within any of the
exceptions enumerated in Section 300 IPC but since it does not
come within the ambit of any of the four clauses of definition of
murder as enumerated in Section 300 IPC, therefore in our
considered opinion, the offence would be culpable homicide not
amounting to murder punishable under first part of Section 304
IPC. Thus the impugned judgment and order of conviction of the
appellant under Section 302 IPC is set aside and he is convicted
under Section 304 Part-I IPC.
8.    The appellant has been convicted under Section 307 IPC by
the learned trial Court for inflicting injuries to P.W.8 Jaguni @

                                   18
Srikanta Das. The medical report of P.W.8 who was examined by
doctor P.W.5 indicates as follows:-
        (i) Cut injury 1” X ½” X ¼” directed above
        downward on the wrist joint of left lower hand on
        the posterior part;
        (ii)  Cut injury 2½” X ¼” X ¼” directed laterally on
        palm thenar to hypothenar area of left side;
        (iii) Cut injury 1” X ½” X ¼” directed upward and
        medially on thenar area of left palm;
        (iv) Cut injury ½” X ¼” X ¼” directed laterally on
        the left first finger on the tip point;
        (v) Cut injury ½” X ½” X ¼” directed medially and
        downward       on   third   metatarsophalangeal joint
        anterior;
        (vi) Cut injury 1” X 1” X ¼” directed downward and
        laterally anterior part on the left upper arm middle
        one third;
        (vii) Cut injury ½” x ½” x ¼” directed laterally on
        elbow joint anterior laterally;
        (viii) Cut injury ½” x 1/2 “x ¼” directed above to
        downward on the upper border of right knee joint
        anteriorly;
        (ix) Liner cut injury 4” X ¼” X ¼” directed laterally
        and downward from spinal line towards tenth the rib
        of posterior axillary of right side.
      The injuries were opined to be simple in nature and possible
by sharp cutting weapon. Looking at the nature of injuries

                                  19
sustained, the manner of assault, the parts of the body on which
such injuries have been inflicted and lack of medical opinion that
any of the injuries were cumulatively dangerous to life and
absence of material that the death of P.W.8 was attempted to by
the appellant, we are of the view that the ingredients of the
offence under Section 307 IPC is not made out and accordingly we
alter the conviction from offence under Section 307 IPC to Section
324 IPC.
9.     So far as the conviction under Section 452 IPC is concerned,
we found from the evidence on record that the appellant has
committed house trespass having made preparation for causing
hurt to the deceased and therefore he has been rightly been held
guilty by the learned trial Court for offence under Section 452
IPC.
10.    It appears from the evidence on record that two other co-
accused persons had also participated in the crime but they
absconded for which charge-sheet was also submitted against
them showing them as absconders.
11.    In the net result, the appeal succeeds in part. Conviction of
the appellant under section 302/34 IPC is set aside and instead
the appellant is convicted under section 304 Part-I/34 IPC and
sentenced to undergo R.I. for ten years. Similarly the conviction

                                         20
       of the appellant under section 307/34 IPC is set aside and the
       said conviction is altered to under section 324/34 IPC and for the
       said conviction, the appellant is sentenced to undergo R.I. for two
       years. The order of conviction of the appellant under section
       452/34 IPC and the sentence of R.I. for three years as passed for
       such offence by the learned trial Court remains unaltered. All the
       sentences imposed under sections 304 Part-I/34, 324/34 and
       452/34 Indian Penal Code shall run concurrently.
              The appellant is in jail custody since 12.08.2002. Thus he
       has already undergone sentence imposed by us and therefore he
       should be set at liberty forthwith if he is not required to be
       detained in any other case.
              Accordingly, the Criminal Appeal is allowed in part.
