                            JUDGMENT
     PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
     Date of Hearing : 07.12.2016     &       Date of Judgment:21.12.2016
Dr.A.K.Rath, J.    This petition challenges the order dated 22.3.2016
     passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), First Court,
     Cuttack in EXP No.28 of 2004. By the said order, the learned trial
     court rejected the application of the judgment-debtors-petitioners
     and held that the decree-holder is entitled to the receive award

                                   2
amount with 15% interest from the date of filing of Misc.Case
No.117 of 1983 till the date of award i.e. 19.12.1996.
2.          Petitioner no.1, which is a Government Company,
entered into a works contract with the opposite party-company for
structural steel and cladding work for four bulk warehouses. The
work was to be completed within eighteen months from the date of
the award of the work order i.e., 14.12.1979. A contract was signed
between the parties wherein there was a provision for arbitration in
case of dispute that may arise between the parties. Before the work
completed, a dispute arose between the parties. On 21.3.1983 the
opposite party filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration
Act, 1940 before the learned Subordinate Judge, Cuttack, which was
registered as Misc. Case No.117 of 1983. The matter was referred to
a learned retired Judge of this Court for arbitration. On 24.6.1994
the arbitrator entered upon the reference for arbitration. The
arbitrator passed the award on 19.12.1996 and directed the
petitioner no.1 to pay Rs.19,55,368/- with pendente lite interest
@15% per annum from the date of institution of the suit till the date
of award. Thereafter the opposite party instituted T.S.No.574 of 1996
in the court of the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Cuttack for
making the award the Rule of Court. On 29.4.2002, the award was
made the Rule of the Court. Assailing the said order, the petitioners
filed ARBA No.9 of 2002 before this Court. The opposite party had
also filed CRP No.42 of 2002 before this Court against the said
order. On 5.8.2005 this Court dismissed both ARBA no.9 of 2002
and CRP No.42 of 2002. The petitioners filed SLP (C) No.23548 of

                                    3
2005 before the Hon’ble apex Court, which was subsequently
converted to C.A.No.3209 of 2007. The opposite party filed SLP(C)
No.3113 of 2006 before the Hon’ble apex Court, which was
subsequently converted to C.A.No.3210 of 2007. Both the appeals
were taken up on 10.3.2015. C.A.No.3209 of 2007 was dismissed for
non-prosecution. C.A.No.3210 of 2007 was dismissed, thereby order
of this Court was confirmed. While dismissing the appeal, the apex
Court held as follows:
                  “After giving our anxious consideration in the
           matter, we do not find any reason to interfere with
           the impugned order passed by the High Court
           holding that the grant of 15% pendent elite interest
           will meet the ends of justice. No direction can be
           issued for grant of future interest. We do not find
           any merit in Civil Appeal No.3210 of 2007. The
           same is, accordingly, dismissed.
                  However, the appellant shall proceed to
           execute the decree for recovery of the Award
           amount together with interest as awarded by the
           Arbitrator.”                          (emphasis laid)
3.         Thereafter the petitioners filed a petition under Order 21
Rule 22 read with Section 47 C.P.C. in Execution Petition No.28 of
2004. In course of hearing, the petition filed under Order 21 Rule 22
read with Section 47 of C.P.C. was not pressed. A contention was
advanced by the judgment-debtors that since the award amount had
been paid, they were not liable to pay any interest. The decree-
holder, on the other hand, submitted that it was entitled to 15%
interest per annum from the date of institution of the suit till the
date of award. The learned trial court came to hold that the decree-
holder is entitled to receive the award amount with 15% interest

                                     4
from the date of filing of Misc.Case No.117 of 1983 till the date of
award i.e., 19.12.1996. .
4.          Heard Mr.N.K.Mishra, learned Senior Advocate along
with Mr.Nitish Kumar Mishra, learned Advocate for the petitioners
and Mr.Y.Das, learned Senior Advocate along with Mr.Somadarshan
Mohanty, learned Advocate for the opposite party.
5.          Mr.Mishra, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners
submitted that the award was made the Rule of Court. Since the
same was challenged by both the parties, the decree could not be
executed till it attained finality by the Hon’ble apex Court. The entire
award amount has already been paid. No execution case has been
filed after dismissal of the appeal before the Hon’ble apex Court.
Misc. Case No.117 of 1983 filed by the opposite party under Section
8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 for appointment of Arbitrator can not
be construed to be a suit. The learned trial court committed a
manifest illegality in construing the same as suit. The proceedings
under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 cannot be treated as a
suit. The arbitrator having entered upon a reference on 24.6.1994
and the parties having appeared in pursuance of notice, the word
pendente lite can only suggest the period from the said date till the
date of award i.e. 19.12.1996. The adjudication of the claim having
been made only in the award dated 19.12.1996, at the most, the
pendente lite interest may mean the said interregnum period only.
He further submitted that the arbitrator has passed an award
directing the petitioners to pay a sum of Rs.19,55,368/- with
pendente lite interest at the rate of 15% per annum from the date of

                                      5
institution of the suit till the date of award. There was no suit in the
court below. Thus, the petitioners are not liable to pay any interest.
He cited the decision in the case of Orissa State Cooperative
Marketing Federation Ltd. Vrs. Associated Marketing Co., AIR 1982
ORISSA 1.
6.          Per contra, Mr.Y.Das, learned Senior Advocate for the
opposite party submitted that the Arbitrator has awarded a sum of
Rs.19,55,368/- with pendente lite interest at the rate of 15% per
annum from the date of institution of the suit till the date of award.
Filing of application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act before the
learned Civil Judge, Cuttack can be construed as the date of filing of
the suit. The award amount was not paid. The opposite party
challenged the order making the award the Rule of Court before this
Court, so also the Hon’ble apex Court. The Hon’ble apex Court in
Civil Appeal No.3209 of 2007 held that the opposite party is entitled
to 15% pendente lite interest and directed to execute the decree for
recovery of the award amount. The learned trial court by a reasoned
order held that the opposite party is entitled to receive the awarded
amount with 15% interest from the date of filing of Misc.Case
No.117 of 1983 till the date of award, i.e., 19.12.1996. He cited the
decisions in the case of Puran Ram Vrs. Bhaguram and another, AIR
2008 SC 1960 and Patel Road Ways Ltd. Vrs. Birla Yamaha Ltd, AIR
2000 SC 1461.
7.          Before delving deep into the matter, it is apt to refer the
decisions cited at the Bar. In the case of Puran Ram (supra), the
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the High Court ought not to have

                                     6
interfered with the order of the trial court when the order of the trial
court was passed on sound consideration of law and facts and when
it cannot be said that the order of the trial court was either without
jurisdiction or perverse or arbitrary.
8.          In Orissa State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd.,
(supra), this Court held that an application under Section 20 of the
Arbitration Act, is really not a ‘suit’ though under the rules of
procedure prescribed by this Court such applications are treated as
suits. The word ‘suit’ has not been defined in the Code of Civil
Procedure but the word is a term of art and ordinarily means a
proceeding instituted in a Civil Court by the presentation of a plaint.
In Patel Roadways Ltd. (supra), the apex Court held that the term
“suit” is a generic term taking within its sweep all proceedings
initiated by a party for realization of a right vested in him under law.
The meaning of the term ‘suit’ also depends on the context of its
user which in turn, amongst other things, depends on the Act or the
rule in which it is used.
9.          In view of the authoritative pronouncement of the Hon’ble
apex Court in the case of Orissa State Co-operative Marketing
Federation    Ltd.,(supra),   the   inescapable    conclusion   is  that
application under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act can not be
construed as suit.
10.          The next question arises for consideration as to the
award of pendente lite interest. The apex Court in Civil Appeal
No.3209 of 2007 did not incline to interfere with the order passed by

                                    7
this Court and held that grant of 15% pendente lite interest will
meet the ends of justice. No direction was issued for grant of future
interest. Thus the opposite party is entitled to receive 15% pendente
lite interest per annum on the award.
11.          In view of the discussions made above, the opposite party
is entitled to 15% interest on the award from the date of award i.e.,
19.12.1996 till the date of payment. The order of the court below is
modified accordingly. The petition is disposed of. There shall be no
order as to costs.
                                               …………..……………..
