           PRESENT:
                              THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M. M. DAS
           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. Das, J.                    Villages,        namely,         Raghavpur,           Amrutpur,
           Madhupur, Nuagaon and Ratakana, were earlier under Gedma
           Grama Panchayat in Hatdihi Block in the district of Keonjhar. As
           Gedma was a large area consisting of several villages, considering
           the demand made by the villagers for formation of a new Grama
           Panchayat , the Block Development Officer, Hatadihi                            vide his

                                    2
letter dated 2.1.1996 addressed to the Sub-Collector, Anandpur
recommended for formation of a new Grama Panchayat, namely,
Raghavpur Grama Panchayat. The State Government vide its
notification No. 20211 dated 9.11.2001 constituted Raghavpur
Grama Panchayat consisting of the aforesaid five villages.
Thereafter, by a corrigendum dated 12.11.2001 to the above
notification, notified that in the above notification, the word
“Raghavpur” appearing in the column no.3          be corrected and
read as “Itipur” and in column-4, after serial no. 5, the name of
Itipur village be inserted as serial no. 6 with a population of 440
and the total population be corrected as 2389. Hence, by the said
corrigendum the name of the Grama Panchayat was changed
from “Raghavpur” to “Itipur”. Being aggrieved by the said decision
of the Government, some of the petitioners filed O.J.C. No. 15359
of 2001 before this Court and the said writ petition was disposed
of by a common judgment along with similar matters directing
the petitioners therein to file a representation before the
Secretary, Panchayati Raj Department for taking appropriate
action at his end. The said petitioners, accordingly, filed a
representation on 15.12.2001 making a two-fold prayer, one
being to change the name of the Grama Panchayat from “Itipur”
to “Raghavpur” and the second being to fix the headquarters of
the Grama Panchayat at Raghavpur. The State Government in its

                                   3
Panchayati Raj Department sought for a report from the
Collector, Keonjhar vide letter dated 16.1.2002 and subsequent
letter dated 17.6.2002 with regard to fixation of the headquarters
of the newly created Itipur Grama Panchayat thereby impliedly
declining the prayer of the said petitioners for change of the name
of the Grama Panchayat, but keeping the consideration open with
regard to fixation of the headquarters of the Grama Panchayat.
The Collector, Keonjhar – opp. Party no. 2 vide his letter dated
10.5.2002 intimated the Deputy Secretary to the Government,
Panchayati Raj Department that he has caused an enquiry
through the Block Development Officer, Hatadihi and enclosed
the report dated 22.3.2002 of the said Block Development Officer
along with the letter. The State Government after receiving the
report from the Collector, by a notification No. 16308 dated
9.9.2002 declared the headquarters of Itipur Grama Panchayat at
Raghavpur (Annexure-8).        Some of the petitioners in W.P. (C)
No. 5119 of 2002 challenged the said notification dated 9.9.2002
under Annexure-8 in W.P. (C) No. 3816 of 2002 on the ground
that the representation of the petitioners, which was filed before
the Secretary, Panchayati Raj Department pursuant to the earlier
order of this Court was not considered in its proper perspective
and the Government has completely lost sight of the earlier letter
of the Block Development Officer dated 2.1.1996 in which he

                                           4
recommended that the name of the Grama Panchayat should be
Raghavpur and the Government only fixed the headquarters of
the Grama Panchayat at Raghavpur. However, the said writ
petition, being W.P. (C) No. 3816 of 2002, was withdrawn by
order dated 3.12.2002.             The Government subsequent thereto
issued a notification no. 22569 dated 5.11.2002 vide Annexure-1
to the following effect:-
                                 “GOVERNMENT OF ORISSA
                           PANCHAYATI RAJ (G.P.) DEPARTMENT
                   No. LS –II-135/2002-22569/G.P. BBSR. Dated the 5.11.02.
                               NOTIFICATION
                           In exercise of powers conferred by Sub-Section
              (3) of Section 4 of O.G.P. Act, 1964 and on consideration
              of resolution of Itipur G.P. dt. 24.9.2002 and report of
              the B.D.O., Hatdihi, the State Govt. have been pleased
              to revoke the earlier notification No. 16308 dt. 9.9.2002
              fixing Head Quarters of Itipur G.P. at Raghabpur and
              order      that     considering     the    central     location,
              administrative suitability, availability of infrastructural
              facilities like, Hospital, School, Colleges and other Govt.
              institution, the Headquarters of Itipur G.P. shall be fixed
              at Itipur within the limits of said Grama.
                                         By order of the Governor.
                                            Sd/- S.K.Pradhan.
                                    Deputy Secretary to Government.”
Being aggrieved by the notification under Annexure-1, the
petitioners    have       preferred      the    present      writ     petition  for
appropriate relief.
2.                The       State    Government        has      filed   a   counter
affidavit, inter alia, stating that on a subsequent representation

                                    5
being filed, the Government reconsidered the matter along with
the resolution dated 24.9.2002 of the Itipur Grama Panchayat
and finding that Itipur Grama Panchayat is more suitable to be
fixed as the headquarters of the Grama Panchayat, issued the
impugned notification and no illegality can be attributed to the
said notification. The petitioners have also filed a rejoinder to the
said counter affidavit. A counter affidavit has also been filed on
behalf of the private opp. Parties.
3.              A perusal of the report of the Block Development
Officer, which was enclosed to the letter of the Collector,
Keonjhar addressed to the Government in Panchayati Raj
Department, discloses that both Raghavpur and Itipur villages
are   similarly situated in the Grama Panchayat with regard to
distance from the other villages. Similar facilities are also
available in both the villages.
4.              Section 3 (1) of the Orissa Grama Panchayat Act,
1964 provides that the State Government may, for the purpose of
the said Act, constitute any village or group of contiguous villages
as a Grama and assign to such Gram, a name, which shall be of
one of the villages comprised with the Grama by notifying the
same in the Gazette. Section 3 (2) of the Orissa Grama Panchayat
Act provides that the State Government wherever deem fit so to

                                  6
do may cancel any notification in respect of a Grama under sub-
section (1) or may alter the area comprised in a Grama by
reducing or adding to the number of villages comprised within
such Grama and notify the same in the gazette. Sub-section (3) of
section 4 of the Orissa Grama Panchayat Act provides that the
office of the headquarters of the Grama Sasan shall be situated
within the limits of Grama and unless otherwise ordered by the
State Government in the village bearing the name of the Grama.
5.               From the facts of the present case, it appears
that the Government on due consideration of the report of the
Block     Development   Officer,   though   initially fixed  the
headquarters of the Grama Panchayat at Raghavpur, but
subsequently altered the same by the impugned notification
notifying that the headquarters shall be situated at “Itipur”. It
further appears that though as per the law laid down in the case
of Bijay Kumar Behera and others v. State of Orissa and
others, AIR 2001 Orissa, 164 that the resolution of a Grama
Panchayat cannot be a ground to shift the headquarters of
Grama Panchayat and in the impugned notification, such a
resolution has been referred to, but it appears that the
Government has also taken into consideration all other aspects
while issuing the notification impugned in this writ petition.
Thus, the impugned notification is not solely based on the

                                  7
resolution of the Itipur Grama Panchayat and, as such, the ratio
of the above decision cannot be made application to the facts of
this case.
6.              Learned counsel for the State also submitted that
elections of Ward Members, Naib Sarpanch and Sarpanch have
been conducted to the office of Itipur Grama Panchayat in the
meanwhile and the construction of the building of the Grama
Panchayat office has also been completed at Itipur, where the
Panchayat Office is functioning.
7.              In view of the above, this Court does not find any
arbitrariness or illegality in the impugned notification dated
5.11.2002 vide Annexure-1.       The writ petition is accordingly
dismissed, being devoir of merit, but in the circumstances
without cost.
                The interim order passed earlier stands vacated
and all pending Misc. Cases also stand disposed of.
                                          ………………………
                                            M.M. Das, J.
