        2006 from the order dated 21.12.2011 passed by the Authorized

        P R E S E N T:

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. K. SAHOO, J.           The appellant Gangadhar Sahoo has knocked at the
        portals of this Court for the third time by preferring this appeal
        under section 17 of the Orissa Special Courts Act, 2006
        (hereafter ‘2006 Act’) challenging the impugned order dated
        21.12.2011 passed by the learned Authorized Officer, Special
        Court, Bhubaneswar in Confiscation Case No.3 of 2011 in

                                 2
rejecting his petition dated 22.11.2011 filed for dismissal of the
confiscation proceeding, holding the same as not maintainable.
2.          The factual scenario of the case shows that Cuttack
Vigilance P.S. Case No.10 of 1984 was instituted against the
appellant on the basis of the first information report dated
09.03.1984 presented by Sri P.K. Behura, D.S.P., Vigilance,
Cuttack Division, Cuttack which ultimately resulted in submission
of charge sheet on 28.09.1988 by Sri B.B. Mohapatra, D.S.P.,
Vigilance, Cuttack Division, Cuttack under section 5(2) read with
section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947
(hereafter ‘1947 Act’) against the appellant on the accusation of
possession    of   disproportionate  assets   to   the   tune   of
Rs.5,02,530.86 paisa to his known sources income during the
check period from 05.08.1971 to 15.03.1984 after obtaining
necessary sanction from the competent authority as per section
6(1)(b) of the 1947 Act. The said case is now subjudiced for trial
before the learned Special Judge, Special Court, Bhubaneswar in
T.R. Case No.13 of 2008.
3.          The State Government in Home Department in
exercise of the power conferred under section 5 of the 2006 Act
made a declaration in respect of the appellant on dated

                                  3
11.07.2008 which was published in the Extraordinary Orissa
Gazette dated 15th July 2008. The declaration reads as follows:-
                    HOME DEPARTMENT
                         DECLARATION
                      The 11th July 2008
                         FORM NO. I
                          (See Rule-7)
           S.R.O. No.345/08-WHEREAS, it was alleged
           that Shri    Gangadhar     Sahoo,   S/o.  Lokanath
           Sahoo of Village Kusunda, P.S. Banki, District
           Cuttack, State Orissa, while holding high Public
           Office in the State of Orissa, i.e. Ex-Executive
           Engineer, CADA (Command Area Development
           Authority), Bhubaneswar committed an offence
           under clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 5
           of   the  Prevention    of  Corruption   Act, 1947
           corresponding to clause (e) of sub-section (1) of
           Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
           1988 and that the matter was investigated in
           Cuttack Vigilance P.S. Case No.10, dated the 9th
           March 1994.
                 AND WHEREAS, on scrutiny of relevant
           materials    available   on   record,   the   State
           Government is of the opinion that there is prima
           facie case of commission of the offence of Shri
           Gangadhar      Sahoo,     who   has    accumulated
           properties disproportionate to his known sources
           of income by resorting to corrupt means:

                                   4
                  AND WHEREAS, it is felt necessary and
             expedient by the Government that the said
             offender should be tried by the Special Court
             established under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of
             Special Courts Act, 2006:
                  NOW,    THEREFORE,     in  exercise  of  the
             powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 5
             of Special Courts Act, 2006 (Orissa Act 9 of
             2007), the State Government do hereby declare
             that the said offence shall be dealt with under
             the Special Courts Act, 2006.
                                      [No.3173-C]
                                 By order of the Governor
                                   TARUNKANTI MISHRA
                            Principal Secretary to Government
4.           On the first occasion, the appellant filed WPCRL
No.54 of 2009 before this Court challenging the aforesaid
notification dated 11.07.2008 and the constitutional validity of
2006 Act and the rules framed thereunder. A Division Bench of
this Court disposed of the writ petition along with a batch of
other cases by a common judgment dated 16.09.2010 in case of
Dibyadarshi Biswal and others -Vrs.- State of Orissa
reported in (2011) 49 Orissa Criminal Reports 1, in which
the prayer made to quash the notification issued under section
5(1) of 2006 Act was turned down and it was held that 2006 Act
prevails over the Central laws regarding confiscation proceeding.

                                 5
It was further held that the 2006 Act and Prevention of Money
Laundering Act (hereafter ‘PML Act’) were operating in different
fields and therefore, the provisions of 2006 Act are not
repugnant to the provisions of PML Act as amended by
Amendment Act, 2009. The other points which were raised by
the petitioners including the appellant in the batch cases which
are not relevant for adjudication of this criminal appeal, were
also not accepted and accordingly, the writ petitions were
dismissed being devoid of merits and the Special Courts which
were constituted under the provisions of 2006 Act were directed
to conduct expeditious trial and dispose of the cases by following
the Criminal Procedure Code by taking up the cases on day to
day basis.
            The appellant along with others challenged the
common judgment and order dated 16.09.2010 passed in case of
Dibyadarshi Biswal (supra) by way of filing Special Leave
Petitions which were disposed of by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in a common judgment dated 10.12.2015 in case of Yogendra
Kumar Jaiswal -Vrs.- State of Bihar reported in (2016) 63
Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 426 wherein it was held, inter
alia, that 2006 Act is not hit by Article 199 of the Constitution
and the establishment of Special Courts under 2006 Act is not

                                  6
violative of Article 247 of the Constitution and the provisions
pertaining to declaration and effect of declaration as contained in
sections 5 and 6 of 2006 Act are constitutionally valid as they do
not suffer from any unreasonableness or vagueness. It was
further held that the Chapter III of 2006 Act providing for
confiscation of property or money or both neither violates Article
14 nor Article 20(1) or Article 21 of the Constitution. It was
further held that the procedure provided for confiscation and the
proceedings before the Authorized Officer do not cause any
discomfort    either to   Article 14    or   Article 20(3)    of  the
Constitution.
             The appellant in the appeal memo has not made any
averment relating to his earlier approach to this Court in WPCRL
No.54 of 2009 rather it is indicated in the cause title as follows:-
             “The matter out of which this appeal arises was
             never before this Court in this form.”
             The learned Standing Counsel for the Vigilance
Department is quite justified in making his submission that the
appellant has not acted fairly in suppressing the dismissal of his
earlier petition vide WPCRL No.54 of 2009 by this Court which
was confirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. In case of
Ramjas Foundation -Vrs.- Union of India reported in
(2010) 14 Supreme Court Cases 38, it is held as follows:-

                                   7
            "14. The principle that a person who does not
            come to the Court with clean hands is not
            entitled to be heard on the merits of his
            grievance and, in any case, such person is not
            entitled to any relief is applicable not only to the
            petitions filed under Articles 32, 226 and 136 of
            the Constitution but also to the cases instituted
            in other courts and judicial forums. The object
            underlying the principle is that every Court is not
            only entitled but is duty bound to protect itself
            from unscrupulous litigants who do not have any
            respect for truth and who try to pollute the
            stream of justice by resorting to falsehood or by
            making misstatement or by suppressing facts
            which have bearing on adjudication of the
            issue(s) arising in the case."
             When the appellant earlier approached this Court in a
writ petition for quashing the notification issued under section
5(1) of 2006 Act on the basis of which the confiscation
proceeding was instituted and the prayer was turned down, in
the fairness of things, the appellant should have mentioned
about his earlier approach in the appeal memo and should not
have mentioned in the cause title simply that the appeal was
never before this Court in this form. Similarly while extracting
the Extraordinary Orissa Gazette declaration dated 11.07.2008,
certain vital words like “corresponding to clause (e) of sub-

                                   8
section (1) of section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988” after the words “section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1947” have been omitted. When it was pointed out by the
learned Standing Counsel for the Vigilance Department, learned
counsel for the appellant submitted that it was inadvertently
done.
             It is a common knowledge that such mistakes do
occur. For any lapse or mistake which is unintentional, nobody
can be prohibited to ventilate his grievances in the Court of law.
However, a petition before its presentation in the Court of law is
required to be carefully drafted and verified and any kind of
factual error should be avoided.
5.           On the second occasion, the appellant approached
this Court in Criminal Appeal No.410 of 2011 challenging the
order dated 18.06.2011 of the learned Authorized Officer,
Special Court, Bhubaneswar in the same confiscation proceeding
in rejecting his prayer for dismissal of the proceeding. This Court
vide judgment and order dated 04.11.2011 turned down the
contentions raised by the appellant that since the property in
question is in custodia legis of the learned trial Court, the
initiation of the confiscation proceeding is not permissible
particularly when the trial of the case is subjudiced.

                                9
6.          It appears that immediately after the disposal of
Criminal Appeal No.410 of 2011, another petition was filed by
the appellant on dated 22.11.2011 on the ground that the
confiscation proceeding flows from the criminal proceeding
started against him under section 13(2) read with section
13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (hereafter
‘1988 Act’) for the accumulation of disproportionate assets
during the check period from 05.08.1971 to 15.03.1984, during
which period 1988 Act was not in force and the alleged act which
is the subject matter of the confiscation proceeding was not an
‘offence’ under the 1988 Act which came into force with
prospective effect from 09.09.1988. The learned Authorized
Officer relying upon the provision under section 30(2) of the
1988 Act held that any act cognizable under the 1947 Act shall
be held cognizable under the 1988 Act notwithstanding the fact
that 1988 Act was not in force when the alleged occurrence took
place. The learned Authorized Officer placed reliance upon the
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Nar Bahadur
Bhandari -Vrs.- State of Sikkim reported in A.I.R. 1998
S.C. 2203 wherein it was held that the Special Judge constituted
under section 3 of the 1988 Act is competent to try the offences

                                 10
punishable under 1947 Act by virtue of the deeming provision
under section 30(2) of the 1988 Act.
            The order passed by the learned Authorized Officer is
the subject matter of challenge in this criminal appeal.
7.          Mr.   Hemanta     Kumar     Mund,    learned  counsel
appearing for the appellant contended that the appellant is being
charged and prosecuted for the offence under section 5(2) read
with section 5(1)(e) of the 1947 Act. Section 2(d) of 2006 Act
defines the term ‘offence’ which means an offence of criminal
misconduct within the meaning of clause (e) of sub-section (1) of
section 13 of 1988 Act and not under section 5(1)(e) of 1947 Act
and therefore, neither a person charge sheeted for an offence
under section 5(1)(e) of 1947 Act can be prosecuted for the
offence under section 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act nor convicted
thereunder and therefore, the appellant cannot be proceeded
under the provisions of Chapter III of the 2006 Act. It is further
contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that the very
filing of an application for confiscation before the learned
Authorized Officer against a person accused of an offence under
section 5(1)(e) of 1947 Act is not in accordance with law and
therefore, the impugned order should be set aside by quashing
the confiscation proceeding. It is further contended that as per

                                   11
the provisions of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 the
appellant can only be proceeded for confiscation of property
involved in the case in accordance with law as it prevailed by
then prior to the repeal of 1947 Act. The learned counsel for the
appellant placed reliance in case of Jagan M. Seshadri -Vrs.-
State of Tamil Nadu reported in A.I.R. 2002 S.C. 2399.
              Mr. Sanjay Kumar Das, learned Standing Counsel for
the    Vigilance  Department    on  the  other  hand   vehemently
contended that the retrospective applicability of 2006 Act has
been discussed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of
Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal (supra) and it was held that the
provisions relating to the accused under 1988 Act facing the
interim confiscation proceeding under 2006 Act does not violate
any constitutional assurance. It is contended by the learned
counsel that in view of section 6(2) of 2006 Act, the case of the
appellant was transferred to the Special Court, Bhubaneswar for
trial of the offence in accordance with 2006 Act and after transfer
of the record to the Special Court and on receipt of authorization
from the Government, the Special Public Prosecutor made an
application for confiscation before the learned Authorized Officer,
Special Court, Bhubaneswar under section 13(1) of 2006 Act and
accordingly, Confiscation Case No.3 of 2011 was instituted. It is

                                 12
contended that the intention of pre-trial confiscation is an interim
measure and not a punishment as held by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case of Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal (supra) and
therefore, when the declaration made under section 5(1) of 2006
Act by the State Government in the Extraordinary Orissa Gazette
relating to the appellant was held to be valid in the case of
Dibyadarshi Biswal (supra) and the writ petition filed by the
appellant was dismissed and the same was upheld by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court, the contention raised by the appellant to
drop/dismiss the confiscation proceeding is not sustainable in the
eye of law. Learned counsel placed reliance on section 30(2) of
1988 Act, section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and also
section 21 of 2006 Act and contended that there is no illegality in
the continuance of the confiscation proceeding.
8.            Section 13(1) of 2006 Act states that where on the
basis of prima facie evidence, the State Government have
reasons to believe that any person who has held high public or
political office has committed the offence, whether or not the
Special Court has taken cognizance of the offence, may authorise
the Public Prosecutor for making an application to the Authorized
Officer for confiscation of the money and other property under

                                   13
2006 Act which the State Government believe the said person to
have procured by means of the offence.
            The offence, as per section 2(d) of 2006 Act means
an offence of criminal misconduct within the meaning of clause
(e) of sub-section (1) of section 13 of the 1988 Act. As per
section 30(1) of 1988 Act, even though 1947 Act was repealed
but in sub-section (2) of section 30, it is mentioned that
notwithstanding such repeal, but without prejudice to the
application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of
1897), anything done or any action taken or purported to have
been done or taken under or in pursuance of 1947 Act shall,
insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of 1988 Act,
be deemed to have been done or taken under or in pursuance of
the corresponding provision of 1988 Act. Section 6 of the
General Clauses Act, 1897 indicates, inter alia that where any
Central Act repeals any enactment, then, unless a different
intention appears, the repeal shall not affect the previous
operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or
suffered thereunder or affect any investigation, legal proceeding
or remedy, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be
instituted,  continued   or   enforced,  and    any   such  penalty,

                                  14
forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act
had not been passed. The objective of the provision is to ensure
protection of any right or privilege acquired under the repealed
Act. The only exception to it is legislative intention to the
contrary i.e. the repealing Act, may expressly provide or it may
impliedly provide against continuance of such right, obligation or
liability.
             In the case of Nar Bahadur Bhandari (supra), it
was held that sub-section (2) of section 30 of the 1988 Act, on
the one hand ensures that the application of section 6 of the
General Clauses Act is not prejudiced, on the other it expressed
a different intention as contemplated by the said section. The
last part of sub-section introduced legal fiction whereby anything
done or action taken under or in pursuance of 1947 Act shall be
deemed to have been done or taken under or in pursuance of the
corresponding provision of the 1988 Act. The fiction is to the
effect that the 1988 Act had come into force when such thing
was done or action was taken.
             Section 21 of 2006 Act provides, inter alia, that the
provisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in
derogation of, any other law for the time being in force.

                                15
            The learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance
in case of Jagan M. Seshadri (supra). In the said case, the
appellant faced trial for commission of offence under sections
5(1)(d) and (e) read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1947 and was acquitted by the learned trial
Court. The State challenged the order of acquittal. The High
Court accepted the appeal of the State and reversed the order of
acquittal of the appellant and the appellant was convicted for
offences under section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988 read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988. According to the High Court, since charge was framed
after 09.09.1988, though, with regard to offence allegedly
committed by the appellant during the check period 1977-1984,
the appellant should have been charged under section 13(1)(e)
read with section 13(2) of the 1988 Act and not under section
5(1)(e) of the 1947 Act. Relying on section 30 of the 1988 Act,
the High Court opined that the appellant shall be 'deemed' to
have been charged for offences under section 13(1)(e) read with
section 13(2) of the 1988 Act and the framing of charge by the
trial Court under section 5(1)(e) read with section 5(2) of the
1947 Act, was invalid. The appellant challenged the order of the

                                  16
High Court before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. It was held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court as follows:-
           “7. A bare reading of Section 30(2) of the 1988
           Act shows that any act done or any action taken
           or purported to have been done or taken under
           or in pursuance of the repealed Act, shall, in so
           far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of
           this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken
           under or in pursuance of the corresponding
           provisions of the Act. It does not substitute
           Section 13 in place of Section 5 of the 1947 Act.
           Section 30(2) is applicable "without prejudice to
           the application of Section 6 of the General
           Clauses     Act,   1897".   In  our   opinion,   the
           application of Section 13 of the 1988 Act to the
           fact situation of the present case would offend
           Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which,
           inter alia provides that repeal shall not (i) affect
           previous operation of any enactment so repealed
           or anything duly done or suffered thereunder or
           (ii) affect any investigation legal proceedings or
           remedy in respect of any such rights, privilege,
           obligation, penalty, forfeiture of punishment.
           Section 13 both in the matter of punishment as
           also by the addition of the explanation to Section
           13(1)(e) is materially different from Section 5 of
           the 1947 Act. The presumption permitted to be
           raised under the explanation to Section 13(1)(e)
           was not available to be raised under Section 5

                                  17
            (1 )(e) of the 1947 Act. This difference can have
            a material bearing on the case.”
            The factual scenario of the present case is different
from that of Jagan M. Seshadri (supra). In the present case,
the appellant has been charge sheeted under section 5(2) read
with section 5(1)(e) of the 1947 Act and he is also facing trial for
such   offence   before    the  Special   Judge,   Special  Court,
Bhubaneswar in T.R. Case No.13 of 2008. The declaration made
by the State Government in purported exercise of power
conferred under section 5(1) of 2006 Act in the Extraordinary
Orissa Gazette vide notification dated 11.07.2008 mentions that
the appellant has committed an offence under clause (e) of sub-
section (1) of Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947
corresponding to clause (e) of sub-section (1) of section 13 of
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and therefore, the said
offence shall be dealt with under 2006 Act.
9.          The phraseology of section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act,
which, except for the explanation as added to that section, is in
pari materia with      section 5(1)(e) of the     1947   Act. The
explanation has been added in 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act wherein the
meaning of “known sources of income” has been defined. Both
are conceptually period offences and it has reference to assets
accumulated and known sources of income in a particular period.

                                 18
The obligation of the accused public servant to satisfactorily
account for the assets remains the same under both 1947 Act
(after  1964   amendment)     and   under  the  1988   Act.  The
requirement of law also remains the same. The accused public
servant has to account for to the satisfaction of the Court that
the assets available with him were not disproportionate to the
known sources of his income. The onus in this regard has not
undergone any change or modification with the introduction of
the explanation to section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act. Therefore,
under 1988 Act, the accused public servant should have a lawful
source of income and the said income should also have been
intimated to the authorities concerned in accordance with law
and then only the Court can take it as ‘known sources of
income’. The explanation does not alter or change the law on
what or which assets the accused public servant are required to
be account for. The assets can be those which have been
disclosed and also other assets which have not been disclosed by
the public servant but there must be evidence that the assets
are possessed or belonged to or held by the accused public
servant. The law on this aspect has not undergone any
substantial change or altered by introduction of the explanation
to section 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act.

                                   19
10.           The objects and reasons of 2006 Act place immense
emphasis on corruption amongst the persons holding high
political and public offices in the State of Orissa and the stress is
on   the   accumulation    of   vast  property    by such    persons,
disproportionate to their known sources of income by resorting
to corrupt means and to prosecute persons involved in such
corrupt practices and for establishment of Special Courts to
prevent delay in the final determination of the guilt or innocence
of the persons to be tried. In case of Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal
(supra),    it  was   held   that   the  legislative  policy   behind
establishment of Special Courts for trial of accused involved in
the offence under section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act in respect of
certain categories of accused is absolutely impeccable and it is
saved from the vice of Article 14 of the Constitution. The
retrospective applicability of 2006 Act in respect of the accused
persons arrayed as accused under 1988 Act was also upheld,
holding that confiscation of property is not a punishment and
therefore, Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India is not
attracted. It was further held that the property of an accused
facing trial under 1988 Act could be attached and there can be
administration by third party of the said property and eventual
forfeiture after conviction. It was further held that an accused

                                   20
has no vested right as regards the interim measure and he is not
protected by any constitutional right to advance the plea that he
cannot be made liable to face confiscation proceedings of the
property which has been accumulated, by illegal means. It was
further held that the filament of reasoning has to rest in favour
of confiscation and not against it and that the provision does not
violate any constitutional assurance. It was further held that
section 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act targets the persons who have
disproportionate assets to their known sources of income. This
conceptually is a period offence, for it is not incident specific as
such. It does not require proof of corruption in specific acts, but
has reference to the assets accumulated and known sources of
income in a particular period. The test applicable and proof
required is different. It was further held that in the context of the
2006 Act, it is associated with high public office or with political
office which are occupied by people who control the essential
dynamics of power which can be a useful weapon to amass
wealth adopting illegal means.
11.          The delinquent officers holding high public or political
office having disproportionate assets coming within the purview
of section 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act have to face trial in the Special
Court established under section 3 of 2006 Act and they are also

                                  21
to face the confiscation proceedings as provided under Chapter
III of the 2006 Act before the authorised officer subject to
judicial scrutiny. If the accused persons having disproportionate
assets coming within section 5(1)(e) of 1947 Act are taken out of
the purview of the said confiscation proceedings as contended by
the learned counsel for the appellant then there would be
unreasonable classification between the two sets of accused
persons facing trial before the Special Court, one under section
13(1)(e) of 1988 Act and the other under section 5(1)(e) of 1947
Act. They face similar nature of accusation of accumulation of
disproportionate assets to their known sources of income before
the same Court but for different period. Creating a micro-mini
classification between them on the basis of period of commission
of offence would not be conducive in the interest of justice rather
it would frustrate the very purpose of existence of confiscation
proceeding     in 2006    Act. By   enactment     of  2006   Act,  a
classification has already been made between the persons
holding high public or political office than other persons having
accusation of accumulation of disproportionate assets. The
holders of high public or political office enjoy a distinguished
position in contrast to other categories of officers or post holders
and they form a separate class altogether and therefore, the

                                 22
legislature with regard to their position has put them in a
different class. By making further classification amongst the
separate class of persons holding high public or political office on
the basis of years of accumulation of disproportionate assets
would be unfair and unreasonable.        Such an approach would
neither be based on any intelligible differentia nor would have
any rational reason to the object sought to be achieved by 2006
Act. A person holding high public or political office in the State of
Orissa at any point of time in respect of whom a prosecution
under section 5(1)(e) of 1947 Act has already been instituted
and pending in the Special Court cannot escape from the rigour
of the confiscation proceeding as provided under Chapter III of
the 2006 Act merely because disproportionate assets were
accumulated prior to coming of 1988 Act. When an accused
holding high public or political office and charge sheeted under
section 5(2) read with section 5(1)(e) of 1947 Act has to face
trial in the Special Court as established under the provisions of
2006 Act as has been done in the case of the appellant by
publishing notification in the Extraordinary Orissa Gazette and
such declaration was held to be constitutionally valid and
Chapter III of 2006 Act providing for confiscation of property or
money or both was held not to be violative either of Articles 14,

                                         23
20(1) or Article 21 of the Constitution of India by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case of Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal (supra), I
am of the humble view that the learned Authorised Officer,
Special Court, Bhubaneswar has not committed any illegality in
rejecting the petition filed by the appellant as per the impugned
order dated 21.12.2011.
12.              Accordingly, the Criminal Appeal being devoid of
merits, stands dismissed.
                                                 ...…………………………
