          PRESENT:
                             THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M. M. DAS
          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. DAS,J.                  This Appeal has been preferred by the appellant
          under section 24 (C) of the Orissa Education Act, 1969
          (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) impugning the judgment
          passed by the State Education Tribunal, Orissa, Bhubaneswar
          in G.I.A. Case No. 135 of 2006 on 11.9.2009.

                             2
2.           Facts of the case reveal that the Chrome Nagar
Bidyapitha at Ferrochrome Plant, Jajpur Road in the district of
Jajpur was established and accorded recognition in the year
1985-86. Thus, it became a recognized educational institution
as defined under section 3 (p) of the Act. Both the appellant
and respondent no. 5 claimed to have been appointed in the
said school as T.G. (PCM) teachers.        After the school was
notified to be an aided educational institution on 6.5.1995 with
effect from 1.6.1995, the Managing Committee of the school
vide its resolution dated l5.10.1995 resolved to sent the name of
the teachers of the said school for approval in the prescribed
proforma basing on the date of joining of the said teachers
chronologically and discipline-wise.      Accordingly, the staff
position was submitted by the Managing Committee of the
school before the Inspector of Schools on 13.10.1995. The
Inspector of Schools struck down the name of the appellant on
the ground that he was not appointed against any sanctioned
post and no more post was admissible to the school as per the
prescribed yardstick dated 8.7.1981. Upon coming to know of
the same, the appellant made a representation to the Inspector
of Schools. The Inspector of Schools referred the matter for
approval of service to the Director of Secondary Education,
Orissa vide his letter dated 24.11.1995 mentioning therein that
the respondent no. 5 was appointed against the post of T.G.

                           3
(PCM) teacher and she has undergone B.Ed. training as an in-
service teacher. It was further mentioned by him that the
appellant – Raghunath Mishra, was appointed as a teacher on
1.9.1989 after the appointment of the respondent no. 5 when
there was no post for him in the standard staffing pattern as
per the yardstick. The Deputy Director (NGS) by his letter dated
19.7.1997 directed the Inspector of Schools to give approval to
the service of the appellant as he is senior on the basis of date
of passing of the B.Ed. examination.     Being aggrieved by the
non-approval of service, the respondent no. 5 approached this
Court in OJC No. 869 of 1996. This Court vide order dated
8.11.2006 disposed of the said writ petition directing the
respondent no. 5 to file a G.I.A. Case in the State Education
Tribunal, pursuant to which, the aforesaid G.I.A. Case was filed
by the respondent no. 5 before the Tribunal.
3.           The case of the respondent no. 5 before the
Tribunal was that one Sabita Guru, who was appointed as T.G.
(PCM) teacher in the school on 9.7.1984, submitted her
resignation letter on 6.7.1989, which was accepted by the
Managing Committee on 13.7.1989. The said post having fallen
vacant, the Managing Committee of the school made an
advertisement for appointment of teacher to the said post and
also sought for names from the Employment Exchange. In
pursuance of the said advertisement, the appellant, the

                           4
respondent no. 5 and other five candidates made applications
for appointment. The respondent no. 5 having M.Sc. in
Mathematics qualification as well as teaching experience was
selected in the selection test conducted by the Managing
Committee on the basis of higher qualification and teaching
experience. As per the resolution of the Managing Committee
dated 13.7.1989, it was resolved to give appointment to the
respondent no. 5 in the post of T.G. (PCM) teacher on a
consolidated salary of Rs. 950/-. Pursuant to the said
resolution, an appointment letter was issued to the respondent
no. 5 on 15.7.1989 by the Secretary of the Managing Committee
and the respondent no. 5 joined in the said post on 17.7.1989.
The appointment of respondent no. 5 was never challenged by
the present appellant though he was not selected. After joining
the school against the T.G. (PCM) post, the school mentioned in
the “Recognition Form” for the year 1989-90 the name of the
respondent no. 5 as a teacher in T.G. (PCM) post and submitted
the same before the Educational Authorities on 29.71989 which
was accepted by the said authorities and further recognition to
the school was granted in the year 1989-90. The respondent no.
5 also underwent in-service B.Ed. training in Utkal University
being sponsored by the Managing Committee of the School
while in service and appeared the B.Ed. examination in
September, 1990 and was declared successful when the result

                           5
was published on 20.5.1991. It was the further case of the
respondent no. 5 that the appellant was appointed without any
resolution of the Managing Committee when there was no
vacancy at all in the school and the appointment letter was
issued by the Secretary and the Headmaster of the School on
22.8.1989 to the appellant appointing him as an additional
teacher in the school with a consolidated salary of Rs. 900/-
when there was no sanctioned post available as per the
yardstick of the year 1981. Further, no prior permission from
the educational authority was taken to give such appointment
to the appellant. The appellant joined in the school on 1.9.1989
as an additional teacher without approval. It was also alleged by
the respondent no. 5 that after long time, the Secretary behind
the back of the Managing Committee inserted a resolution in
the resolution book of the Managing Committee on 18.5.1990.
4.           The appellant’s case before the Tribunal was that
the respondent no. 5, who was the applicant before the
Tribunal, had no training qualification and it cannot be said
that she was appointed to a Trained Graduate post. After Sabita
Guru submitted her resignation, the respondent no. 5 was
appointed as a Science Teacher for urgent requirement of the
school, as the academic session has already started by then. He
further asserted that since a qualified trained teacher was to be
appointed as against the admissible post of Sabita Guru, the

                             6
appellant, pursuant to the advertisement made application
along with others and faced interview and got the appointment
on being selected on 21.8.1989. He joined the school on
1.9.1989.
5.            The Tribunal after noting the pleadings of each of
the parties and the facts of the case entered into the disputed
question as to whether the respondent No.5, who was the
applicant before the Tribunal, can be held to have been
appointed to a Trained Graduate Teacher (PCM) post without
training qualification. Relying upon the decision in the case of
Bibekananda Das v. State of Orissa and others, 1997 (II)
OLR 122, the learned Tribunal ultimately held that the
application filed by the respondent No.5 should be allowed and
accordingly passed orders allowing the said application by
quashing the approval of the present appellant-opposite party
No.5    and further directing the     approval of the applicant’s
service   (respondent no. 5) against the post of TGT (PCM) of
Chrome Nagar Bidyapitha at Ferro Chrome Plant under Jajpur
Education Circle with effect from 20.5.1991 and to release the
grant-in-aid in her favour with effect from 1.6.1994.     It was
further directed that the said order shall be complied with
within a period of three months.
6.            It is an admitted case that both the appellant and
the respondent no. 5 were appointed prior to 1990 but when the

                            7
respondent no. 5 was appointed, he did not acquire the B.Ed.
qualification by that date.
7.           In the case of Bibekananda Das (Supra), this Court
laid down that if a teacher is appointed as against a TGT post
though he was untrained before the school became an aided
school, there was no bar for such appointment in such a non-
Government High School under the prescribed rules and his
appointment cannot be disapproved merely because he did not
possess the training qualification.     In the present case, the
school became aided with effected from 1.6.1995 and the
respondent no. 5 also acquired the training qualification as an
in-service   candidate   being   sponsored    by  the   Managing
Committee, in 1991. Hence, the appointment of respondent no.
5 could not have been disapproved. This Court, therefore, finds
that the Tribunal has not committed any error in passing the
impugned judgment.      The said judgment, therefore, does not
require any interference of this Court in this appeal.
8.            The FAO being devoid of merit is accordingly
dismissed.
