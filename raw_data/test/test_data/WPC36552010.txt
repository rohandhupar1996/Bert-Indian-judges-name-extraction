                            For the respondents: Mr. U.K. Goswami,
                                                    SC, Second. Edu. Deptt.
                            Date of Hearing :       04-08-2015
                            Date of Judgment:        25-08-2015
                               JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
                In this writ petition, the petitioner is challenging the termination of
        his service and seeking payment of his salaries, past and present as he
        continues to discharge his duties in the post of Assistant Teacher of
        Lakhipur Higher Secondary School.
        2.      The facts of the case, as pleaded by him, in a nutshell, are that he
        is a post graduate in Assamese and is eligible to be appointed as Subject
        Teacher. He had applied for the post of Assistant Teacher in the year
        1999, was called for the interview, appeared before the Interview Board
        and was selected whereafter the respondent No. 8 issued the order dated
        30-11-1999 appointing him as senior Hindi Teacher of Lakhipur Higher
        Secondary School in the pay scale of ₹3,580-8750 pm plus other
        admissible allowances against the lien vacancy of one Mohammad Abu
        Taleb, senior Hindi Teacher of the same school. He joined the post on 1-
        12-1999 and discharged his duty thereafter. His post was subsequently
        converted into General post vice one Chakreshwar Kakati a retired A/T
        and transferred to the same school vide the order dated 17-6-2003 and
WP(C) No. 3655/2010                                                                  Page 2 of 8

        joined the post on 7-7-2003. However, he received his salary only up to
        November, 2003 whereafter payment of his salary was suddenly stopped.
        He then submitted his representation dated 7-4-2004 to the respondent
        No. 8 for release of his withheld salaries through his Principal. The
        respondent No. 8 thereafter referred the representation of the petitioner to
        the respondent No. 6 for necessary action. Another representation dated
        19-11-2004 was also submitted by him to the respondent No. 8 seeking
        redressal of his grievances. In the meantime, the respondent No. 8
        informed the petitioner through the communication dated 13-4-2005 that
        interview for the vacant posts of Post Graduate Secondary Teachers for the
        same school would be held on 20-4-2005 in the Office of the respondent
        No. 6 and asked him to appear in the said interview. He duly appeared in
        the interview, but the fate of this interview is not known till now. In the
        meanwhile, he approached this Court in WP(C) No. 49/2006 praying for
        release of his salaries from December, 2003 including current salary. This
        Court by the order dated 6-4-2006 disposed of the writ petition directing
        that all the matters pertaining to payment of salaries should be referred to
        the Expert Committee constituted for the purpose.
        3.      In the meantime, another advertisement was published in the
        newspaper on 25-8-2007 inviting application for the posts of post
        graduate teachers in provincialized Higher Secondary Schools. He duly
        applied for one of such posts and appeared in the selection process but
        nothing came out of this selection process. In the meanwhile, the said
        Expert Committee constituted a Sub-Committee headed by the respondent
        No. 8. The petitioner appeared before the Sub-Committee which ultimately
        submitted its report holding that the adjustment of the petitioner against
        the regular vacancy was without any selection and his appointment was,
        as such, irregular and that his pay due from December, 2003 up to the
        date when his service was terminated should be released. The Expert
        Committee     in  its  meetings   held on   19-11-2008    and   25-11-2008
        recommended the termination of his service and payment of his salary for
        the period actually served. The respondent No. 6 then issued the order
        dated 7-7-2009 terminating his service. The respondent No. 8, however, by
WP(C) No. 3655/2010                                                               Page 3 of 8

        the letter dated 24-7-2009 sought for modification of the said termination
        order against which the respondent No. 6 sought for clarification from the
        respondent No. 8 vide his letter dated 5-9-2009. On the basis of the
        clarification furnished by the respondent No. 8, the respondent No. 6
        referred the case of the petitioner to the State Government for examination
        and necessary action. However, the State Government by the letter dated
        31-5-2010 conveyed through the respondent No. 5 that its regret fir its
        inability to reconsider the case of the petitioner rejected his claim. The
        petitioner claims that he is yet to receive any order of his termination from
        service till now and is still discharging his duty till now. In the meantime,
        he was appointed as Scrutiniser of Data Capture Format under RMSA,
        Goalpara with effect from 30-10-2009. He is, therefore, aggrieved by the
        action of the State-respondent in extracting his service without paying his
        salaries till now.
        4.      The writ petition is opposed by the State-respondents, who, through
        the respondent No. 6, filed their counter-affidavit. It is asserted by the
        answering respondent that the petitioner is unable to produce any
        document to show that he was selected in the year 1999: he merely stated
        that he temporarily appointed as Hindi Teacher against a lien vacancy
        because of which he prayed for conversion to the post of Assistant Teacher
        (Craft-in-Tailoring) which fell vacant w.e.f. 31-8-2002. He was, however,
        called for interview for the post of Post Graduate Teacher in the year 2005
        in pursuance of the letter dated 13-4-2005 of the Inspector of Schools,
        which is illegal as the said interview was meant only for regularly selected
        teachers having post graduate degree. According to the answering
        respondent, he was illegally converted to the general Assistant Teacher
        post without following any rules and procedure and could not, therefore,
        claim salaries for that post. The case of the petitioner along with other
        similarly situated cases were referred to the Expert Committee in
        pursuance of the order dated 6-4-2006, the Committee rejected his case
        and recommended termination of his service immediately. The committee,
        however, recommended payment of his salary w.e.f. December, 2003 till
        the date of termination of his service. The service of the petitioner was
WP(C) No. 3655/2010                                                                 Page 4 of 8

        accordingly terminated by the order dated 7-7-2009 of the respondent No.
        6. His prayer for payment of salary for the service rendered by him in the
        past was duly considered by the Government, but the same was rejected
        vides the letter dated 31-5-2010 of the Under Secretary, Education
        Department, Government of Assam. It is submitted by the answering
        respondent that in view of several pronouncement of the law made by the
        Apex Court as well as this Court, if the initial appointments are contrary
        to the statutory rules, such appointments do not confer any right on the
        appointees to claim salary from public exchequer or regularization of
        service. In the instant case, according to the answering respondents, since
        the petitioner was illegally appointed to the post of Assistant Teacher, he is
        not entitled to receive any salary. The answering respondent, therefore,
        contends that the writ petition, being devoid of merit, is liable to be
        dismissed.
        5.      The petitioner filed his reply affidavit wherein he claims that the
        respondents have been utilizing his service even after the filing the writ
        petition by him. He was associated with the Assembly election process in
        the year 2011 and was asked to fill up his Identity Card. His order of
        appointment dated 30-3-2011 would show that he was appointed as the
        Presiding Officer. On 27-5-2011, he was entrusted with the duty of KRP of
        RMSA, Goalpara by the Inspector of Schools, GDC, Goalpara. On 16-11-
        2011, the Principal of Lakhimpur H.S.S. School was informed about the
        deputation of the petitioner in connection with the selection of Post-Matric
        and Pre-Matric Scholarship for the minority students of Goalpara district.
        He was deputed from KPP training by the District Programme Coordinator-
        cum-Inspector of Schools, Goalpara vide the order dated 21-5-2012. He
        was engaged in the Laptop distribution ceremony to meritorious students
        vide the order dated 21-9-2012 and was also asked to attend SMDC
        training scheduled w.e.f. 20-12-2012 to 12-1-2013 vide the order dated
        17-12-2012. By the order dated 20-2-2014 issued by the Inspector of
        Schools, GDC, Goalpara, he was entrusted with the task of coordination
        during the distribution of Note Book Computer Set under the Chief
        Minister Special Award-2013 to meritorious students securing 2nd Division
WP(C) No. 3655/2010                                                                 Page 5 of 8

        of certain percentage of marks. Thus, according to the petitioner, as his
        services has been and is still utilized by the respondent-authorities, he is
        entitled to salaries for the services rendered by him.
        6.      The basic contention of Mr. M. Dutta, the learned counsel for the
        petitioner, is that since the petitioner has been uninterruptedly rendering
        service to the State-respondents from December, 2003 till now, he is not
        only entitled to past and current salaries but also regularization of his
        service considering the number of years of service already rendered by him
        in different capacities. He, further, submits that the Expert Committee
        wrongly recommended termination of his service on the mistaken
        assumption that he was not appointed after undergoing due selection
        process. Per contra, Mr. U.K. Goswami, the learned standing counsel for
        the Education (Secondary) Department, Assam, strenuously argues that
        when the petitioner could not show that he was initially appointed in
        accordance with the recruitment rules by undergoing due process of
        selection, the question of his entitlement to salaries for the service
        rendered by him does not and cannot arise: if an order is bad in its
        inception, it does not get sanctioned at a later stage. He maintains that the
        concept of adverse possession of lien on post or holding over is not
        applicable to service jurisprudence and continuation of a person wrongly
        appointed on post does not create any right in his favour. To fortify his
        submissions, he relies on the decision of the Apex Court in State of
        Orissa v. Mamata Mohanty, (2011) 3 SCC436.
        7.      The pleadings of the rival parties and the arguments advanced by
        their respective counsels have been carefully examined by me. At the
        outset, I cannot but observe that there is absolutely no evidence to show
        that the petitioner was appointed as Assistant Teacher at any given time
        by undergoing due process of recruitment conducted by the State-
        respondents. From his initial appointment order itself, it can be seen that
        he was merely appointed against the lien vacancy of the incumbent (one
        Abu Tuleb, Senior Hindi Teacher of Lakhipur Higher Secondary School)
        and his period of appointment was co-terminus with the return of the
WP(C) No. 3655/2010                                                                Page 6 of 8

        incumbent to his original post, namely, the temporarily post held by the
        petitioner. Again, the order dated 17-6-2003 issued by the Inspector of
        Schools, GDC, Goalpara indicates that it was on his own request, the post
        held by him was converted into General post (whatever that may mean)
        and was transferred (??) in the same school in his own grade vice one
        Chakreshwar Kakati, who had retired from service. In my opinion, the
        kind of appointment claimed by the petitioner on the basis of the aforesaid
        orders, to say the least, confused and confounded me and is possibly
        unknown in the service jurisprudence. All that I can say is that the initial
        appointment and the subsequent appointment of the petitioner to the post
        of Assistant Teacher were never made in accordance with the recognized
        recruitment process and were made de hors the rules and are,
        accordingly, void ab initio. The question as to whether such illegal
        appointment can confer the right to claim salary for the service rendered
        and seek regularization of such service have come up for consideration
        before the Apex Court in Mamata Mohanty case (supra) and was decided
        in the following manner:
                    “36. Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition that no person
                can be appointed even on a temporary or ad hoc basis without
                inviting applications from all eligible candidates. If any appointment
                is made by merely inviting names from the employment exchange or
                putting a note on the notice board, etc. that will not meet the
                requirement of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Such a
                course violates the mandates of Articles 14 and 16 of the
                Constitution of India as it deprives the candidates who are eligible
                for the post, from being considered. A person employed in violation
                of these provisions is not entitled to any relief including salary. For
                a valid and legal appointment mandatory compliance with the said
                constitutional requirement is to be fulfilled. The equality clause
                enshrined in Article 16 requires that every such appointment be
                made by an open advertisement as to enable all eligible persons to
                compete on merit.
                Order bad in inception
WP(C) No. 3655/2010                                                                  Page 7 of 8

                           37. It is a settled legal proposition that if an order is bad in its
                      inception, it does not get sanctified at a later stage. A subsequent
                      action/development cannot validate an action which was not lawful
                      at its inception, for the reason that the illegality strikes at the root
                      of the order. It would be beyond the competence of any authority to
                      validate such an order. It would be ironic to permit a person to rely
                      upon a law, in violation of which he has obtained the benefits. If an
                      order at the initial stage is bad in law, then all further proceedings
                      consequent thereto will be non est and have to be necessarily set
                      aside. A right in law exists only and only when it has a lawful
                      origin. (Vide Upen Chandra Gogoi v. State of Assam16, Mangal
                      Prasad Tamoli v. Narvadeshwar Mishra 17 and Ritesh Tewari v.
                      State of U.P.18)
                           38. The concept of adverse possession of lien on post or holding
                      over are (sic) not applicable in service jurisprudence. Therefore,
                      continuation of a person wrongly appointed on post does not create
                      any right in his favour. [Vide M.S. Patil (Dr.) v. Gulbarga
                      University 19.]
            8.        For the reasons stated in the foregoing, there is no merit in this writ
            petition, which is, therefore, dismissed, but by directing the parties to bear
            their respective costs.
                                                                                    JUDGE
