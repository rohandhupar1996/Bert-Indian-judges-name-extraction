I.M.QUDDUSI, J.         This writ petition has been filed against the judgment
     and order dated 9th February, 2000 passed by the Central
     Administrative Tribunal, Cuttack Bench dismissing O.A. No.420 of
     1992.
     2.                 The brief facts of the case are that while the petitioner
     was serving as E.D.D.A. at Jayapur Branch Office, a disciplinary
     proceeding was initiated against him. Consequently, charge-sheet
     was served upon him in which three charges were levelled, which are
     as under:
                        “Article-I. That Sri Bata Krishna Nayak while
                        working as EDDA Jaypur EDBO in a/c with

                Mandarmal on the M.O. paid voucher on
                21.9.88 as identifier/witness respectively and
                thereby committed grave misconduct.
                Article-II. That Sri Batakrishna Nayak while

                Basanti Swain and thereby committed grave
                misconduct.
               Article-III. That Sri Batakrishna Nayak while
               working as EDDA- Jaypur BO on 24.9.88
               showed payment of Sadhana Ausodhalaya MO
               No.3503 dtd. 20.9.88 for Rs.100/- p/t Sri
               Mayadhar Bhoi vill-Itagari, P.O. Jaypur an
               illeterate payee obtaining forged signature of
               the payee on the MO paid voucher and bogus
               signature of Sri Krushna Chandra Raut as
               witness thereon and thereby committed grave
               misconduct.”
After conclusion of the departmental proceeding, the petitioner was
awarded punishment of removal from service vide impugned order
dated 30.11.1991 passed by the Sub-Divisional Inspector (Postal),
Bhadrak East Sub-Division, Bhadrak.        Thereafter, he preferred a
departmental appeal on 3.1.1992 to the Superintendent of Post
Offices, Bhadrak Division, Bhadrak. When the appeal was not
disposed of even after expiry of six months, he filed the Original
Application before the Tribunal on 12.08.1992 with a prayer for
quashing the memo of charges and the order of punishment passed
by   the  disciplinary   authority,  and  for  his consequential    re-
instatement with service benefits. During the pendency of the O.A.,
the appellate authority, i.e., the Superintendent of Post Offices,
considered the matter and passed orders to the effect that after going

                               3
through all the relevant records, findings of the I.O. and of the
Disciplinary Authority, he was not in agreement with the said
findings. The Disciplinary Authority was directed to initiate de novo
proceedings from the stage of examination of those S.Ws. who were
not examined in respect of Article of Charge No.I and also to collect
the opinion of G.E.Q.D. in respect of Article of Charge Nos.II and III.
In pursuance of that order, the Disciplinary Authority vide order
dated 10.02.1994 ordered that a de novo proceeding would be
conducted from the stage mentioned above in respect of Charge Nos. I
and II only. It was informed to the petitioner that no further enquiry
would be held in respect of Article of Charge No. III as the main
witness of that charge, who was Sadhana Aushdhalaya, was reported
to be dead. But, as his O.A. was already pending before the Tribunal,
the petitioner did not participate in the de novo enquiry, resulting
which the Disciplinary Authority, vide order dated 27.01.2000
imposed punishment of dismissal from service. The Tribunal
dismissed the O.A. of the petitioner, inter alia, with the observation
that the order of the appellate authority has no legal consequence
because, under section 19(4) of the Administrative Tribunals Act,
order on the appeal, if any, passed by the appellate authority abates.
Further, the Tribunal considered the initial order of punishment of
removal from service dated 30.11.1991 and held that charge No.I was
established against the petitioner, and even if it is presumed that
charge Nos. II and III could not be proved, the imposition of
punishment of removal from service is in no way disproportionate to
the gravity of charge No.I.
4.               Before proceeding further, it is necessary to peruse
the provisions of section 19(4) of the Administrative Tribunals Act,
1985.   For    convenience,   the  said    provisions are  reproduced
hereunder:-
                 “19. Applications to Tribunals.
                  xx                    xx                 xx
                  (4) Where an application has been admitted
                 under Sub-section (3), every proceeding under
                 the relevant service rules as to redressal of
                 grievances in relation to the subject-matter of

                                 4
                  such application pending immediately before
                  such admission shall abate and save as
                  otherwise directed by the Tribunal, no appeal or
                  representation in relation to such matter shall
                  thereafter be entertained under such rules.”
5.                No doubt, in view of the above-quoted provisions, all
proceedings pending with the departmental authority stand abated
after the admission of the Original Application by the Tribunal, which
was admitted on 28.01.1992 and notice was also issued. But, if the
higher authority had passed an order directing de novo enquiry for
certain reasons disagreeing with the proceeding and punishment
order, the same should have been treated as part of the pleadings of
the opposite parties, and in such circumstances the Tribunal should
have treated it as admission of the opposite parties regarding lacuna
in disciplinary proceedings, as it was binding upon them. The
Superintendent of Post Offices in the said order dated 11.11.1992
had pointed out that in respect of Charge of Article No.I, specimen
L.T.Is. (Ext.S-4) were sent for opinion to the G.E.Q.D. with the
disputed document, i.e., L.T.Is. But, the person whose L.T.Is. were
obtained and marked as Ext.S-4 was not examined to prove his L.T.I.
Ext.S-4 neither bore any identification nor witnessed by any one. The
document (Ext.S-4) was attested by a person who was working under
the Investigating Officer and thus was a part and parcel of the
investigating team. Further, he did not know the name of the
husband of the payee nor the name and village of her father. He was
also not a resident of the village of the payee nor was the village of the
payee within the delivery jurisdiction of the branch office of that
person. When Ext.S-4 itself was disputed, how could it be treated as
admitted without getting it proved? Therefore, it could not have been
said that the Charge of Article No.I was proved beyond doubt. More
so, when the opposite parties in their counter affidavit have stated
that it is a fact that the payee whose L.T.Is. were taken in Ext.S-4 did
not attend the enquiry. The order of the appellate authority was also
mentioned in paragraph-6 of the counter affidavit wherein it has been
stated that the appellate authority was not convinced with the

                                        5
       findings of the I.O., and, therefore, de novo proceedings were ordered.
       It has also been stated that since de novo proceedings were ordered
       by the appellate authority, the case would be decided by the
       Disciplinary Authority on completion of the de novo proceedings on
       its merit. Therefore, the Tribunal had no occasion to consider the
       merits of the case vis-a-vis the impugned order of punishment of
       removal from service in view of the admission of the opposite parties
       that the matter required de novo enquiry. Further, since the
       Superintendent of Post Offices admitted the lacuna in the enquiry
       proceedings and decided to hold de novo enquiry, the impugned order
       of removal from service was liable to be set aside. During the
       pendency of the O.A. before the Tribunal, the opposite parties could
       not have started de novo proceedings. Therefore, the de novo
       proceedings started and decided ex parte and the order passed on
       that basis is null and void in view of section 19(4) of the
       Administrative Tribunals Act.
       6.              In    view    of   the   above-mentioned      facts    and
       circumstances, the impugned judgment and order passed by the
       Tribunal is not sustainable in the eye of law and the same is
       quashed. The order of punishment of removal from service dated
       30.11.1991 as well as the order of dismissal from service passed on
       27.01.2000 after holding de novo ex parte enquiry during the
       pendency of the O.A. before the Tribunal, is also quashed. It will be
       open for the opposite parties to initiate fresh disciplinary proceedings
       against the petitioner, if so advised.
       7.              In the result, the writ petition is allowed. There will be
       no order as to costs.
