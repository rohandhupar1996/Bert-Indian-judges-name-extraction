                                               BEFORE
                              THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE B.K. SHARMA
Date of hearing & Judgement:                       18/08/2015
                       JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
1.      Heard Mr. M.U. Mandal, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Mr.
B. J. Ghosh, learned State Counsel and so also Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned ASGI. I
have also perused the entire materials on record including the records received
from the Tribunal.
2.      The matter pertains to the opinion rendered by the Foreigners Tribunal
(1st), Morigaon in case No. FT (C) 833/2006 (Police reference No.
401/2000) (Sate of Assam Vs. Mustt. Farida Khatun). By the said order,
the petitioner has been declared to be a foreigner as she failed to discharge her
burden of proof as envisaged under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.
3.      As will be evident from the impugned order, all the documents submitted
by the petitioner were only photocopies. Needless to say that such photocopies
of documents are inadmissible in evidence. That apart, as discussed in the
impugned order and also discernible from the evidence on record, the petitioner
herself stated that the house of her father Foizuddin was at Hatipara Gaon
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                            Page 2 of 9

under Rupohi Police Station, but photocopies of voter lists incorporating the
name of Foizuddin indicate that he was a voter of Dakhin Khatowal village.
As has been recorded in the order of the Tribunal, not a single document could
be proved by the petitioner as required under the Law of Evidence.
4.      As per the evidence of prosecution witnesses i.e. PW-1 and PW-2,
during investigation by the Police the petitioner failed to produce any valid
document to prove her Indian citizenship. PW-3 in his deposition stated that
during investigation it was revealed that the petitioner came to India (Assam) for
livelihood after the cut-off date i.e. 25/03/1971 from Village and Post Office
Chailakura in the district of Syllhet. The petitioner in her deposition stated that
Foizuddin is her father and his house was in the Village Chatipara under Police
Station Rupohi. On the other hand, OPW-2 examined by her stated that the
house of Foizuddin was at Dakhin Khatowal and that he was born and
brought up at Dakhin Khatowal.
5.      Mr. M.U. Mandal, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that along
with the photocopies of documents, the petitioner also produced the originals i.e.
the certified copies. He further submits that even the photocopies being the
copies of the certified copies of the documents are admissible in evidence.
According to him, the petitioner having produced the photocopies of the certified
copies of the documents, she had duly discharged her burden of proof as
envisaged under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946. He also submits that
the documents being public documents, there was no necessity to produce the
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                             Page 3 of 9

certified copies thereof. In this connection, he has placed reliance on the
following judgements :
            1. 2012 (1) SCC 425 – (Jasw ant Singh Vs. Gurdev Singh and
            others);
            2. 2013 (4) SCC 97 – (Lax m ibai (dead) through LR s and
            another Vs. Bhagw antbuva (dead) through LR s and others);
            3. AIR 1963 SC 1633 – M adam anchi R am appa and another
            Vs. M uthaluru Bojjappa) ; and
            4. 2013 (1) GLT 809- (State of Assam Vs. M oslem M ondal
            and others ).
6.       Both Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned ASGI and Mr. B.J. Ghosh, learned State
Counsel submit that the above argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner
is totally misplaced. They submit that the photocopies of the documents are not
admissible in evidence and that too when the same were not exhibited and
proved as per the Law of Evidence.
7.       Section 62 and 63 of the Evidence Act define Primary Evidence and
Secondary Evidence. Certified copies given under the provisions of the Act,
although are secondary evidence and required to be proved by primary evidence
but as indicated in Section 64 and 65 of the Act, there are exception to the
said Rule. That apart, under Section 77 of the Evidence Act, 1872, certified
copies of documents may be produced in proof of the contents of the public
documents and under Section 79, the Court is required to presume as to the
genuineness of the certified copies.
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                           Page 4 of 9

8.       In the instant case, although the petitioner has contended that certified
copies of the documents had been produced and exhibited in reference to the
certified copies, but the same is not discernible from records. The photocopies of
the documents produced by the petitioner are not available in the record. There
is nothing to show that at any point of time, the petitioner had produced the
certified copies. The documents were not exhibited and proved as required under
the Law of Evidence.
9.       As has been held by the Apex Court in 2010 (4) SCC 491 (LICI Vs.
R am Pal Singh Bisen), under the Law of Evidence also, it is necessary that
contents of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by
secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may amount to
admission of contents but not its truth. Documents having not been produced
and marked as required under the Evidence Act cannot be relied upon by the
Curt. Contents of the document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.
10.      In Ashok Dulichand Vs. M adahavlal Dube and another reported in
(1975) 4 SCC 664 , the Apex Court having found that even no foundation was
laid down by the appellant for leading secondary evidences in the shape of
Photostat copy of the document in question, declined to accept the said
evidence. As in the said case in the instant case also, the petitioner has failed to
explain as to what were the circumstances under which the Photostat copies of
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                              Page 5 of 9

the documents were prepared and who was in possession of the original certified
copies at the time, their Photostat copies were taken.
11.      In the case of Sm t. M anoram a Srivastava and another Vs. Sm t.
Saroj Srivastava reported in AIR 1989 All 117 , it was held that Photostat
copies of documents cannot be allowed in evidence. It is only the certified copies
which can be allowed in evidence. That apart, as discussed above, the petitioner
also failed to prove the contents of the documents.
12.      The decisions on which Mr. M.U. Mandal, learned counsel for the
petitioner has placed reliance have no relevance to the issue in hand. In
M adam anchi R am appa (Supra) the Apex Court held that the document in
question being a certified copy of a public document need not have been proved
by calling a witness. In the instant case, what the petitioner produced were only
photocopies of some documents and not the certified copies. In Jasw ant Singh
(Supra) , the Apex Court was concerned with the compromise decree and as to
whether the compromise (Ext. D3) was admissible in evidence or not. It was
held that the compromise being a part of the decree, became a public document
in terms of Section 74 of the Evidence Act and thus the certified copy thereof
under Section 76 of the Act was admissible in evidence under Section 77 of
the Act. It was held that a certified copy of a public document is admissible in
evidence without being proved by calling witness. Unlike the said case, the
petitioner failed to produce the certified copies.
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                             Page 6 of 9

13.      In Lax m ibai (dead) through LR s (Supra) , the Court was concerned
with    an adoption deed. It was contended the same was not satisfactorily
proved. Having regard to the fact that no attempt was made to challenge the
validity of the said document which was held that the document was valid. I have
failed to understand as to how this case is of any help to the case of the
petitioner.
14.      The petitioner has also placed reliance on the Full Bench decision of this
Court in M oslem M ondal (Supra) particularly para 97 and 99 in which
discussing on fair investigation and fair trial, it has been observed that a
proceedee is required to be provided with all reasonable opportunity and that a
proceedee is required to be provided with certified copy of any public document,
including the copy of the relevant electoral rolls. In the instant case, there is no
allegation of non-supply of certified copies of documents. The issue involved is as
to whether the petitioner could lead and prove in evidence towards discharge of
burden of proof as envisaged under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.
Admittedly, the petitioner did not produce the certified copies of the documents
and only produced the photocopies of the documents. It is in such
circumstances, the Tribunal rightly held that those documents are inadmissible in
evidence.
15.      Even if the photocopies of the documents are considered to have been
compared with the certified copies, although there is no proof of it, even then
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                              Page 7 of 9

also the petitioner     has miserably failed to prove her Indian citizenship
discharging the burden of proof as per Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.
The documents (all photocopies) are, a certificate dated 24/03/2006 by which
the marriage of the petitioner with one Md. Nur Mahammad was certified;
voter list of 2005 containing the name of one Forida Khatun; voter list of
1965 containing the name of one Feizuddin ; voter list of 1970 containing the
same name ; voter list of 1979 containing the name of Forida Khatun etc.
Apart from the fact that in the voter list of 1970 there is over-writing in respect
of serial nos. and name. The petitioner also failed to prove that the name of
Feizuddin is relatable to her as she failed to establish any linkage.
16.     In view of the above, I do not find any ground to interfere with the
impugned order and accordingly the writ petition is dismissed upholding the
impugned judgement and order. Consequently, the Superintendent of Police (B),
Morigaon shall apprehend the petitioner immediately and confine her in the
detention camp till such time she is deported to her country of origin.
17.     Let the matter be listed again after one month so as to submit report by
the Superintendent of Police (B) Morigaon and the Deputy Commissioner,
Morigaon, about the action taken in the terms of this order.
18.     The Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon shall ensure deletion of the name of
the petitioner from the voter list, if any.
WP(C) 1393/2010 oral dated 18/07/15                              Page 8 of 9

19.     Registry shall send down the case records to the learned court below
along with a copy of this judgement and order. A copy of the judgement and
order may also be furnished to Mr. B.J. Ghosh, learned State Counsel for his
immediate necessary follow up action. Copies shall also be sent to the SP(B),
Morigaon and Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon, for their immediate follow up
action.
                                                                       JUDGE
