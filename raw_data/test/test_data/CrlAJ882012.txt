                                                                                     2
                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
(P.K.Saikia,J)
         This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated
16.07.2012, passed by the learned Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No. 92(S-
S)/2008 convicting the appellant, Rafique Ali @ Babu of offence u/s 302 IPC
and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs.
50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) i.d. R I for another 6 (six) months for the
offence aforesaid.
2.       Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment, the
appellant (herein after referred to as the accused person) has preferred this
appeal from jail citing several infirmities in the judgment under challenge.
3.       We have heard Mr. S. Borgohain, learned counsel for the appellant and
also heard Mr. K.A. Mazumdar, learned Addl. PP, appearing for the State
respondent.
4.       The facts necessary for disposal of the present proceeding, in short,
are that on 26.11.2006 at about 6.30 pm, Md. Sarujan Ali (since deceased
herein after referred to as the victim), came to the house of his brother,
namely Rafique Ali and assaulted his wife and daughter. Seeing his daughter
and wife being assaulted by the victim, the accused person herein had driven
his brother out of his house.
5.       However, the victim returned back to the house of the accused person
little later and tried to attack the accused person. Such incident enraged the
accused person for which he attacked the victim with a Naga dao inflicting
injuries on his person for which he died at the place of occurrence itself
instantaneously.
6.       An FIR to that effect on being lodged with O/C, Halowating Police
Station on 26.11.2006, police registered a case vide Halowating PS Case No.
                                                           Crl. A. (J). No. 88 OF 2012

                                                                                    3
64/2006 and ordered investigation. The Officer who was entrusted with the
investigation of the case was one Sri Jiban Ch. Kalita (PW 15).
7.     On being so entrusted with the investigation of the case, Sri Kalita,
visited the PO, conducted inquest on the dead body, sent the same to
hospital for post mortem examination, examined the witnesses, arrested the
accused person and did other things needful and on the conclusion of
investigation, he submitted charge sheet u/s 302 IPC against the accused
person and forwarded him to the Court to stand his trial for the offence
aforesaid.
8.     The learned Magistrate before whom charge was so laid committed the
case to the Court of Session since the offence u/s 302 IPC is exclusively
triable by the Court of Session. On receipt of the case on commitment,
learned Sessions Judge, on hearing the learned counsel for the parties, was
pleased to frame charge u/s 302 IPC and charge, so framed, on being read
over and explained to the accused, he pleaded not guilty and claimed to the
tried.
9.     During trial the prosecution has examined as many as 15 (fifteen)
witnesses including the informant, the IO and the MO. The statement of
accused person u/s 313 CrPC was also recorded. He pleaded guilty. He,
however, did not adduce any evidence.
10.    On conclusion of trial and on hearing the learned counsel for the
parties, learned Sessions Judge was pleased to convict the accused person
u/s 302 IPC and sentenced him to punishment as aforesaid. It is that
judgment which has been assailed in the present appeal.
11.    Mr. S. Borgohain, learned counsel for the appellant, submits that the
evidence on record reveals that on the fateful evening, the accused had killed
his own brother in his house but referring to the evidence, rendered by
various PWs, it has been contended that the accused had to kill his own
                                                          Crl. A. (J). No. 88 OF 2012

                                                                                    4
brother in exercise of right of private defence. Such proposition is found well
evident from the evidence on record and other materials including statement
of the accused person recorded u/s 313 CrPC.
12.     Being so, in view of the materials on record, learned trial Court was
not justified in convicting the accused of offence u/s 302 IPC. Rather, he
ought to have been convicted of offence u/s 304-II IPC. He, therefore, urges
this court to alter the conviction of the accused person from a conviction u/s
302 IPC to a conviction u/s 304-II IPC and sentenced him to punishment
accordingly.
13.     We have also heard Mr. K. A. Mazumdar, learned Addl. PP. Referring
to the evidence of witnesses, more particularly, the evidence of PW 2, Musstt.
Rajina Begum and PW 3, Miss Momina Begum, wife and daughter of the
accused respectively, learned Addl. PP. submits that their evidence reveals
that the accused had to attack, injured and killed the deceased under huge
compulsion and as such, the submission, advanced by the learned counsel for
the appellant, may be accepted.
14.     We have considered the rival submissions having regard to the
evidence on record as well as the judgment under challenge. On a careful
perusal of evidence of witnesses, more particularly, the evidence of PW 2,
Musstt. Regina Begum, PW 3, Miss Momina Begum, we have found that on
the eventful evening, it is the deceased who came to the house of the
accused person in a drunken condition armed with weapons.
15.     Equally important, there is also evidence on record to show that after
going to the house of the accused person, the deceased assaulted the family
members of the accused person. What is worse, he even tried to strangulate
the daughter of the accused person besides assaulting his wife. In such a
situation, the accused had to attack him killing the victim in the house of the
accused person.
                                                          Crl. A. (J). No. 88 OF 2012

                                                                                      5
16.     Such materials further reveal that the accused had to attack the
deceased in exercise of right of private defence to save his daughter and wife
from the assault of the victim but then, in that process, he exceeded the limit
fixed by law and killed his own brother. The medical evidence supports such
a conclusion of us. Situation being such, in our opinion, it is a case of
culpable homicide not amounting to murder and as such, the accused is liable
to be convicted u/s 304-II of the IPC and not under section 302 IPC.
17.     Being so, the judgment in question under which the accused stood
convicted u/s 302 IPC is liable to be interfered with. Accordingly, conviction of
the accused person stands altered from a conviction u/s 302 IPC to a
conviction u/s 304-II IPC.
18.     We have considered the entire material on record and found that a
sentence of 5 (five) years imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 2,000 (Rupees two
thousand) i.d., R I for another 3 (three) months for the aforesaid offence
would meet the end of justice.
19.     In the result, the accused (the appellant herein), is sentenced to suffer
R.I. for 5 (five) years with a fine of Rs. 2,000 (Rupees two thousand) i.d., R.I.
for another 3 (three) months for the offence aforesaid.
20.     The period which the accused has already spent in jail is to be set off
from the period of sentence imposed on him by this Court.
21.     The appeal is partly allowed as indicated above.
22.     The Registry will issue a modified jail warrant as indicated above.
23.     Return the LCR forthwith.
24.     Since the deceased died in a peculiar situation on 26.11.2006 and he
so died leaving behind his wife and minor children, we are of the opinion that
in terms of Section 357A, some amounts needs to be paid to his legal heir(s)
as compensation.
                                                            Crl. A. (J). No. 88 OF 2012

                                                                                   6
25.    Accordingly, we direct the State of Assam to pay an amount to the
tune of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) to the legal heir(s) of the
deceased as being compensation.
26.    The State of Assam is directed to pay such amount to the State Legal
Services Authority (in short, the SLSA) within a period of 3 (three) months
from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment. On the receipt of
such amount, the SLSA shall place such amount at the disposal of the District
Legal Services Authority, Sibsagar.
27.    On the receipt of such amount by DLSA, Sibsagar, same would be
disbursed to the legal heir(s) of the deceased on proper identification.
28.    A copy of this order be furnished to the learned P.P. for doing needful
as indicated above.
