                      JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV)
            The defendant of Title Suit No.195 of 1998 of the Court of learned
Civil Judge (Senior Division) No.1 at Guwahati has preferred this First Appeal
challenging the judgment and decree dated 26.09.2005 thereby, decreeing the
suit for specific performance of contract as to conditions mentioned in Clause-1(i)
to 1(iii) of the written agreement dated 25.08.1992 and also for payment of
Rs.3,00,000/- in cash to the plaintiff within a period of 90 days.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                           Page 1 of 34

[2]           The sole respondent, as plaintiff, instituted the aforesaid title Suit
No.195 of 1998 in the Court learned Civil Judge (Senior Division)No.1 at
Guwahati stating that being an owner in possession of a plot of land measuring 1
B 2K 10L covered by Dag No.913 and 1965 of K.P. Patta No.301 under Vilage
Japorigog under Beltola Mouza of Guwahati, he entered into a registered
agreement with the defendant on 25.08.1992 being registered deed No.5581 of
Guwahati sub-registry agreeing to sell the same land to the defendant on various
terms and conditions. The value of the land was mutually settled at
Rs.20,00,000/- and it was decided that the same amount need not be paid
entirely by cash but the plaintiff would get some amount in cash while in lieu of
cash of the balance sum, he would be given built up area in the proposed multi
storied building after the same is constructed by developing the land. Under
Paragraph-1 of this agreement, it was settled that the plaintiff would get the
following built up area:-
        (i) Half of the built up area on the ground floor of the proposed North
        block of the complex as per the drawing No.GBA/891/03A dated
        14.12.1990 by M/s Gautam Baruwa and Associates;
         (ii) Half of the built up area on the mezzanine floor of the same building;
        and
        (iii) Complete built up area on the first floor in the same building.
[3]           Apart from the aforesaid built up area, the plaintiff would also get an
additional amount in cash and in case of deviation from the drawings the plaintiff
shall always be entitled to the minimum built up area calculated as per the said
drawing and any minor deviation either less or more than this entitlement shall
be adjusted against the amount payable in cash by the defendant to the plaintiff.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                           Page 2 of 34

It was provided further that in the event of failure on the part of the defendant
to fulfill the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff would be at liberty to terminate
the agreement by giving 60 days notice in writing to the defendant and upon
such termination the advance paid by the defendant would stand forfeited. The
plaintiff was entitled to get 12,172 Sq. ft. of built up area in the following
manner:
         (i) Half of the ground floor which is equal to 2669.50 Sq. ft.
         (ii) Half of the mezzanine floor measuring 2372.50 Sq. ft.
          (iii) Complete first floor measuring 7130 Sq.ft. and thus, the plaintiff was
          entitled to a total of 12,172 Sq. ft. of built up area.
[4]            It is further pleaded that till the date of institution of the suit, the
defendant had constructed multi storied building up to 9th floor but allotted 1530
Sq. ft. built up area on the first floor, 1479 Sq. ft. in the mezzanine floor and
4315.11. Sq. ft. built up area in the third floor only. The defendant did nto allow
the plaintiff any built up area in the ground floor and did not allot the first floor in
entirety as earlier agreed and also did not allot the balance area as per the
agreement. At this stage, the defendant took a new plea that built up area as
mentioned in the agreement includes the common areas such as lift well,
corridor, ducts, toilets lobbies etc. The plaintiff did not accept this new definition
and asserted that built up area must be the area within the four walls allotted to
the plaintiff and it should not include any common area. The plaintiff, therefore,
took up the matter with the defendant from time to time and after several talks,
defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff on 9.03.1998 accepting the definition of
the built up area as claimed by the plaintiff and also agreed to allot the
remaining built up area as per the agreement. By issuing a letter subsequently
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 3 of 34

on 16.03.1998, defendant confirmed the aforesaid definition of built up area as
suggested by the plaintiff but projected that the plaintiff is entitled to 8804.77
Sq. ft built up area only out of which 7629.86 Sq. ft. of built up area has already
been handed over. But actually the defendant had allotted only 7324.11 Sq. ft.
and an area of 224.34 Sq. ft. was deducted on account of room No.201 out of
the total built up area of 12172 Sq. ft.
[5]           After several rounds of talks and meetings between the parties, the
plaintiff issued a letter on 11.05.1998 requesting the defendant to allot the
remaining area within one month failing which the agreement would be
terminated and general power of attorney will be revoked. But the defendant
instead of allotting remaining built up area took a different stand than the one
taken in earlier letter dated 09.03.1998 and thereby gave a different meaning of
the words ‘built up area’. As per the said letter, the defendant claimed to have
allotted 2,682.12 Sq. ft. in the first floor, 2586.20 Sq. ft. in the mezzanine floor
and 5278.41 Sq. ft. in the third floor of the building to the plaintiff thereby
claiming that 10,546.73 Sq. ft. of built up area have already been handed over to
the plaintiff. This in addition to the area of 224.34 Sq. ft. in regard to room
No.201 would amount to built up area of 10,771 Sq. ft already handed over and
thus, the plaintiff was entitled to 1400.93 Sq. ft. of built up area only and that
this balance area would be given to the plaintiff in the eighth floor. Aggrieved at
such action of the defendant, plaintiff issued letter dated 16.06.1998 and refuted
all charges alleged by the defendant in the letter dated 08.06.1998 and
demanded balance built up area of 4623.55 Sq. ft. on the remaining floors as per
agreement within 60 days failing which the agreement dated 25.08.1992 would
be deemed to have been terminated after the notice period.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                         Page 4 of 34

[6]         The plaintiff further stated that apart from giving 12,172 Sq. ft. of built
up area in the proposed building, the defendant was supposed to make payment
of Rs.7,00,000/- to the plaintiff out of which he paid a sum of Rs.4,00,00-/- only
and thus, plaintiff was entitled to balance Rs.3,00,000/- with interest @ 12% per
annum since July 1994. The plaintiff, therefore, claimed that he is entitled to a
decree for recovery of money not only of Rs.3,00,000/- as principal but also of
Rs.1,50,000/- towards interest thereon till 22.09.1998. The plaintiff also claimed
future interest @ 12% per annum on the said amount. With these averments the
plaintiff prayed that a decree for specific performance of contract of Clause-1 of
the agreement dated 25.08.1992 referred to above be passed, directing the
defendant to allot balance built up area of 4623.55 Sq. ft. on the ground floor
and the first floor in remaining balance area in the other floors of the North Block
building known as Orion Tower and also for a money decree of Rs.4,50,000/-
along with interest @ 12% per annum from the date of institution of the suit till
realization and a further sum of Rs.20,00,000/- towards compensation for loss of
income due to non-fulfillment of the agreement. He also made a prayer for
prohibitory injunction against the defendant.
[7]         On being summoned the defendant appeared and submitted a written
statement contesting the claim of the plaintiff. Apart from denying the case of
the plaintiff, the defendant took all usual objections like lack of cause of action,
non maintainability of the suit, defect of parties, bar of limitation as well as
proviso to Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act etc. The defendant also raised the
issue that the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree of specific performance without
expressing readiness and willingness to perform his part of contract and that
claim of compensation and future interest cannot be claimed on the allegation of
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 5 of 34

breach of contract. According to the defendant, the plaintiff is not entitled to
injunction as prayed for without making out a clear breach of contract.
[8]              Coming to the merit of the case, the defendant pleaded that the
plaintiff did not hand over 1B 2K 10L of land as claimed in Paragraph-3 of the
plaint and had handed over much less land for which defendant informed the
plaintiff by letter dated 1.10.1992 followed by letter dated 07.06.1993. The land
was re-measured in presence of both sides and thereupon, it came to light that
the land handed over by the plaintiff was 8.35 Lecha less than 1B 2K 10L.
Because of this lesser area of land, the original drawing prepared by Gautom
Baruwa, defendant’s original architect could not be implemented and a new set
of drawing had to be prepared by engaging another architect. However, in view
of Clause-2 of the agreement in regard to deviation of drawing, the interest of
the plaintiff was protected. Thus, the original drawings prepared by Gautom
Baruwa became redundant except for calculating plaintiff’s entitlement as to the
built up area. Plaintiff by letter dated 30.03.1998 acknowledged the same and
admitted that the original drawing had become ‘meaningless’. According to the
defendant, the original agreement dated 25.08.1992 did not quantify the built up
area to be allotted to the plaintiff though claimed in Paragraph-3 of the plaint.
The defendant further claimed that as per universally accepted definition of built
up area in a multi storied building proportionate share of the common area such
as lift well, lobbies, corridors, staircase etc are to be included so that right of
egress and ingress to a premises is guaranteed to the apartment owner and the
same principle has been applied in the present case. The defendant specifically
claimed that in terms of Clause-1 of the agreement the plaintiff and the
defendant jointly made calculation to determine the built up area to be allotted
RFA 38 of 2006                                                        Page 6 of 34

to the plaintiff and in so doing common areas such as staircase, lift well, lobby,
corridors, toilet etc shown in the drawings were taken in to considerations as part
of the built up area and thereupon, it was decided that the plaintiff would be
entitled to 12172 Sq. ft. of built up area. The plaintiff confirmed this calculations
by his letter dated 30.03.1998.
[9]               Referring to the calculation of built up area in each floor as stated
in Paragraph-6 of the plaint, the defendant pleaded that on the body of t he
drawing itself the architect certified the total floor area of the mezzanine floor to
be 440.97 Sq. meter which is equivalent to 4745 Sq. ft. and this includes all
common areas such as staircase, lift wells, lobbies, toilets etc as shown in the
drawing and this is why, the built up area of the mezzanine floor has been shown
to be 2372.50 Sq. ft. by the plaintiff himself. According to the defendant,
examination of all the three drawings which are part of the contract would show
similar result in regard to other three drawings as well. In a sense, plaintiff
himself has confirmed in Paragraph-6 of the plaint that built up area includes the
common areas. Even in Paragraph-2 of the letter dated 25.07.1998 the plaintiff
has accepted the position by referring to Paragarph-2 of the defendant’s letter
dated 08.06.1998. This principle of considering common area as part of the built
up area was accepted by the parties since inception of the project and the
plaintiff all along accepted the same.
[10]               While replying to the statements made in Paragraph-7 & 8 of the
plaint, the defendant stated that in view of handing over 8.35 Lechas less land
than the agreed area of 1B 2K 10L discussions were held between the plaintiff
and the defendant that the earlier drawing had become useless and they
mutually had agreed on allotment of areas on different floors on the basis of the
RFA 38 of 2006                                                             Page 7 of 34

new drawings for the actual constructions and the plaintiff gave his signature in
acknowledgement on 12.04.1994. The defendant confirmed the position in its
letter dated 24.03.1995 while enclosing four drawings with the areas allotted to
the plaintiff clearly marked therein and it was further mentioned that the same
was mutually agreed between the parties. The said letter showed that plaintiff
was being allotted in first floor, mezzanine floor, third floor and eighth floor as
and when the building would be constructed. Even the same letter also contained
in item No.3 that the built up areas allotted to him included common areas and
service areas and most importantly in the last paragraph of the letter it was
specifically mentioned that this agreement superseded all previous agreement
between the two parties and that plaintiff also acknowledge this letter by reply
dated 03.04.1995 without raising any objection. So, the plaintiff had in writing
accepted as follows:
             (i) That his allotment of built up area shall be in the floors designated
        letter dated 24.03.1995;
            (ii) That built up area includes common areas and service areas; and
            (iii) Allotment described in letter dated 24.03.1995 is in complete
        satisfaction of Clause-1(i) to 1(iii) of the original agreement dated
        25.08.1992.
[11]              The defendant further pleaded that the plaintiff was satisfied with
such allotment on the first, mezzanine and third floor is also evidenced by Para-3
of his letter dated 06.03.1993 and this is why he requested the defendant for
giving certificate of ownership in respect to these floors. Moreover, plaintiff
thereafter applied for and obtained holding number with respect to these
premises from Guwahati Municipal Corporation and has been paying taxes for the
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 8 of 34

same. The plaintiff was handed over his entitlement as and when construction
was made and the area handed over is shown in letter dated 24.03.1995. The
plaintiff was given all the shops described in Clause-1(a) at first floor, all the
shops described in Clause-1(b) in the mezzanine floor and the complete floor as
described in Clause 1(c) in the third floor which comes to 10546.73 Sq. ft. for
which plaintiff had already obtained holding number from the GMC. The
defendant assured that balance area would be allotted to the plaintiff in the
eighth floor as and when construction would be made.
[12]             In paragraph-15 of the written statement, the defendant denied
the allegation that a new plea was taken by including the common areas in the
built up areas. The plaintiff had admitted in Para-1 of page-2 of his letter
15.09.1997 that common areas would be included in his allotment vide item
No.1(b), 2(b) and 3(b) and in doing so the plaintiff himself relied on the letters
dated 09.03.1998, 16.03.1998 issued by the defendant as to the entitlement and
allotment of the built up area. However, by letter dated 30.03.1998 the plaintiff
rejected the proposal out right by describing the same as not acceptable but this
part of the matter has not been mentioned in the plaint which amount to
suppression of material fact.
[13]         According to the defendant by letter dated 08.06.1998, plaintiff was
invited to take possession of the balance area in the eighth floor as full and final
settlement of his entitlement as per letter dated 24.3.1995 issued by the
defendant and confirmed by the letter dated 03.04.1995 issued by the plaintiff.
In regard to room No.201, plaintiff was offered at a heavily discounted price as a
gesture of good will for which plaintiff paid a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- on 29.03.1997
and another Rs.1,00,000/- on 2.05.1997. He also paid Rs.50,000/- on 04.02.1998
RFA 38 of 2006                                                        Page 9 of 34

but did not pay the balance Rs.1,40,213/- till date for which it was mutually
agreed that the area of 224.34 Sq. ft. would be adjusted against the total
entitlement of the plaintiff on the eighth floor which he also admitted in his letter
dated 30.03.1998. This is how, the total area handed over to the plaintiff came
to 10771.07 Sq. ft. leaving only 1400.93 Sq. ft. to be handed over to the plaintiff
which would also include proportionate share of the common area in the eighth
floor. The plaintiff was informed that this built up area is ready and available for
possession by the plaintiff at his earliest convenience. The letter dated
08.06.1998 issued by the defendant to the plaintiff explained all these necessary
details. But even thereafter the plaintiff issued the notice on 16.06.1998 which
has been replied by the defendant on 07.07.1998 requesting the plaintiff to
substantiate his claim. This was followed by two letters on 27.07.1998 and
07.08.1998 but the plaintiff did not respond.
[14]              Coming to the claim of money as made in Paragraph-18 of the
plaint, the defendant pleaded that Clause-3 of the agreement dated 25.08.1992
provided for payment of Rs.7,00,000/- in cash out of which Rs.4,00,000/- has
already been received by the plaintiff but the plaintiff in his letter dated
24.03.1995 agreed to contribute Rs.1,00,000/- towards exterior beautification of
the building and thereafter, by letter dated 03.04.1995 plaintiff asked the
defendant to adjust the amount due to him in cash. Even in letter dated
15.09.1997 the same has been confirmed. So far as the balance Rs.2,00,000/- is
concerned, the plaintiff himself informed the defendant by letter dated
07.06.1993 that the amount equivalent to price of land which had fallen short,
shall be deducted from the total amount and the same was mutually agreed to
be Rs.4,00,000/- and this was confirmed by the plaintiff in his letter dated
RFA 38 of 2006                                                         Page 10 of 34

15.09.1997. Therefore, by admission of the plaintiff, he has already taken
Rs.2lakhs more than his entitlement. This being the position the plaintiff is
neither entitled to a decree of specific performance nor is he entitled to get any
money decree from the defendant and so, the suit is liable to be dismissed with
compensatory cost.
[15]           Upon consideration of the pleadings of the parties, the learned trial
court framed as many as 5 issues. But in course of argument the learned counsel
for the defendant claimed that there should be three more issues are liable to be
framed on the point of waiver, acquiescence and estopple and also in view of
provisions of Section 12 and 18 of the Specific relief Act and Section 62 of the
Contract Act. The learned counsel for the plaintiff objected to such reframing of
issues. However, the learned trial court after hearing the parties reframed and
rearranged the issues as follows:-
                   i. Is there any cause of action for the suit?
                   ii. Is the suit bad for non-joinder of necessary parties?
                   iii. Is the suit time barred?
                   iv. Whether the agreement dated 25.08.92 bearing deed No.
                5581 was executed between the plaintiff and the defendant and
                whether as per the said agreement, the defendant is bound to
                deliver to the plaintiff half of the built up area on the ground floor,
                half of the built up area of Mezzanine floor and complete built up
                are on the first floor of the building?
                   v. Is the plaintiff entitled to built up area on 12,172 sq.ft. and is
                entitled to a sum of Rs. 4,50,000/- as claimed in the suit together
                with Rs.20,00,000/-?
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 11 of 34

                  vi. Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form in
                view of provisions of section 12 and 18 respectively of the Specific
                Relief Act, 1963 and Section 62 of the Contract Act?
                  vii. Whether the suit is hit by the principle of waiver,
                acquiescence and estoppel?
                  viii. Whether the agreement dated 25.08.92 is liable to pay
                Specific    Performance by the defendant in view of materials and
                substantial, alteration, modification, substitution and novation
                thereof by subsequent mutual stipulations and acquiescence?
[16]          In course of trial plaintiff examined 2 witnesses including himself.
Plaintiff was examined as PW 1 and architect Gautam Baruwa was examined as
PW 2. PW 1 proved 5 documents as Ext. 1 to Ext. 5 while PW 2 proved only Ext.
6. The sole defendant examined himself as DW 1 and adduced as many as 11
documents as Ext. A to Ext. K. Upon consideration of the evidence on record,
both oral and documentary and upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties,
the learned trial court passed the impugned judgment and decree dated
26.09.2005 and thereupon decreed the suit on contest for Specific Performance
of Clause 1(i) to 1(iii) of the agreement dated 25.08.1992 and to deliver balance
built up area of 4623.55 sq.ft. to the plaintiff as per the condition of aforesaid
clauses of the agreement. The defendant was further directed to deliver
possession of the said area and to execute necessary deeds ‘to effectuate the
allotment’. The learned court passed further decree for payment of Rs.
3,00,000/- to the plaintiff by the defendant within 90 days of the judgment and
order and restrained the defendants from raising further construction on the suit
land and from selling or renting any apartment/roofs/floors etc. till Clause No.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                         Page 12 of 34

1(i) to 1(iii) of the agreement are performed. However, no cost was decreed.
Aggrieved, the sole defendant has preferred this appeal.
[17]         I have heard Mr. DK Mishra, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. PK
Khatoniar on behalf of the appellant defendant and Mr. RC Sancheti, learned
counsel for the respondent plaintiff. No reported or unreported judicial
pronouncement has been relied on by any of the learned counsel. I have perused
the pleadings of the parties and the oral and documentary evidence adduced by
them.
[18]       Mr. DK Mishra, learned senior counsel, has drawn attention of the court
to Ext. 1, Ext. 2, Ext. 3, Ext. 4 and Ext. 6 along with the plaint and the amended
written statement. According to him, before execution of the agreement (Ext. 1)
on 25.08.92 M/s Gautam Baruwa and Associates, the architect of the defendant
had prepared the drawing for the construction of the buildings. North Block of
this apartment is the suit property and there is no dispute in regard to other
properties. The parties entered into Ext. 1 written agreement keeping in view the
building plan prepared by the architect and so it is necessary to peruse the
drawing. Even in Ext. 1 it is recited at paragraph 1 that plaintiff would be entitled
to built up areas on ground floor, mezzanine floor and first floor as per the
drawing dated 12.12.90 although there was minor mistake in describing the
drawing number. The parties were aware that there may be changes in the
drawing and so made appropriate safeguard for the plaintiff at paragraph 2 of
the agreement by providing that in case of deviation from the drawing mentioned
therein the plaintiff would always be entitled to minimum built up area calculated
as per the said original drawing and the minor deviations, either less or more
than the entitlement, would be adjusted against the amount payable in cash by
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 13 of 34

the defendant to the plaintiff. The payment schedule is provided in paragraph 3
of the Ext. 1 agreement. But after possession was handed over and
measurement of the land was made it came to light that although the agreement
had been entered into for a plot of land measuring 1 B 2 K 10 L but there was
8.35 lechas less than the said area and so it was not possible to make the
construction as per the drawing prepared by Gautam Baruwa as referred in the
Ext. 1 agreement. This being position, both the parties abandoned the earlier
terms and conditions mentioned in paragraph 1 of the said agreement which
would be evident from their conduct. Ext. 2 are the original drawings basing on
which the Ext. 1 agreement was made. Pointing to Ext. 3 he argued that it is
letter dated 09.03.98 written by the defendant to the plaintiff and this letter
would show the real bone of contention between the parties. The defendant is
agreeable to allot total built up area as agreed to between the parties at the time
of execution of Ext. 1 but a difference of opinion cropped up later in regard to
concept of the built up area. According to Mr. Mishra, built up area cannot be the
area within the four walls of an apartment. An owner of an apartment cannot
make use of his apartment without any means for ingress and egress and this is
why he is bound to make use of the stair case, the lift, the lobby and other areas
which are known as common areas. These common areas are owned by all the
apartment owners jointly. While purchasing an apartment, one is bound to
purchase proportionate title to such common areas as well and this is why it is an
universally accepted proposition that built up area purchased by a purchaser
includes not only the area within the four walls known as carpet area but it also
includes proportionate share in the common areas. The parties entered into
agreement knowing this basic fact but subsequently the plaintiff started claiming
RFA 38 of 2006                                                        Page 14 of 34

that area purchased by him should be within the four walls. In Ext. 3 letter the
defendant not only made a reference to this difference of opinion in paragraph
(1) and (2) but also indicated his intention to resolve the dispute between the
parties. Accordingly, 7 days the defendant thereafter sent a letter on 16.03.98 to
the plaintiff showing the recalculation as pledged in Ext. 3 letter. The letter dated
16.03.98 is Ext. 4. In this letter, the defendant informed the plaintiff that all
common areas such as lift well, corridor, lobby, duct etc had already been
excluded as suggested by the plaintiff and thereupon the plaintiff would be
entitled to 8804.77 sq.ft. in all in three floors, namely, ground floor, mezzanine
floor and third floor. As per the agreement plaintiff is entitled to half of the built
up area of the ground floor, half of the built up area of the mezzanine floor and
the complete first floor. As per the original drawing No. GBA/891/03-A, the built
up area of the ground floor was 1824.68 sq.ft. in all. Similarly, that of mezzanine
floor was 2641.96 sq.ft. and the complete third floor was shown as 6571.45 sq.ft.
That being the position, the plaintiff was entitled to 912.34 sq.ft in the ground
floor, 1320.98 sq.ft in the mezzanine floor and 6571.45 sq.ft. in the third floor.
The total built up area already handed over to the plaintiff was 1611.875 sq.ft. in
the ground floor, 1611.875 sq.ft. in the mezzanine floor and 4406.11 sq.ft. in the
third floor and this is how plaintiff has already been given 7629.86 sq.ft. out of
the total entitlement of 8804.77 sq.ft. and so the balance 1174.91 sq.ft. are to be
handed over to him on the eighth floor. From this area 224.34 would be adjusted
against balance payment of room No. 1 and so final built up area to be handed
over to the plaintiff in the eighth floor would be 950.57 sq.ft. Pointing out to Ext.
6, he argued that the calculation given on Ext. 6 is absurd on the face of it and
that it was prepared on 24.09.98, one day after institution of the suit only for the
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 15 of 34

purpose of the litigation. In Ext. 6 built up area of ground floor has been shown
as 415.39 sq.m and this is equivalent to 4469.59 sq.ft. but in paragraph 6 of the
plaint, the plaintiff himself stated that half of the built up area of ground floor is
2669.50 which means that the total built up area of ground floor would be 5339
sq.ft. Similarly, in para (10) of the examination in chief plaintiff stated on oath
that he is entitled to receive 12172 sq.ft. built up area in total out of which 2669
sq.ft ought to have been allotted in the ground floor. Thus, while the plaintiff
himself pleaded and proved that total built up area of the ground floor was 5339
sq.ft. but in Ext. 6 this has been shown as 4469.59 sq.ft. (equivalent to 415.39
sq.m). He further argued showing Ext. 6 total built up area has been shown by
PW 2 at the mezzanine floor to be 374.26 sq.m and this is equivalent to 4027.03
sq.ft. The half of this would be 2234.795 sq.ft. But in paragraph 6 of the plaint
and in paragraph 10 of the examination in chief the plaintiff had stated that half
of the mezzanine floor was 2372.50 sq.ft. Coming to the calculation of built up
area in the first floor as per Ext. 6, the PW 2 has claimed the same to be 984.86
sq.m which is equivalent to 10597.09 sq.ft whereas in paragraph 6 of the plaint
as well as in paragraph 10 of the examination in chief, the plaintiff himself
showed that the total built up area in the first floor was only 7135.92 sq.ft.
Moreover, if the built up area as shown in Ext. 6 is considered, the plaintiff would
be entitled to the following built up area in total:-
        Ground floor =        2234.79 sq.ft.
        Mezzanine floor = 2013.51 sq.ft.
        First floor =       10597.09 sq.ft.
        __________________________
        Total built area = 14,845.39 sq.ft.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                           Page 16 of 34

            But both in the pleading and in his deposition plaintiff claimed that he
is entitled to 12,172 sq.ft. and so the Ext. 6 is beyond pleading and is also
absurd. This exhibit, therefore, does neither help the plaintiff nor does it disclose
the facts.
[19]        Mr. Mishra by pointing out to the Ext. 2 drawings as prepared by PW 2
argued that drawing of the mezzanine floor exhibited by the plaintiff himself
shows that total floor area in the North Block is 440.97 sq.m. This, if converted
into square feet would be 4745 sq.ft and half thereof, would be 2372.50 sq.ft.
The same area has been shown by plaintiff in paragraph 6 of his plaint so there
is no dispute that total built up area of the mezzanine floor irrespective of
whether it is described as floor area or not, it is 4745 sq.ft. From Ext. 2 in so far
as it relates to drawing of mezzanine floor is concerned, the total floor area is
same as that of total built up area as pleaded in paragraph 6 of the plaint. Now,
the drawing of mezzanine floor itself contains common areas like staircase, lift
well etc. and so it is clear that even in the drawing the total built up area
included the common areas like lift well staircase, lobby etc. The PW 2 who
prepared the drawing nowhere has made any positive statement that total floor
area of the mezzanine floor does not include the common areas. According to Mr.
Mishra, both the parties, therefore, were aware even at the time of execution of
the agreement that the total built up area included the common areas. Even the
plaintiff himself admitted in Ext. H at page 2 that he had been allotted possession
of built up area in the first floor to the extent of 1464.50 sq.ft. in addition to
common area in proportionate basis to the extent of 558.19 sq.ft. In mezzanine
floor he had been allotted ten shop units measuring 1414 sq.ft. in addition to
common area in proportionate share to the extent of 544.74 sq.ft. Similarly, in
RFA 38 of 2006                                                           Page 17 of 34

the third floor he got the complete built up area of 4205 sq.ft. in addition to
common area (lift well, lobby, staircase, duct, toilet etc.) and this is how plaintiff
had been handed over total built up area of 8736.43 sq.ft. Evidently, this
8736.43 sq.ft consists of 7083.50 sq.ft exclusively and 1652.93 sq.ft. jointly in
the common areas. These calculations have been shown from page 2 of Ext. H, a
letter written by plaintiff to the defendant on 15.09.97 and it was exhibited
through the plaintiff during his cross examination as PW 1 and the plaintiff has
not denied the content of this letter. Plaintiff has not denied to have issued the
letter. The Ext. H, according to Mr. DK Mishra, finally negates the claim of the
plaintiff that total built up area available to him as per paragraph 1 of the Ext. 1
agreement does not include common areas which is the only substratum for the
suit. If this proposition goes, the whole suit of the plaintiff crumbles down. The
learned trial court committed error in not noticing these apparent and glaring
relevant aspects but for which the impugned judgment and decree has been
vitiated. The suit, therefore, is liable to be dismissed by setting aside the
impugned judgment and decree, Mr. Mishra argued.
[20]            Mr. Mishra also argued by showing Ext. F that the defendant on
24.03.95 informed the plaintiff that as per mutual agreement entered into on
that date plaintiff would be given areas at various floors including mezzanine
floor and that he would be given total built up area of 12172 sq.ft. including
common areas and service areas. Apart from that the available furnishings were
also mentioned in the said letter. By showing this letter Mr. Mishra argued that it
establishes deviation from original agreement dated 25.08.92 and also inclusion
of common areas in the built up area. Even thereafter on 06.08.97, the plaintiff
had asked for certificate of ownership and certificate of possession from the
RFA 38 of 2006                                                           Page 18 of 34

plaintiff without expressing any grievance about the allotment and possession.
This letter dated 06.08.97 has been admitted in evidence as Ext. 5 without any
objection. Thereafter on 12.08.1997 vide Ext. G defendant had informed the
plaintiff in writing that he had already possessed the G.M.C. holding numbers for
the areas allotted to him on the first, mezzanine and third floors and that
agreement for the eighth floor had been drawn up for his signature during the
next visit to Guwahati for which an advance copy was also sent to him. In that
letter the built up area already handed over to the plaintiff was shown as to 2630
sq.ft. in the first floor, 3066 sq.ft. in the mezzanine floor and 5330 sq.ft in the
third floor in December, 1996 itself. Thus, plaintiff had already got 11,026 sq.ft.
from the defendant and he was entitled to balance 1,146 sq.ft which would be
given in the eighth floor. It is only thereafter the Ext. H letter dated 15.09.97 was
issued by the plaintiff to the defendant admitting that he had been given
proportionate share in the common areas to the extent of 1652.93 sq.ft. in all
(558.19 sq.ft. in the first floor + 544.79 sq.ft. in the mezzanine floor + 540 sq.ft.
in third floor = 1652.93 sq.ft in all).
[21]         Coming to the plea as to money claim made by the plaintiff, Mr. DK
Mishra has pointed out that on his own showing, the plaintiff had received Rs.
4,00,000/- from the defendant during the period from August, 1992 to
December, 1994. He by that letter allowed adjustment of Rs. 1,00,000/- towards
beautification of the commercial building. He also himself valued the less amount
of land handed over by him after physical verification at Rs. 4,00,000/-. This is
because plaintiff was supposed to hand over 1 B 2K 10 L of land to the
defendant but on physical verification it was found that he had handed over only
1 B 2 K 1.65 L and thus there was a deficit of 8.35 L for which there was a
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 19 of 34

corresponding diminution in the total value of the land. The land was originally
valued at Rs. 63,00,000/- as shown in Ext. H and the plaintiff himself calculated
the price of 8.35 L to be Rs. 4,00,000/- in his letter dated 15.09.97 (Ext. H) at
paragraph (4). So, plaintiff had already received Rs. 9,00,000/- in all although he
was supposed to have received Rs. 7,00,000/- as claimed in paragraph 18 of the
plaint. The plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled to Rs. 3,00,000/- as claimed by him
in paragraph 18 of the plaint and his claim of money is demolished by his own
letter Ext. H. The impugned judgment and decree for the money component,
therefore, is vitiated for non-consideration of this valid piece of evidence.
[22]        Appearing for the sole respondent, Mr. RC Sancheti, learned counsel
argued on the other hand that the learned trial court has not committed any
error in passing the impugned judgment and decree. The defendant appellant
undertook by entering into Ext. 1 agreement to hand over 12,172 sq.ft. of built
up area to the plaintiff respondent and it is specifically mentioned in the
paragraph 2 of this agreement that even if there is any deviation from the
drawing prepared by M/s Gautam Baruwa & Associates, the plaintiff shall
continue to remain entitled to 12,172 sq.ft. of built up area. Because of certain
circumstances, the first drawing prepared by M/s Gautam Baruwa & Associates
had to be abandoned but this does not mean that the agreement as a whole has
ceased to exist. Even the defendant has not denied its liability to hand over
12,172 sq.ft. of built up area to the plaintiff but the defendant has taken a new
stand by saying that the built up area would also include the common areas. This
was never the intention of the parties at the time of entering into the agreement
and this is also evidenced by defendants letter dated 09.03.1998. The defendant
had specifically disclosed in this letter that they would agree to the plaintiff’s
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 20 of 34

definition of built up area which means that built up area means the area within
the four walls excluding the common areas such as lift well, lobby, corridor etc.
But by taking a different stand in Ext. 4 letter defendant in fact included the
common area in the definition of the built up area and so such revocation of the
agreement would be impermissible. The defendant actually handed over 7548.45
sq.ft. of built up area and so is liable to hand over balance 4623.55 sq.ft. to the
plaintiff. The learned trial court having considered the relevant documents have
come to finding that the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance of Clause 1(i)
to 1(iii) of the agreement along with decree for recovery of money and as such
there is no merit in the appeal which, accordingly, is liable to be dismissed.
[23]            Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of
the respective pleadings as well as the evidence on record vis-à-vis the findings
of the learned trial court, the following points for determination are found to
arise in the present appeal:-
             i) Whether the parties had entered into agreement knowing that ‘built
         up area’ as mentioned in Ext. 1 agreement includes the common area?
            ii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance as claimed?
            iii) Whether plaintiff is entitled to a money decree as prayed for?
Point No.1
Whether the parties had entered into agreement knowing that ‘built up
area’ as mentioned in Ext. 1 agreement includes the common area?
[24]           Although it is apparent from the pleadings and evidence led by the
parties that the bone of contention between them is about the concept of built
up area but no issue was framed by the learned trial court on this point.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 21 of 34

However, parties have led evidence to establish their respective view as to
whether built up area includes common area or not. The learned trial court did
not make any discussion as to what was meant by the parties as to ‘built up area’
when they had entered into Ext. 1 agreement. The learned trial court by avoiding
this discussion has impliedly accepted the definition given by the plaintiff and the
possible reason for so doing appears to be recital of Ext. 3 letter dated
09.03.1998 whereby the defendant appears to have accepted the definition of
the plaintiff. It is, therefore, necessary to decide as to whether the defendant
had really abandoned its own definition of ‘built up area’ and accepted the
proposition of the plaintiff that ‘built up area’ excludes common areas like lift
well, lobby, staircase etc. While Mr. Sancheti strenuously urged that in last
paragraph of the Ext. 3 letter the defendant had expressly accepted the plaintiff’s
definition, Mr. Mishra argued to the contrary. To understand this question, the
Ext. 3 is carefully perused. The relevant part of the letter dated 09.03.1998 (Ext.
3) is quoted below for ready reference:-
               “(1) That the “built up area” as in clause 1(i), (ii) & (iii) of the
         Agreement between yourself and the Company (Deed No. 5581 dt.
         25.08.92) should be defined as “the area within the four walls excluding
         the common areas such as lift well, lobby, corridor etc.”
               (2) That our method of calculation and the area so calculated is not
         acceptable to you.
               Since we wished to resolve this long outstanding issue as early     as
         possible, we agree to your definition of “built up area’’ and shall
         recalculate the area to be allotted to you and shall inform you shortly”.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 22 of 34

[25]            Ext. 3 letter dated 09.03.1998 indicates that the parties were at
variance in regard to definition of ‘built up area’ and thereupon the defendant
accepted the case of the plaintiff and assured to recalculate the area to be
allotted to the plaintiff. The defendant also assured that the outcome of the
recalculation would be intimated to the plaintiff shortly. The next communication
by the defendant in this regard is the letter dated 16.03.1998 i.e. a letter sent by
the defendant 7 days after the issuance of the letter dated 09.03.1998 (Ext. 3).
The letter dated 16.03.1998 has been produced and exhibited by the plaintiff as
Ext. 4. In this letter the defendant stated in page 1 under paragraph A and B that
the plaintiff was entitled to 912.34 sq.ft. of ‘built up area’ being half of ground
floor, 1320.98 sq.ft. being half of mezzanine floor and 6571.45 sq.ft. being total
of the first floor and thus plaintiff was entitled to 8804.77 sq.ft. out of which he
was already handed over 1611.875 sq.ft. at the ground floor, 1611.875 sq.ft. in
the mezzanine floor and 4406.11 sq.ft. in the third floor and so plaintiff had
already got 7629.86 sq.ft. This was disclosed in paragraph C of the letter.
Thereafter further entitlement of the plaintiff was shown to be 1174.91 sq.ft. in
paragraph D by deducting 7629.86 sq.ft. from 8804.77sq.ft. From this ‘built up
area’ again 224.34 sq.ft. was adjusted against Room No. 201 and finally, plaintiff
was said to be entitled to 950.57 sq.ft. in the eighth floor. Plaintiff is aggrieved
by this letter on the ground that it is not in conformity with the previous letter
dated 09.03.1998. According to Mr. DK Mishra, the defendant did not accept the
contention of the plaintiff that ‘built up area’ does not include common area as
without common area no one can make use of his apartment. Unless there is
means for ingress and egress, there is no question of purchasing a flat. The
whole apartment complex is owned by the flat owners. They own the common
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 23 of 34

areas jointly and the carpet area exclusively. It is the consistent stand of the
appellant that parties had accepted this ground reality and the plaintiff was no
exception. Mr. Mishra has drawn attention of the court to Ext. H to show that
even the plaintiff admitted to have got common area in proportionate share
basis. I have perused Ext. H carefully. It is a letter dated 15.09.1997 written by
the plaintiff to the defendant. This letter is important not only for the purpose of
understanding the stand of the parties as to definition of ‘built up area’ but also
for understanding the dispute between the parties on the money component. For
the time being let us confine to the aspect relating to ‘built up area’ only. In this
letter, after giving the calculation as to money component of the deal, the
plaintiff narrated that he had been allotted possession of the ‘built up area’ as
mentioned therein. The relevant part of this letter is quoted below for ready
reference:-
          “Till date I have been allotted possession of built up area in the following
manner.
     1.(a) Complete built up area i/e peripherial walls in the Ist Floor comprising of 10
shop units……………………………………………………………………:-                                   1464.50 Sq.Ft.
        (b) Common area in proportionate share basis……………… :-              558.19 ,, ,,
     2.(a) Complete built up area i/c peripherial walls in the Mezzanine Floor comprising
of 10 shop units………………………………………… :-                                      1414.00 ,, ,,
        (b) Common area in proportionate share basis……………… :-              544.74 ,, ,,
     (3) a. Complete built up area i/c peripherial
walls in the 3rd Floor………………………………………………….. :-                            4205.00 ,, ,,
          b. Common area (lift well, lobby,staircase,duct,toilets etc.)…:- 540.00 ,, ,,
                                                                    _______________
                                                            Total:-       8726.43 Sq.Ft.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                                  Page 24 of 34

         Therefore the balance area (12172 Sq.Ft. – 8726.43 Sq.Ft.) 3445.57
Sq.Ft. will be accommodated to me in the top floor. And the cost of the
remaining portion in that floor will be paid to you before start of construction in
the said floor.”
[26]          If Ext. 3 and Ext. 4 are studied and compared it would appear that
prima facie, defendant undertook to accept the definition of ‘built up area’ given
by the plaintiff and thereafter deferred the matter for recalculation of the
entitlement on the light of such definition. But in the subsequent communication,
the defendant made recalculation as to entitlement of the plaintiff by applying his
own definition of the ‘built up area’ and thus included common areas in the ‘built
up area’. This letter was written on 16.03.1998. But prior to that it is the plaintiff
who had accepted the concept of ‘built up area’ as given by the defendant in his
letter dated 15.09.1997 and made his own calculation about the entitlement of
‘built up area’. According to the version of the plaintiff in the said letter dated
15.09.1997 (Ext. H), he was allotted possession of 8726.43 sq.ft of ‘built up area’
in total in three floors, namely, first floor, mezzanine floor and the third floor. Out
of this total ‘built up area’ of 8726.43 sq.ft. plaintiff himself admitted in the said
letter that there was 558.19 sq.ft. common area in the first floor, 544.74 sq.ft.
common areas in the mezzanine floor and 540 sq.ft. in the third floor. Thus, out
of 8726.43 sq.ft. ‘built up area’ handed over to the plaintiff, there was 558.19
sq.ft. + 554.74 sq.ft. + 540 sq.ft. = 1652.93 sq.ft. common areas and balance
7083.50 sq.ft. under exclusive possession of the plaintiff. The plaintiff after
showing this calculation claimed thereafter that he was still entitled to 3445.57
sq.ft. in the top floor i.e. eighth floor. The sum of 8726.43 sq.ft. + 3445.57 sq.ft.
is 12172 sq.ft. and so there is logic behind this calculation shown by the plaintiff.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                           Page 25 of 34

Once this calculation is accepted, it is to clear that prior to issuance of letter
09.03.1998, the plaintiff had accepted the proportion that built up area would
include common areas. If plaintiff had accepted the proposition of the defendant
in regard to concept of ‘built up area’ he cannot resile subsequently in view of
bar under section 5 of the Indian Contract, 1872.
[27]           However, as a matter of abundant caution it is necessary to verify
from a different angle as to whether parties had understood common areas as a
part of ‘built up area’ at the time of execution of the agreement and atleast prior
to cropping up of the dispute between them. It is clear from above that drawings
prepared by M/s Gautam Baruwa & Associates which are exhibited as Ext. 2
(series) and the same are the basis for execution of Ext. 1 agreement. It is only
after physical verification of the land it came to light that the land under
agreement was 8.35 L less than 1 B 2K 10 L and so the Ext. 2 maps became
useless but for which Ext. A, B, C maps had to be prepared by engaging a
different set of architects. Parties were aware even at the time of execution of
Ext. 1 agreement that there is likelihood of deviation from the Ext. 2 drawings
prepared by M/s Gautam Baruwa & Associates and this is why to safeguard the
plaintiff who is the land owner appropriate provision has been made in paragraph
2 of the Ext. 1 agreement itself. Thereby it has been made clear that even if
there is deviation from the drawing, plaintiff will continue to remain entitled to
12,172 sq.ft. of ‘built up area’. To understand as to what was the idea of the
parties about ‘built up area’ at that time is not expressed in the Ext. 1 agreement
but there are clues in Ext. 2 drawings basing on which the Ext. 1 agreement was
signed. The drawing of the mezzanine floor in Ext. 2 contains a key to find
answer to this question. The drawing shows total floor area of the mezzanine
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 26 of 34

floor in the North Block as 440.97 sq.m. This calculation is given in the C.G.S.
system and its equivalent in the F.P.S. system can be found by multiplying this
figure by 10.76391. This means that 440.97 sq.m. is equal to 440.97 x 10.76391
= 4745 sq.ft. This is the total area in the mezzanine floor in the North Block.
Since, under the agreement plaintiff is entitled to half of this floor he is entitled
to get 2372.50 sq.ft being half of 4745 sq.ft. In paragraph 6 of the plaint and
paragraph 10 of his examination-in-chief, the plaintiff has claimed exactly the
same amount of the ‘built up area’ in the mezzanine floor. So, there is no dispute
between the parties that mezzanine floor under the drawings of M/s Gautam
Baruwa & Associates as exhibited vide Ext. 2 measured 4745 sq.ft. only. Now, if
this drawing is perused it would appear that apart from the rooms, there are lift
well, staircase, lobby etc. in this floor as well. This being the position, 4745 sq.ft.
being the total ‘built up area’ of this floor definitely included the common areas
like lift well, lobby, staircase etc. as well. That means, the parties were aware at
the time execution of the agreement that ‘built up area’ within the meaning of
Ext. 2 drawings included common areas.
[28]          Lastly, the concept of vertical village as initiated in post partition State
of Maharastra which by now has been inculcated by the rest part of the country
leading to legislation by the respective Governments is based on concept of
community life where joint ownership of the ingress and egress and common
facilities have been recognized. The concept of vertical village became a
necessity in view of paucity of urban land associated with population explosion.
One cannot afford to have an independent house with exclusive passage, lobby,
staircase and all but he has the necessity for the same. This is why under the flat
ownership system, the purchasers have to go for joint ownership of some
RFA 38 of 2006                                                              Page 27 of 34

facilities which are known as common facilities as well as common areas. Joint
ownership of common areas has to be purchased because it involves construction
cost and this is why a flat owner apart from purchasing his exclusive carpet area
is required to purchase proportionate title to the common areas and is duty
bound to contribute for its time to time maintenance and repairing. This has
become a matter of general recognition that ‘built up area’ purchased by a flat
owner includes proportionate share in the common areas as well. The first point
for determination is accordingly decided in favour of the appellant and against
the respondent plaintiff.
Point No.2
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance as claimed?
[29]          The parties had entered into agreement dated 25.8.1992 vide Ext.1.
The plaintiff being the owner in possession of the land handed over the same to
the defendant on the consideration that he would be paid some amount in cash
and he would be given some built up area. The consideration for transferring the
ownership of land, therefore, was of two categories. Coming to the component of
finished built up area, the parties relied on Ext.2 drawings and based on
calculation of floor areas as made in the said drawings. The plaintiff was entitled
to get his share in 3 floors of the building. He was entitled to get half of each of
the ground floor and the mezzanine floor and the complete built up area of the
first floor. This was the original contract between the parties. However, a scope
for modification was left in the body of the agreement itself at paragraph 2. It is
RFA 38 of 2006                                                         Page 28 of 34

provided in this paragraph that in case of deviation from the drawings, the total
entitlement of the plaintiff would remain the same.
[30]          After there was physical verification of the land and the same was
measured, the parties realized that there was 8.35 lechas of less land than what
was mentioned in the agreement. So, the Ext.2 drawings became useless
necessitating the parties to go for a set of fresh drawings. Upto this stage there
is no dispute between the parties. The fact that land handed over by the plaintiff
to the defendant was not 1 B 2K 10 L and that there was a deficit of 8.35 L is not
disputed by the plaintiff. Consequently, it is also not disputed that because of
such difference in the area of land defendant had to go for a fresh set of
drawings. Under such circumstances, there was need for recalculation of the
entitlement of the plaintiff. But in doing so it was not open to the defendant to
diminish the ‘built up area’. The entitlement of the ‘built up area’ of the plaintiff
by all means is saved by paragraph 2 of the agreement. This is how by
considering the floor areas of the building under the Ext. 2 drawings, parties
arrived at the consensus that the plaintiff was entitled to 12,172 sq.ft. ‘built up
area’ in all. Applying the formula of deviation prescribed under paragraph 2 of
the agreement, it is to be seen whether under Ext. A, B and C drawings on the
basis of which the North Block has been constructed, plaintiff has got 12,172
sq.ft. of ‘built up area’. In view of the findings recorded under point No. 1 above,
this ‘built up area’ would contain the common areas as well. Both the sides agree
that plaintiff has not yet received 12,172 sq.ft. of ‘built up area’. While according
to the plaintiff vide paragraph 12 of the plaint he has got only 7324.11 sq.ft., he
is entitled to 4623.55 sq.ft. more, the defendant does not agree to the same.
According to him, plaintiff has already been handed over 7548.45 sq.ft.
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 29 of 34

Forgetting this difference for the time being it is to be seen whether the plaintiff
is entitled to the specific performance as prayed for.
[31]         According to the averment and prayer made in the plaint, plaintiff is
entitled to specific performance of clause 1(i) to 1(iii) of the Ext. 1 agreement
dated 25.08.1992. Clause 1(i) to 1(iii) have been discussed above. By these
clauses plaintiff became entitled to half of the ‘built up area’ of the ground floor,
half of the ‘built up area’ of the mezzanine floor and complete ‘built up area’ of
the first floor. The agreement between the parties in regard to plaintiff’s
accommodation in various floors referred to above, there is no saving clause in
paragraph 2 like saving clause for the total floor areas. The part of the
agreement as to total entitlement of ‘built up area’, therefore, is immutable and
not subject to change and so, plaintiff is entitled to specific performance as to
quantum of total ‘built up area’ subject to provisions of clause 2 of the Ext. 1
agreement. First, there is no saving clause for choice of floors in case there is
deviation from the drawing. The defendant, therefore, cannot be compelled to
accommodate the plaintiff in the floors mentioned in Ext. 1 agreement in case
there is deviation from the drawing. There is deviation from the drawing and
admittedly defendant is not responsible for the same as the plaintiff himself was
not aware about existence of actual area of the land under the agreement. No
building has been constructed as per agreement Ext. 1 and drawings Ext. 2.
Consequently, the accommodation of 12,172 sq.ft. have to be made as per the
drawing in Ext. A, B and C. Under section 12 of the Specific Relief Act, if a part of
the contract is unable of being performed, in that event a party may be entitled
to obtain decree for specific performance of that part of the contract only which
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 30 of 34

is capable of being performed and shall be entitled for compensation for the
remaining part.
[32]               Moreover, in view of variation of the drawings resulting from
discovery that there was less land in existence, parties appear to have modified
their contract for which the plaintiff accepted ‘built up area’ in first floor,
mezzanine floor and the third floor instead of ground floor, mezzanine floor and
the first floor. From Ext. H the letter dated 15.09.1997 written by plaintiff shows
that he had been allotted possession of ‘built up areas’ in the first floor,
mezzanine floor and the third floor. Even in Ext. G, the letter dated 12.08.1997
written by the defendant to the plaintiff, the defendant claimed to have handed
over 11,026 sq.ft. of ‘built up area’ to the plaintiff in December, 1996 and so, the
plaintiff, according to the defendant, was entitled to 1,146 sq.ft. at the eighth
floor. Thus, in correspondence by both sides it is apparent that the plaintiff did
not object to accepting accommodation at first, mezzanine and the third floor of
the building instead of ground, mezzanine and first floor as enumerated in the
agreement. The learned trial court has not considered these aspects of the
matter. The learned trial court has passed decree for specific performance of
clause 1(i) to 1(iii) of the agreement on 26.09.2005 when the construction of the
building has been completed and the plaintiff had already been accommodated in
first, mezzanine and third floor of the said building. What would happen to those
‘built up areas’ which have already been handed over to the plaintiff 19 years ago
which he is either enjoying or has transferred a part of it to various parties and
so those parts cannot be returned by the plaintiff to the defendant even if he is
given accommodation in the floors as mentioned in the agreement? The decree
passed by the learned trial court, therefore, is vitiated for non-consideration of
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 31 of 34

the aforesaid aspects of the matter. The learned trial court has not noticed that
by accepting accommodation in December, 1996, the suit was instituted only in
the year 1998 and so, plaintiff became estopped from reviving his claim under
clause 1(i) to 1(iii) insofar as the same relates to choice of floors. Apart from that
it has been stated at the bar that both the parties agreed before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court during pendency of SLP that plaintiff would get the balance floor
area in the eighth floor. Considering the entirety of circumstances including event
of impossibility to accommodate under Ext. 2 drawings, acceptance of ‘built up
area’ in other floors in deviation from clause 1(i) to 1(iii) of the Ext. 1 agreement
and the agreement of the parties for providing ‘built up area’ at the eighth floor
which is evidenced in the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court copy of which has
been provided by learned senior counsel, Mr. DK Mishra, the plaintiff is not
entitled to accommodation in ground, mezzanine and first floor as mentioned in
clause 1(i) to 1(iii) of the agreement but he is entitled to specific performance for
getting balance ‘built up area’ in the eighth floor. What shall be the quantum of
such entitlement, however, is different question and the same cannot be
deduced from the evidence available on record more particularly, when both the
parties do not agree on fact as to what is the total ‘built up area’ already handed
over to the plaintiff and he has been enjoying the same for nearly two decades
last. To get the answer to this question, a further evidence is necessary. The
second point is accordingly decided partly in favour of the plaintiff and partly
against him as indicated above.
Point No. 3
Whether plaintiff is entitled to a money decree as prayed for?
RFA 38 of 2006                                                            Page 32 of 34

[33]          The learned trial court noticed that the land under agreement was
valued at Rs. 63,00,000/- out of which Rs. 4,00,000/- was deducted being value
of the less land measuring 8.35 L. But even thereafter decreed that plaintiff is
entitled to Rs. 3,00,000/- being the balance sum payable to him by the
defendant. In so doing, the learned trial court has not considered Ext. H letter
dated 15.09.1997 written by the plaintiff to the defendant. In this letter plaintiff
admitted to have received Rs. 4,00,000/- from the plaintiff during the period
from August, 1992 to December, 1994. He also admitted that a sum of Rs.
1,00,000/- payable by him towards beautification of the building was liable to be
adjusted against the cash entitlement and that Rs. 4,00,000/- was also liable to
be deducted from the total entitlement. Thus, on his own showing, the plaintiff is
no longer entitled to Rs. 7,00,000/- being his total cash entitlement as
consideration. The price of the land itself being diminished by Rs. 4,00,000/- due
to less land, the entitlement comes down to Rs. 3,00,000/- out of which Rs.
4,00,000/- had been received in cash and Rs. 1,00,000/- was payable by the
plaintiff towards beautification of the building. But since the defendant did not
file any counter claim or did not claim set off, although plaintiff appears to have
received more than his entitlement, the defendant would not be entitled to
recovery. The result is that, plaintiff is not entitled to any more money from the
defendant and accordingly, this point is decided against the plaintiff and in favour
of the defendant. The decree for Rs. 3,00,000/- along with interest passed by the
learned trial court, therefore, is hereby set aside.
[34]             Summing up, the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance of
contract for getting balance of the 12,172 sq.ft. being his entitlement under the
agreement dated 25.08.1992 but not entitled to specific performance of clause
RFA 38 of 2006                                                          Page 33 of 34

1(i) to 1(iii) thereof except total ‘built up area’. Since there is no sufficient
material available on record to arrive at a finding as to what is the total ‘built up
area’ already handed over to the plaintiff, this Court is not in a position to pass a
decree for specific performance and the matter has to be remanded to the
learned trial court by setting aside the impugned judgment and decree to decide
the following issue:-
               What is the total built up area already handed over to the plaintiff
        and how much more ‘built up area’ is to be handed over to the plaintiff in
        the eighth floor of the building?
[35]        The learned trial court shall decide the aforesaid issue after affording
adequate opportunities to the parties to lead further evidence and shall also
appoint Commission for the purpose. Since the suit is of the year 1998, the same
may be done as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of 6 months
from today. Parties shall appear before the learned trial court on 30.09.2015 for
receiving necessary orders. The Registry shall send down the records
immediately.
[36]         The appeal stands allowed. The impugned judgment and decree is
hereby set aside subject to observations made hereinabove.
[37]         No order as to costs.
                                                                     JUDGE
