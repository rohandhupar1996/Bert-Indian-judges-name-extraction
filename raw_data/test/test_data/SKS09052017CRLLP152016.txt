                           THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Date of Hearing and Judgment: 09.05.2017
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. K. Sahoo, J.            The petitioner Biswajit Dash was the complainant in
         a case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
         1881 (hereinafter ‘N.I. Act’). The complaint petition was filed
         before the learned J.M.F.C., Tigiria vide 1.C.C. No.105 of 2009
         against the opposite party Trilochan Behera who faced trial in the
         said Court and was found guilty under section 138 of the N.I. Act

                                2
and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of
one year and was also directed to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-
(rupees five lakhs only) to the petitioner as compensation under
section 357(3) of Cr.P.C., in default of payment of compensation,
to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months.
            The opposite party preferred an appeal in the Court
of Session which was heard by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge,
Athagarh in Criminal Appeal No.07 of 2015 and the learned
Appellate Court vide impugned judgment and order dated
14.12.2015 allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and
order of conviction passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Tigiria. The
ground of acquittal is that after the intimation regarding
dishonour of cheque was received from the bank by the
complainant on 26.06.2009, the advocate’s notice sent by the
complainant through registered post returned back to the sender
on 07.07.2009 with last endorsement of the postman till dated
03.07.2009 and thereafter the complaint petition was filed on
09.07.2009 and the cognizance of offence was taken on the very
day of filing of the complaint petition. It was held that the
procedure   laid  down   under    section  138  of  the N.I.  Act
enumerates that fifteen days time to be given to the accused for
repayment of the cheque amount and if the accused fails to pay
the cheque amount within the said period then the complainant

                                 3
has remedy to take shelter in the Court of law after lapse of
fifteen days from the date of receipt of the notice by the
accused. It was further held that it is a mandate of statute
provided in the Act and filing of complaint violating the statutory
provision amounts to no complaint in the eye of law.
             In case of Yogendra Pratap Singh -Vrs.- Savitri
Pandey & Another reported in (2014) 59 Orissa Criminal
Reports     (SC)    577,   where    the   question   came   up    for
consideration as to whether cognizance of offence punishable
under section 138 of the N.I. Act can be taken on the basis of a
complaint filed before the expiry of the period of fifteen days
stipulated in the notice required to be served upon the drawer of
the cheque in terms of section 138(c) of the Act, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court answered it in the negative. It was further held
that the complaint under section 138 of the N.I. Act filed before
the expiry of fifteen days of service of notice could not be treated
as a complaint in the eye of law and criminal proceedings
initiated on such complaint are liable to be quashed. After taking
note of the decision in the case of Yogendra Pratap Singh
(supra), I have held in the case of Ranjan Kumar Senapati -
Vrs.- State of Orissa reported in (2017) 66 Orissa Criminal
Reports 539 that an opportunity has been given by the
legislature itself by the providing a notice to the drawer and for

                                 4
payment of the amount within fifteen days of the receipt of the
said notice and if he fails to comply with clause (c) of section 138
of the N.I. Act, filing of a complaint within one month from the
date of cause of action is also provided under sub-section (b) of
section 142 of the N.I. Act. It was further held that the drawer of
the cheque has got an opportunity to know in advance before
filing the complaint that the cheque was dishonoured for a
particular reason upon receipt of the notice from the payee or
the holder of the cheque and thereby making payment of the
cheque amount to the payee so as to prevent initiation of any
complaint case proceeding against him. The penal provisions
have to be construed strictly and not liberally. A pre-mature
complaint cannot be the foundation of a valid prosecution.
            In view of the ratio laid down in the cases of
Yogendra Pratap Singh (supra) as well as Ranjan Kumar
Senapati (supra), I find that there is no illegality or infirmity in
the impugned judgment and order of the learned Appellate Court
in allowing the appeal and setting aside the order of conviction
passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Tigiria in 1.C.C. No.105 of 2009
against the opposite party. Therefore, in absence any illegality or
infirmity in the judgment of the Appellate Court, I am not
inclined to grant leave to the petitioner to prefer an appeal
against the order of acquittal.

                                    5
                 Accordingly, the CRLLP petition stands dismissed.
                 Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in
view of the ratio laid down in the case of Yogendra Pratap
Singh (supra), the complainant may be permitted to present the
complaint petition again notwithstanding the fact that the period
of one month as stipulated under section 142(1)(b) of the N.I.
Act for the filing of such a complaint has expired. He relied upon
paragraphs 41 and 42 of the said judgment. The petitioner is at
liberty to present the complaint petition again before the
competent Court, in the event of which, the same shall be
considered in accordance with law.
                                                      …………………………
                                                       S.K. Sahoo, J.
