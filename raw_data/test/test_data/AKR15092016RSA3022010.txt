                                   JUDGMENT
     PRESENT:
                 THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
               Date of Hearing & Date of Judgment: 15.09.2016
DR.A.K.RATH, J.    This is an appeal from a judgment and decree dated
     26.6.2010 and 6.7.2010 respectively passed by the learned Ad hoc
     Additional District Judge (FTC), Kamakhyanagar in R.F.A.No.48 of
     2008/02 of 2009 confirming the judgment and decree dated
     25.9.2008 and 20.10.2008 respectively passed by the learned Civil
     Judge (Sr.Division), Kamakhyanagar in Civil Suit No.41 of 2005.
     2.          The    appellant   as   plaintiff  instituted the   suit for
     declaration of right, title and interest over the suit land, permanent

                                       2
injunction and in the alternative, for recovery of possession,
impleading the respondents as defendants. The case of the plaintiff is
that he is in possession of the suit schedule land along with other
lands. The said land was recorded in his name in the final R.O.R.
published in the year 1983. He is cultivating the said land since the
time of his father and regularly paying rent to the Government. In the
current settlement operation, mother of defendant no.1, namely,
Saugi Nath, managed to gain over the Settlement Amin and made an
entry of forcible possession in the R.O.R. against suit plot no.246.
Taking advantage of the wrong entry in the R.O.R., defendant no.1
tried to re-plough the suit land on 10.7.2005, but due to protest, he
could not enter into the suit land. The further case of the plaintiff is
that in the year 1976, he had alienated sabik plot no.154/186,
measuring an area of Ac.0.12 decimals along with some other plots
i.e., plot no.154/188, measuring an area of Ac.0.13 decimals
appertaining to sabik khata no.33 to one Rama Chandra Pattnaik
and defendant nos.5 to 7 by means of a registered sale deed. No
consideration was paid by defendant nos.5 to 7 and Ram Chandra
Pattnaik. The said transaction was only a paper transaction. The
plaintiff is still in possession of the suit land.
3.             Pursuant to issuance of summons, defendant no.1
entered appearance and filed a comprehensive written statement and
counter claim denying the assertions made in the plaint. The case of
the defendants is that the land recorded under suit khata no.35
originally belonged to one Murari Nath. The land was recorded in his
name during sabik settlement. Murari Nath had two daughters,
namely, Suagi-mother of defendant no.1 and Asha-mother of the
plaintiff. Murari Nath had no male issue. During his childhood, the

                                   3
plaintiff had lost his parents and became an orphan. He was brought
up under the care and custody of Suagi Nath. Suagi Nath and her
husband performed the marriage of the plaintiff. After marriage, the
plaintiff stayed separately. During the life time, Murari Nath divided
his landed properties recorded in khata no.33 of mouza-Mundideuli
and had given Ac.2.23 decimals of land to Suagi Nath and Ac.1.24
decimals of land to the plaintiff. Thereafter Mutation Case No.282
was initiated. By order dated 23.5.1941, the land was mutated in
favour of the respective parties. As the plaintiff was minor, the entire
property of Murari Nath was under joint cultivating possession of
Suagi Nath in spite of separate mutation. After marriage of the
plaintiff in the year 1950, he started living separately from Suagi
Nath and possessed the land mutated in his name, except sabik plot
no.154/186, measuring an area Ac.0.12 decimals. Suagi Nath
continued to remain in possession of the said plot to the knowledge of
the plaintiff on her own right, exclusively without any obstruction or
hindrance either from the plaintiff or from anybody and, as such she
acquired right, title and interest by way of adverse possession in
respect of the said plot no.154/186, which corresponds to hal plot
no.246. The plaintiff has no semblance of right, title, interest and
possession over the suit land. After the death of Suagi Nath, the
defendants continued to possess the suit plot no.246. The sabik plot
no.156 corresponding to hal suit plot no.250 belongs to the plaintiff
and he is in possession of the said land. The defendant no.1 filed a
counter claim with the prayer to declare his right, title and interest
over the suit land and to declare the recording of the suit land in
favour of the plaintiff as erroneous, confirmation of possession as
well as permanent injunction.

                                      4
4.            The plaintiff filed written statement to the counter claim
denying the claim of defendant no.1. It is stated that the suit land
was divided by Murari Nath in the year 1941. But then, the lands
were in possession of Suagi Nath as well the plaintiff.       He denied
being brought up by Suagi Nath and the possession of Suagi Nath as
well as defendant no.1 over suit plot no.246.
5.            On the inter se pleadings of the parties, the learned trial
court struck seven issues. To substantiate the case, the plaintiff had
examined three witnesses and on his behalf, eight documents had
been exhibited. Defendant no.1 had examined four witnesses and on
his behalf, seven documents had been exhibited. The learned trial
court came to hold that the plaintiff has got right, title and interest
over the suit plot no.250 under khata no.35. It was further held that
defendant no.1 has successfully established that he has perfected the
title over plot no.246 by way of adverse possession. Assailing the said
judgment and decree, the plaintiff filed an appeal, being R.F.A.No.48
of 2008/R.F.A.No.02 of 2009, before the learned Ad hoc Additional
District Judge (Fast Track), Kamakhyanagar, which was eventually
dismissed.
6.            Heard Mr.Ramakanta Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate
for the appellant.
7.            Mr.Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant,
argues with vehemence that findings of the courts below are perverse.
Criticizing the judgment of the courts below, he submits that there
was no material on record before the courts below to arrive at a
finding that defendant no.1 has perfected title over plot no.246.

                                     5
8.             The submission of Mr.Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate,
is difficult to fathom.
9.              On a threadbare analysis of the evidence on record, both
oral and documentary and on an anatomy of the pleadings, the
learned trial court came to hold that the mother of defendant no.1
was in possession over plot no.246 in the year 1983-84. In the
settlement proceedings, the plaintiff himself has admitted that the
mother of defendant no.1 was in position since 1950. After her death,
defendant no.1 is in possession. Defendant no.1 has successfully
established that he had perfected title by way of adverse possession
over plot no.246 under khata no.35. The lower appellate court
concurred with the finding of the court below. There is no perversity
or illegality in the findings of the courts below. The appeal does not
involve any substantial question of law and, accordingly, the same is
dismissed.
                                              ……..…………………..
