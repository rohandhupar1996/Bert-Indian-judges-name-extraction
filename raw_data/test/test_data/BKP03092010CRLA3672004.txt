      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.K.PATEL, J.        This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated
      23.11.2004       passed      by    the     learned     Special     Judge      (Vigilance),
      Bhubaneswar in T.R. Case No. 36 of 1991 convicting the appellant under
      Section 161 of the I.P.C. and Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(d) of the
      Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (for short ‘the P.C.Act’)                          and
      sentencing him to undergo R.I. for six months and to pay                           fine of
      Rs.1000/-, in default to undergo R.I. for one month, on each count.
      2.             The appellant was working as Medical Officer of Adaspur
      Primary Health Centre during the period of occurrence. On 21.4.1987

                                      2
P.W.1 the informant-decoy had admitted his wife in the Health Centre and
in the same night she delivered a child.
             The prosecution case is that the appellant demanded bribe of
Rs.200/- to relieve P.W.1’s wife from the hospital. As P.W. 1 expressed
inability to pay Rs.200/-, the appellant finally agreed to accept Rs.100/-
from him. P.W. 1 paid Rs.70/- and promised to pay Rs.30/- later on at
the time of discharge. P.W. 1 lodged written report Ext.1 on 23.4.1987
before Superintendent of Police (Vigilance), Cuttack Division, Cuttack
stating therein that he was required to pay the balance bribe amount to
the appellant on the following day. P.W. 8 Inspector, Vigilance Cell
Cuttack was directed to take up investigation. In course of investigation,
P.W. 8 laid a trap stated to have been prepared with the assistance and in
presence of P.W. 4 Executive Magistrate, P.W. 5 another Inspector of
Vigilance Cell, Cuttack and P.W. 6 a Senior Assistant working in the
Cuttack Collectorate. The appellant was caught red handed after
accepting the tainted currency notes from P.W. 1 towards illegal
gratification as a motive for treatment and discharge of P.W.1’s wife. The
tainted notes recovered from the appellant were seized. Hand wash of the
appellant sent for chemical examination to the State Forensic Laboratory
was examined by P.W. 3 Scientific Officer. On 29.8.1987 P.W. 8 made
over charge of investigation to P.W. 9. On completion of investigation P.W.
9 submitted charge-sheet for commission of offences under which the
appellant stands convicted and accordingly charge was framed.

                                      3
3.          The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge. He took the
stand that cash of Rs.30/- recovered from him was received by him
towards repayment of loan availed by P.W. 1.
4.          In order to substantiate the charge, prosecution examined
nine witnesses and, also relied upon documents marked Exts. 1 to 15 and
material exhibits M.Os. I to VII. P.Ws. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 have already
been introduced. P.W. 2 was working as a staff nurse in Adaspur Primary
Health Centre and P.W. 7 was examined to prove sanction for
prosecution. No defence evidence was adduced.
5.          It is evident from the defence plea that the appellant does not
dispute recovery of tainted money from his possession. However, it was
contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that there is no
evidence on record to show that the appellant ever made any demand for
money from P.W. 1 as motive for treatment and discharge of his wife.
Appellant’s plea to have accepted Rs.30/- from P.W. 1 towards refund of
loan amount finds support from the evidence of P.W. 2. Evidence of P.W.
6, stated to have accompanied P.W. 1 to overhear the conversation
between the decoy and the appellant, also does not support the allegation
that the appellant accepted the amount as bribe. The learned court below
has arrived at the findings on the basis of surmises and conjectures. . In
support of his contentions learned counsel for the appellant relied upon
the decision of this Court in Arakhita Nath vs. The State of Orissa :
(2009) 42 OCR 34.

                                     4
             In reply, it was argued by the learned counsel for the
Vigilance Department that P.W. 1 having substantially supported the
allegations made against the appellant in course of his examination-in-
chief, the learned court below rightly discarded his assertion made in
course of cross-examination to the effect that he paid Rs.30/- to the
appellant towards refund of loan amount.
6.           Specific case of the prosecution is that the appellant
demanded bribe of Rs.200/- from P.W.1 in connection with his wife’s
treatment in the Primary Health Centre.      P.W.1 having expressed his
inability to pay Rs.200/- the appellant agreed to accept Rs.100/-. P.W.1
paid Rs.70/- and promised to pay balance amount of Rs.30/- at the time
of discharge. At the time of discharge appellant demanded and accepted
Rs.30/- in the shape of the tainted currency notes.
7.           Informant P.W.1 did not support the prosecution case during
trial and, therefore, he was permitted to be cross-examined by the
prosecution. P.W.1 vaguely alleged in the examination-in-chief that the
appellant demanded Rs.200/- concerning expenses for delivery. He was
altogether silent regarding demand of Rs.100/- and part payment of
Rs.70/-. In course of cross-examination by prosecution P.W.1 disowned
the allegations made in the F.I.R. in that connection.    He denied that
P.W.6 was deputed by the investigating officer to overhear conversation
between him and the appellant.         In course of cross-examination by
defence, P.W.1 squarely supported the defence plea. He deposed that he
purchased medicine by taking Rs.30/- from the appellant as he had no

                                      5
money to pay for the cost of medicine amounting to Rs.26/-. P.W.2 was
present    when he     took money    from  the appellant. He categorically
testified that money which was detected in course of trap was the money
which he had returned to the appellant and that the appellant never
demanded any money for his wife’s delivery till date of her discharge.
P.W.2 the staff nurse deposed in her cross-examination that the appellant
had given a prescription to P.W1 to purchase medicines.      As P.W.1 had
no money he requested the appellant for money on loan basis. As per the
request the appellant brought Rs.30/- from his house and gave to P.W.1.
P.W.6,    who was deputed by the Investigating Officer to overhear the
conversation between the appellant and P.W.1, simply deposed to have
seen P.W.1 handing over money to the appellant after discharging P.W.1’s
wife.
8.           Thus, positive evidence adduced by the prosecution in court
does not support the allegation of demand of Rs.100/- made by the
appellant from P.W.1.     Evidence of P.W.1 is prevaricating.  Evidence of
P.W.2 supports the defence plea that loan of Rs.30/- was advanced by the
appellant to P.W.1. No other witness including P.W.6 deposed regarding
demand of bribe made by the appellant. As has been observed by this
Court in Arakhita Nath vs. The State of Orissa(supra) mere recovery of
money divorced from the circumstances under which it was paid is not
sufficient to convict the accused when substantive evidence in the case is
not reliable. In absence of proof of demand, there is no basis to sustain

                                      6
the conviction of the petitioner either under section 161 of the I.P.C. or
under section 5(2) read with section 5(1)(d) of the P.C.Act.
9.            In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment
and order are set aside.
