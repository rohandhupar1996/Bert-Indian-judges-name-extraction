Date of Hearing :: 20.11.2015 :: Date of Judgment 03.12.2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               This appeal has been filed against the judgment and
decree passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Jaleswar in
R.F.A. No.23 of 2011. The predecessor-in-interest of the present
appellants as the plaintiff had filed the suit for declaration of right,
title and interest over the suit land with further prayer for
declaration that the preparation of the record of right in the major
settlement is wrong and erroneous. Ultimately, the suit having

                                   // 2 //
been dismissed, an appeal had been carried and that has also
been dismissed. So, the present appeal has been filed under
section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
2.            For the sake of convenience, in order to bring in
clarity and avoid confusion, the parties hereinafter have been
referred to as they have been arraigned in the trial court.
3.            Plaintiffs case is that the suit land was Anabadi land
of the then Zamindar of the area, namely, Gokul Prasad Jena and
others. One Gobinda Chand of village-Budhakusumi was granted
lease of the suit land for the purpose of cultivation in the year
1942 and it was evidenced by one unregistered amlanama patta.
During abolition of the zamindari estate, the then Zamindar had
submitted a Rafa in the name of the said Gobinda and basing on
that the tenant ledger was opened and rent was realized by the
State. It is also the case of the plaintiff that while Gobinda was the
owner of the suit land, he and his son sold land measuring
Ac.0.49.5 dec. out of Ac.1.04 dec. on the southern side recorded
under C.S. plot No.332 and Ac.0.5 dec. under C.S. plot No.337 to
one Rama Chandra Marandi and delivered possession of the same
to him on the same day. They also sold the other pertain of that
C.S. Plot No.332 to one Phulray Murmu followed by delivery of
possession. Both the purchasers when were in possession of the

                                 // 3 //
said land sold those to the plaintiff by two registered sale deeds
dated 21.06.1968 having obtained necessary permission from the
competent authority under the O.L.R. Act in O.L.R. Case Nos.608
and 610 of 1968 as the vendors belonged to the members of the
scheduled tribe. Thus, the plaintiffs claim to be the absolute owner
of the said land measuring Ac.1.09 dec., which has later on
reduced by Ac.0.05 dec. It is stated that the land being reduced by
Ac.0.05 dec. rest Ac.0.04 dec. has been wrongly recorded in the
name of the State under Rakhit Khata No.186 with Kisam as
Jungle and Gochara. However, it is pleaded that the said land
actually is of kisam Sarada-III and has been in cultivable
possession of the plaintiff. This wrong recording having been
noted, the plaintiff after serving notice under section 80 of the
Code of Civil Procedure filed the suit after having waited for the
required period and as no response came from the side of the
State.
4.           The defendant in the written statement contested the
claim of the plaintiff. The factum of grant of lease is denied, as also
the opening of the tenant ledger and collection of rent. The sales
as averred by the plaintiffs said have been made first in favour of
Rama Chandra and Phulray and then in his favour are also

                                   // 4 //
challenged. It is asserted that the recording in the settlement
operation is right.
             The trial court on such rival pleadings framed six
issues and has rightly taken up issue no.3 and then issue no.4 for
decision. Issue no.3 is as to whether Gobinda was the tenant
under the then Zamindar and later on under the State whereas
issue no.4 concerns with the sale of the land by Govinda to Rama
Chandra and Phulray and thereafter in favour of the plaintiff by
those Rama Chandra and Phulray which in turn thus concerns
with the right, title of the plaintiff over the land in suit.
5.           Upon analysis of evidence in the backdrop of the
pleadings, issue no.3 has been answered in favour of the plaintiff.
             It has been held that the then Zamindar had delivered
possession of the suit land to Gobinda and also that Gobinda was
a tenant under the then Zamindar and as such was in possession
of the said land all along and then he remained as a tenant under
the State being recognized as such upon opening of the tenancy
ledger and payment of rent as well as its due acceptance.
             Next in respect of issue no.4, the trial court’s
categorical finding is that the recording of the land as made in the
M.S. R.O.R. is wrong. It has been specifically found out that an
error has been committed by the settlement authority in recording

                                 // 5 //
the suit land in the name of the State under Rakhit Khata. With
these findings now going to the other technical issues as regards
the maintainability of the suit, lack of cause of action and law of
limitation standing on the way of the suit, the answer however,
has been given against the plaintiff holding the suit to be not
maintainable being hit under section 34 of the Specific Relief Act
as there remains no prayer seeking consequential relief such as
the relief of confirmation of possession. It has next been said that
the suit having not been filed within three years from the date of
publication of the record of right, the same is barred by limitation.
              So with all the finding of right, title and interest
having been rendered in favour of the plaintiff, he has been non-
suited for the aforesaid reasons.
6.            The lower appellate court being moved has again gone
to affirm all those findings of the trial court on those factual
issues. Going one step ahead, the lower appellate court has of
course set aside the finding of the trial court that the suit is not
maintainable being hit under section 34 of the Specific Relief Act
but despite of the same it has refused to grant the relief to the
plaintiff as because, according to him, the suit is not maintainable
being not instituted in adherence to the provision of Article 58 of
the Limitation Act.

                                 // 6 //
7.           The appeal has been admitted on the following
substantial question of law:
                “Whether the courts below have erred in law
          by dismissing the suit of the plaintiff on the
          ground of limitation that it has not been filed
          within a period of three years from the date of
          publication of the record of right under the Orissa
          Survey and Settlement Act or within the limitation
          under article 58 of Indian Limitation Act?’
8.           Challenging the findings of the trial court the State
has not filed any cross-objection in the appeal before the lower
appellate court nor any such step has been taken in the present
second appeal. Therefore, the findings on issue nos.3 and 4 as
recorded by the trial court and affirmed by the lower appellate
court are no more open to challenge here in this appeal. The
position is fairly and rightly conceded by the learned Additional
Government Advocate in course of hearing of this appeal.
9.           Now, coming to the substantial question of law as
framed in this appeal with which we are presently concerned, the
learned counsel for the appellant submits that the suit being one,
based on title and having been filed within a period of 12 years,
Article-58 of the Limitation Act does not get attracted on the face
of the categorical findings of the courts that the appellants are in
possession of the suit land having their right, title and interest

                                  // 7 //
over the same. It is also his submission that when a person is in
possession of the immovable property on the strength of his right,
title and interest, merely because, the erroneous record of right is
published and as such is allowed to stand for a period of more
than three years from its publication, it is not the law that the
right, title and interest of the person concerned gets extinguished
thereby and he thereby looses the right to institute the suit for
declaration of right, title and interest. It is his submission that
when the Civil Court declares the right, title and interest of a
person and finds the possession of the property with that person,
the erroneous record of right is pushed to oblivion thereby. The
person i.e. title holder in possession cannot thereby loose the right
to institute the suit for declaration of right, title and interest if he
does not file the suit within three years from said publication of
record of right which is found to be erroneous in not recognizing
the right, title, interest and possession of the person and article 58
of Limitation Act is not attracted in that event to non-suit the
person. It is his submission that when the court declares the right,
title and interest of the person and finds the possession of the
property with that person, the declaration with the record of right
is erroneous in recording the land in favour of someone is just
consequential. In view of the above, he contends that the

                                 // 8 //
substantial question of law is required to be answered accordingly
in favour of the plaintiff and the suit of the plaintiff is thus to be
decreed.
10.           Learned Additional Government Advocate, however,
submits in favour of the finding rendered by the lower appellate
court that in view of the provision contained in Article 58 of the
Limitation Act, when the suit has not been filed within the
prescribed period, it is barred by limitation.
11.           Law is fairly well settled that in a suit based on
antecedent title, when the Court finds the same in favour of the
plaintiff and also finds his possession to have been there over the
suit land, even if he does not call in question the wrong recording
of the suit land in the settlement operation within a period of three
years as prescribed in Article 58 of the Limitation Act and also as
prescribed in Section 42 of the O.S.S. Act, he cannot be shown the
door of exit and cannot be non-suited on that ground, on the face
of the settled law that the entry in the record of right does neither
create title in favour of someone who in fact does not have it nor
does extinguish the title of the true owner in respect of the said
land. So, in that view of the matter when the title holder continues
to remain in possession of the property despite of said wrong
recording, his non-filing of the suit within a period of three years

                                     // 9 //
from the date of publication of the said erroneous R.O.R. cannot
extinguish his right, title and interest over the property and as
such he does not become disentitled to continue to be in
possession as of that.
               The aforesaid discussion and reasons provide the
answer to the substantial question of law accordingly and it runs
in favour of the plaintiff-appellant.
    12.        In the result, the appeal stands allowed and in the
facts and circumstances of the case without cost. The suit filed by
the plaintiff is decreed declaring right, title and interest over the
suit property as also their possession with further consequential
declaration that the entry in the record of right in respect of the
said suit land is erroneous.
