                                              7
         PRESENT:
                  THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI
            Date of hearing: 03.04.2015 | Date of judgment :     16.04.2015
Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.      In these batch of petitions, the petitioners have
         challenged      the    notifications   dated     14.09.2009      and
         19.03.2013issued by Kendriya Vidyalaya regarding revised fees
         structure by which the pupils of the institution will have to pay the
         fees at the enhanced rate w.e.f. 01.10.2009 and 01.04.2013
         respectively in the shape of Computer Fund and Vidyalaya Vikas
         Nidhi (VVN) contribution. Earlier assailing the notification dated
         14.09.2009 issued by Kendriya Vidyalaya regarding revised fee
         structure w.e.f. 01.10.2009, a batch of writ petitions has been filed
         and this Court in Niranjan Mishra and others v. Union of India
         and others, 2013 (I) OLR 441 allowed the writ petitions and
         quashed such notification. Subsequently, in spite of quashing such
         notification, the Kendriya Vidyalaya issued another notification on
         19.03.2013 for revision of Computer Fund and VVN contribution
         w.e.f. 01.04.2013 which is the subject matter of challenge in these
         writ petitions.
         2.              The short fact of the case in hand is that the
         Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathana is a society registered under the
         Societies Registration Act, 1860. The society is question has been
         set up to open, manage and administer the Kendriya Vidyalayas
         throughout the country and abroad. As per the scheme, the

                                     8
Sangathan opens Kendriya Vidyalaya to cater to the educational
needs    of  the  children   of   Transferable  Central  Government
Employees. These Kendriya Vidyalayas are set up in the Civil and
Defence Sectors. In addition to these Vidyalayas, the Sangathan
also opens, administers and manages the Vidyalayas on the specific
request of the Government of India undertaking Companies to cater
to the educational needs of the Children of the sponsoring agencies
which are named project Kendriya Vidyalayas.
3.              The   service   of  the  employees    working  under
different departments of the Central Government is transferable
throughout the country. Different states follow their individual
teaching and education systems in the primary and secondary
levels and that too in their local languages. The employees of
Central Government when transferred from one State to another
would face serious difficulty in the matter of education of their
children due to this diversity of education from one State to
another. So with a primary view to make available a uniform
system of education the Government of India thought it proper to
establish Central Schools in different parts of the country so that a
single system of education can be availed by the children of the
Central Government Employees. For that purpose the Kendriya
Vidyalaya Sangathan was created as a Registered Society under the
Ministry of Human Resources Development to establish, manage
and impart a uniform system of education in all the Central Schools
so established. The Sangathan is managed by a Board of Governors

                                     9
under which Standing Committees are formed and a Commissioner
is appointed as the Executive Head of the Sangathan and the Chief
Administrator of Kendriya Vidyalayas. All the Kendriya Vidyalayas
are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi
and follow the uniform pattern of courses of study and examination
system throughout the country. All the policy decisions in respect of
Sangathan are taken by its Board of Governors, which is headed by
the Minister of Human Resources Development, Government of
India.
4.              The   fee  structure   applicable in  the   Kendriya
Vidyalayas is decided by the Board of Governors of the Sangathan
from time to time. Kendriya Vidyalayas are maintaining the SF
account to which all the funds received from the Government of
India and Tuition Fees are credited. In addition, the Kendriya
Vidyalayas are also maintaining Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN) and
Computer Fund. As per the provision contained in Articles 2 to 4 of
Chapter –II of the Education Code for Kendriya Vidyalaya and
Chapter-XV of the Education Code deals with the fees and funds
contained in Articles 117 to 124.
5.              The   VVN    and  Computer     Funds  are    for the
development of School and overall welfare of the student‟s
community. The scope of activities of the VVN have enlarged in a
geometrical progression day by day and the previous financial
resources were inadequate to meet these activities such as

                                   10
implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to “2009 Act”), creation of
ICT infrastructure, Sports and Medical Facilities etc.. The Finance
Committee duly constituted in its meeting held on 29.06.2009
deliberated over the revision of tuition fee, computer fund, new
children education allowance scheme, Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN)
contribution and accordingly recommended the same to the Board
of Governors for the approval.
6.              The Board of Governors in its 84th meeting held on
29.07.2009 approved the recommendations made by the Finance
Committee in its meeting held on 29.06.2009 and further the Board
decided to enhance the fees (VVN, Tuition fees and Computer Fund)
with effect from 01.10.2009. As regards the expenditure from VVN,
the specific norms duly approved by the Board of Governors have
been issued by the KVS under delegation of power under VVN and
the accounts of KVS are regularly monitored by the External Audit
of the KVS, Regional Office. Therefore, in order to augment financial
resources to meet the additional requirement of funds, a proposal
for enhancement of VVN and Computer Fund was placed before 94 th
meeting of the Board of Governors of KVS held on 28.12.2012. As
per direction, the matter was placed before the Minister, Human
Resources Development and Chairman of the KVS for his approval.
Thereupon,     considering the   justification of   enhancement    of
Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN) and Computer Fund, the Chairman,
KVS approved the proposed enhancement of fees. Accordingly, the

                                     11
impugned notification was issued on 19.03.2013 for revision of
Computer Fund and VVN contribution w.e.f 01.04.2013. Assailing
the decision taken on 01.10.2009, which has been directed to be
implemented     pursuant    to notification  dated  19.09.2009,  one
Niranjan Mishra and others approached this Court by filing a writ
petition bearing W.P.(C) No. 14739 of 2009 and after due
adjudication, this Court quashed the said notification and allowed
the writ petition vide judgment dated 19.12.2012.
7.             Though battery of counsels had appeared in these
batch of writ petitions, Mr. S.K. Ojha, Mr.Piyush Kumar Mishra,
Mr.M.K.Sahoo     and    Mr.D.Chhotray    have  addressed   the  Court
justifying their challenge to the impugned notification dated
13.3.2013, stating, inter alia, that once the notification dated
14.9.2009 has been quashed by this Court in Niranjan Mishra and
others (supra), subsequent notification would not have been
issued by the opposite parties to circumvent the effect of the said
judgment without following due procedure of law. It is further urged
that such revision of fee structure so far as Computer Fund and
Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN) contribution are concerned, that itself
is violative of the provisions contained in 2009 Act and Rules
framed thereunder and once the judgment has been rendered by
this Court quashing the notification dated 14.9.2009 regarding
revised fee structure, the subsequent notification issued by the
authority is in gross violation of the said judgment in Niranjan
Mishra and others (supra). To substantiate their contention, they

                                    12
have relied upon the judgments in Niranjan Mishra and others
(supra),    Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank and another,            AIR
2000 SC 1535, Pinaki Chatterjee and others v. Union of India
and others, (2009) 2 SCC ( L & S) 259, State of Tamil Nadu &
Ors. V. K. Shyam Sundar & Ors. AIR 2011 SC 3470, S.I. Rooplal
and Anr. V. Lt. Governor through Chief Secretary, Delhi and
Ors. Civil Appeal Nos. 5363-64 of 1997 decided on 14.12.1999.
8.             Mr. S.K. Pattnaik, learned Senior Counsel, Mr. K.B.
Panda    and   Mr.H.K.Tripathy,   learned    counsel  have   entered
appearance for the Kendriya Vidyalaya , but the main argument
was advanced by Mr.S.K. Pattnaik, learned Senior Counsel, who
urged that in view of the provisions contained in Articles 2 to 4 of
Chapter-II of the Education code of Kendriya Vidyalaya read with
Chapter XV of the Education code containing Articles 117 to 124, it
is well within the competence of Kendriya Vidyalaya to revise fee
structure and as such, revision of such fee structure neither affects
Article 21-A   of the Constitution of India nor any of the provision
contained under 2009 Act. Since the revision of the fee structure is
well within the domain of the authority, this Court may not interfere
with the same. So far as applicability of the judgment in Niranjan
Mishra and others (Supra)         on which much reliance has been
placed by the learned counsel for the petitioners, it is stated that
admittedly the said judgment has not been assailed in any forum,
but the effect of the judgment is not applicable to the present
context as it is a per in curium judgment, meaning thereby, the

                                    13
provision of Sections 2(n), 2(P) read with Section 12(1)(c) of 2009
Act has not been taken into consideration while rendering such
judgment. Therefore, even if, the judgment of this Court in
Niranjan Mishra (Supra) has not been challenged in any forum,
but the effect of the said judgment cannot be applicable to the
present context and as such, the judgment being a per in curium
one, the same cannot be taken into consideration in accordance
with law. To substantiate his contention, he has relied upon the
judgment of Division Bench of Kerala High Court at Ernakulam in
W.P.(C) No. 13900 of 2013 in Kendriya Vidyalaya Parents
Association v. Union of India and others disposed of on 09th
June, 2014, judgment of Delhi High Court in Social Jurist, a Civil
Rights Group v. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghthan & Anr. passed
in W.P.(C) No. 2993 of 2013 disposed of on 27.11.2013, Judgment
of   Gauhati   High   Court    in   Coordination    Committee    of
Parents/Guardians of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Namrup, Assam v.
The Union of India and others,            PIL No. 36 of 2009 and
judgment of Apex Court in D.A.V. College Managing Committee
Through Regional Director v. Laxminarayan Mishra and
others, Civil Appeal No. 4556 of 2014. Learned counsel appearing
for the Union of India has supported the stand of the Kendriya
Vidyalaya regarding enhancement of fee structure in consonance
with the guideline applicable to such organization.

                                      14
9.            Considering     such   contentions   raised  by  learned
counsel for the parties and after going through the records, it is to
be considered :
              (i)   Whether the Kendriya Vidyalaya is justified in
                    revising its fee structure in consonance with the
                    provisions of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Code ?
              (ii) Whether such revision of fee structure is violative
                    of Article 21-A of Constitution of India read with
                    provisions contained in the 2009 Act ?
              (iii) Whether the impugned decision for revision of fee
                    structure so far as VVN and Computer Fund is
                    concerned is in violation of the judgment passed
                    by this Court in Niranjan Mishra (Supra)?
            ISSUE NOS. (i) & (ii)
10.         In order to augment financial resources to meet the
additional requirement of funds, a proposal for enhancement of
Computer Fund and Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN) contribution was
placed before 94th meeting of the Board of Governors of KVS held
on 28.12.2012. As per direction, the matter was placed before the
Minister, Human Resources Development and Chairman of the KVS
for his approval. Considering the justification of enhancement of
Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN) and Computer Fund, the Chairman,

                                            15
       KVS approved the proposed enhancement of fees in respect of
       Computer Fund and VVN to the following effect.

                    The provisions of Articles 59, 66 and 67A of the Account
       Code stand amended and the revised fee structure and amendment
       to Articles 59, 66 and 67A of the Accounts Code be circulated
       among all the Vidyalayas for timely implementation.
       11.           The said revision of fees has been assailed on the
       ground that the same is violative of Article 21-A of the Constitution
       of India read with provisions contained in 2009 Act. It is alleged
       that the mandate of the constitution and also 2009 Act are violated
       in action of the Kendriya Vidyalaya in collecting the revised fee
       structure from the students. Therefore, the petitioners seek to
       quash such notification on the ground that the Kendriya Vidyalayas

                                     16
are not entitled to claim the amount from its students as tuition
fees, VVN and Computer Fund or any other name. But the said
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners have been
contradicted by the learned counsel appearing for the opposite
parties.
12.          The Apex Court in Unni Krishnan J.P. and Others v.
State of Andhra Pradesh and Others, AIR 1993 SC 2178 had
taken a view that the child upto the age of 14 has the fundamental
right to be effected. The Apex Court acted on Article 45 of the
Constitution. The Apex Court also took the view that there is a
fundamental right even after a child attains 14 years but it is
subject to the State showing that financial resources cannot permit
the exercise of such right. Article 21A of the Constitution is the
response of Parliament to the judicial interpretation placed on
Article 21 and it inserted Article 21A with effect from 01.04.2010,
which reads as follows:-
             “21A. Right to education:- The State shall provide
             free and compulsory education to all children of the
             age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the
             State may, by law, determine.”
   13.       The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
   Act was framed in the year 2009 to give effect to and fulfill the
   mandate of Article 21A of the Constitution. This is for the reason
   that though Article 21A declares a Right to Education, the
   content and limits of the right were to be as provided by law and
   it is accordingly the Parliament enacted the Act in the year 2009

                                            17
   Act.    But the State of Orissa has not enacted any law till date
   and therefore, the parliamentary enactment will govern the field
   being the Central Act, i.e., 2009 Act. The salient features of the
   Act are as follows:
              Section 2(n) of the 2009 Act defines 'School' as follows:
              "(n) "school" means any recognised school imparting
              elementary education and includes-
                    (i) a school established, owned or controlled by the
                    appropriate Government or a local authority;
                    (ii) an aided school receiving aid or grants to meet whole or
                    part of its       expenses from the appropriate Government
                    or the local authority;
                    (iii) a school belonging to specified category; and
                    (iv) an unaided school not receiving any kind of aid or
                    grants to meet its expenses from the appropriate
                    Government or the local authority;”
Section 2(p) relied on by the respondents reads as follows:
              “(p) "specified category", in relation to a school, means a
              school known as Kendriya Vidyalaya, Navodaya Vidyalaya, Sainik
              School or any other school having a distinct character which may
              be specified, by notification, by the appropriate Government.”
Section 3 reads as follows:
              “3. Right to child to free and compulsory education:-
              (1) Every child of the age of six to fourteen years shall have
              a right to free and compulsory education in a
              neighbourhood school till completion of elementary
              education.
              (2) For the purpose of sub-section (1), no child shall be
              liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which
              may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing the
              elementary education:
              Provided that a child suffering from disability, as defined in
              Clause (i) of Section 2 of the Persons with Disabilities
              (Equal Opportunities, Protection and Full Participation) Act,
              1996 (1 to 1996), shall have the right to pursue free and
              compulsory elementary education in accordance with the
              provisions of Chapter V of the said Act.”
Section 6 reads as follows:
              “6. Duty of appropriate Government                  and local
              authority to establish school:- For carrying out the
              provisions of this Act, the appropriate Government and the
              local authority shall establish, within such area or limits of
              neighbourhood, as may be prescribed, a school, where it is
              not so established, within a period of three years from the
              commencement of this Act.”

                                        18
Section 8 provides duties of the appropriate Government while
Section 9 provides the duties of the local authority. Chapter IV has
the main heading “Responsibilities of Schools and Teachers”. Section
12, being of crucial importance, the same is extracted as follows:
      “12. Extent of school's responsibility for free and
      compulsory education:-(1) For the purposes of this Act, a
      school,-
      (a)    specified in sub-clause (i) of Clause (n) of Section 2 shall
             provide free and compulsory elementary education to all
             children admitted therein;
      (b)    specified in sub-clause (ii) of Clause (n) of Section 2 shall
             provide free and compulsory elementary education to
             such proportion of children admitted therein as its annual
             recurring aid or grants so received bears to its annual
             recurring expenses, subject to a minimum of twenty five
             per cent;
      (c)    specified in sub-clause (iii) of Clause (n) of Section 2 shall
             admit in class I, to the extent of at least twenty-five per
             cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to
             weaker section and disadvantaged group in the
             neighbourhood and provide free and compulsory
             elementary education till its completion:
                Provided further that where a school specified in Clause
         (n) of Section 2 imparts pre-school education, the provisions
         of Clauses (a) to (c) shall apply for admission to such pre-
         school education.
              (2) The school specified in sub-clause (iv) of Clause (n) of
         Section 2 providing free and compulsory elementary
         education as specified in Clause (c) of sub-section (1) shall be
         reimbursed expenditure so incurred by it to the extent of per-
         child expenditure incurred by the State, or the actual amount
         charged from the child, whichever is less, in such manner as
         may be prescribed:
              Provided that such reimbursement shall not exceed per-
      child-expenditure incurred by a school specified in sub-clause (i)
      of Clause (n) of Section 2:
             Provided further that where such school is already under
      obligation to provide free education to a specified number of
      children on account of it having received any land, building,
      equipment or other facilities, either free of cost or at a
      concessional rate, such school shall not be entitled for
      reimbursement to the extent of such obligation.

                                        19
             (3) Every school shall provide such information as may be
       required by the appropriate Government or the local authority,
       as the case may be.”
       Section 13 of Chapter IV prohibits any School or person while
       admitting a child from collecting any capitation fee. Section
       2(b) defines "capitation fee" as follows:
              “(b) “capitation fee” means any kind of donation or
              contribution or payment other than the fee notified by the
              school;”
Section 15 provides inter alia that a child shall be admitted in a school
at the commencement of the academic year or within such extended
period as may be prescribed. It also provides that no child shall be
denied admission if such admission is sought subsequent to the
extended period. Under Section 16, no child admitted in a school shall
be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of
elementary education. Elementary education is in turn defined in
Section 2(f), which is extracted as follows:
             (f) “elementary education” means the education from first
             class to eighth class;
Section 17 prohibits physical punishment or mental harassment to a
child.   Section   18    provides   for  the  imperative   need    to  procure
recognition in respect of a school which is established after the
commencement of the Act. A school cannot function without               getting
certificate of recognition. Section 24 provides for the duties of teachers
and redressal of grievances. Section 25 provides that the appropriate
Government and the local authority shall ensure that there is a Pupil-
Teacher ratio to be maintained in each school.

                                       20
14.            Mr.S.K.Pattnaik,    learned   Sr.Counsel      for  the  Kendriya
Vidyalaya refers to the term "specific category" under Section 2(p) of
the Act 2009. The definition of the word "school" shows that it means a
recognised     school    imparting    elementary     education.     It  includes
categories (i) to (iv). As far as category (i), which is mentioned earlier
is concerned it is the school established, owned or controlled by the
appropriate Government or a local authority. The word "appropriate
Government" is defined under Section 2(a) of the Act which reads as
follows:
      “(a) “appropriate Government” means-
           (i) in relation to a school established, owned or controlled by the
           Central Government, or the administrator of the Union
             territory, having no legislature, the Central Government;
           (ii) in relation to a school, other than the school referred to in
             sub-clause (i), established within the territory of-
             (A) a State, the State Government;
             (B) a Union territory having legislature, the Government of that
             Union territory;”
15.            As the school belonged to the 'specified category', there is
no obligation to provide free education for all the students who are
admitted in the School. It has the obligation no doubt to comply with
Section 12(1)(c) which we have referred to above. That is to say, its
obligation is fulfilled if it were to provide for reservation and admits in
class I, to the extent of at least 25% of the strength of that class, the
children belonging to the weaker section and disadvantaged group in
the neighbourhood and it provides free and compulsory elementary
education. The word “child” as belonging to the age of six to fourteen
years is defined under Section 2(c) of the 2009 Act. “Child belonging to

                                     21
disadvantaged group” is defined under Section 2(d) of the Act as
follows:-
             (d) “child belonging to disadvantaged group” means a
             child belonging to the Scheduled Caste, the Scheduled Tribe,
             the socially and educationally backward class or such other
             group having disadvantage owing to social, cultural,
             economical, geographical, linguistic, gender or such other
             factor, as may be specified by the appropriate Government,
             by notification;”
Section 2(e) defines the "child belonging to weaker section" as follows:-
             “(e) “child belonging to weaker section” means a child
             belonging to such parent or guardian whose annual income is
             lower than the minimum limit specified by the appropriate
             Government, by
             notification;”
16.         The school is honouring the said statutory obligation
enshrined under 2009 Act. As far as Article 21A of the Constitution is
concerned, as this Court has already noticed, the fundamental right
which declared free education is not an absolute right. The content of
the right and the limitations of the right are to be provided by law.
Therefore, it may not be correct to say that Article 21A of the
Constitution has not been complied with.
17.          Let me now consider the question that the Kendriya
Vidyalaya is obliged to provide free and compulsory education by virtue
of Section 3 of the Act. Section 3 provides that every child at the age of
six to fourteen years will have the right to free and compulsory
education. The institution in which such right is vouchsafed is a
neighbourhood school. Therefore, this Court may consider the effect of
sub section (2) of Section 3 of the 2009 Act. It provides that for the
purpose of sub section (1), no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee

                                      22
or charges or expenses which would prevent him or her from pursuing
and completing the elementary education. The right of compulsory and
free  education   is   given   in  a   neighbourhood      school.  The    word
"neighbourhood school" is not defined in the Act. It is also not defined
in the Rules as such. As it appears that the Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Rules, 2010, which was enforced with effect from
09.04.2010, inter alia provides as follows:-
              “6. Area or limits of neighbourhood:-
              (1) The area or limits of neighbourhood within which a
              school has to be established by the appropriate Government
              or the local authority shall be,-
                   (a) in respect of children in classes from I to V, a
                   school shall be established within a walking distance
                   of one km of the neighbourhood;
                   (b) in respect of children in classes from VI to VIII,
                   a school shall be established within a walking
                   distance of three km of the neighbourhood.
              (2) Wherever required, the appropriate Government or the
              local authority shall upgrade existing schools with classes
              from I to V to include classes from VI to VIII and in respect
              of schools which start from class VI onwards, the
              appropriate Government or the local authority shall
              endeavour to add classes from I to V, wherever required.”
18.          In fact, Section 6 of the 2009 Act casts a duty on the
appropriate Government and the local authority to establish, within
such area or limits of neighbourhood, as may be prescribed, a school,
where it is not so established, within a period of three years from the
commencement of the Act.
19.          In view of the above provisions, the inevitable conclusion
would be that K.V.S does not have an obligation to provide free
education except to the extent provided in Section 12(1) (c) of the 2009
Act. Even though Section 3 appears to provide for a right to the child, it
must be noticed that as far as the obligation of the schools which falls in

                                      23
various categories as defined in Section 2(n) is concerned, it is
specifically and expressly set out in Section 12 of the Act. As far as a
school run by a State or a local authority, in respect of all the students
admitted in such schools, these students are entitled to compulsory free
education. This is in keeping the mandate under Section 3 and there is
no conflict between the said two provisions. The child has an absolute
right and the duty is cast on the State and the local body which would
anyway answer the description of 'State' in Article 12 of the Constitution
also. As far as the aided schools are concerned, Section 12(1)(b)
describes its obligations and as we have seen, it is limited to providing
free and compulsory elementary education to such proportion of
children admitted therein as its annual recurring aid or grants so
received bears to its annual recurring expenses, for a minimum of 25%.
What this means is that even if the ratio of annual recurring aid or
grants so received and its proportion to the annual recurring expenses
does not justify such free and compulsory education, it is still obliged to
provide a minimum of 25%. As far as further obligations are concerned,
it is made depending upon the fulfillment of the statutory criteria. When
it comes to institutions and schools which are covered by Section
2(n)(iii) and (iv), in the first of which category, the Kendriya Vidyalaya
in this case would fall, and unaided school under clause (iv) of Section
2(n), their obligation would appear to be covered by what is provided in
Section 12(1)(c) of the Act. It is necessary in this context to notice that
unlike the duty cast on the Government Schools and those run by the
local bodies, which is to provide free and compulsory elementary

                                   24
education to all students who are admitted or even in respect of the
duty which is cast on aided schools falling under clause (ii) of Section
2(n) which also essentially amounts to the same, but as limited
thereunder, in respect of the schools falling in the specific categories
and unaided institutions, they are charged with the specific duty of
admitting at least 25% strength of the class from among the children
belonging to the weaker sections, in the neighbourhood. Not only that
they must be provided with free and compulsory education till its
completion. Thus, the nature and content of the obligation for the three
different categories of schools which are covered by Section 12 of the
Act are different. Their responsibilities have been spelt out by the
Legislature in unambiguous terms. Therefore, this Court is of the
considered opinion that either Article 21A or Section 3 of 2009 Act
carved out an absolute right in favour of the students aged between six
and fourteen to demand education without payment of any fees as
such.
20.           The next contention is that the Kendriya Vidyalaya is a
school which is controlled by the appropriate government, namely, the
Central Government and, therefore, it would come under class (i) of
Section 2(n) of the Act. It is contended that it has a dual capacity,
namely, it would be a specified category school coming under Section
2(n) (iii) read with Section 2(n)(p) and at the same time an institution
covered by Section 2(n)(i). Therefore, it is contended that not only
should the Kendriya Vidyalaya fulfill the mandate of Section 12(1)(c)
which is to admit students as provided in the ratio to the extent of 25%

                                       25
but it is also to provide free and compulsory education in regard to the
balance 75% having regard to its position as a school controlled by the
Central Government. In this regard, again reliance is placed on clause
(1) and (2) of Section 3 of the Act besides Article 21A.
21.           Now it is to be considered as to what is the obligation
which is to be discharged by the schools run by the Government and
the local bodies. Section 8 delineates the duties of the appropriate
Government. It inter alia provides that the Government shall provide
free and compulsory elementary education to every child. Section 8(c)
of the Act reads as follows:
                 “8. Duties of appropriate Government:
                 The appropriate Government shall -
                 (a) ...............
                 (b) ...............
                 (c) ensure that the child belonging to weaker section and
                 the child belonging to the disadvantaged group are not
                 discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and
                 completing elementary education on any grounds;
22.           A similar provision is contained in Section 9(c) of the 2009
Act in regard to the duties of the local authority. This would mean that
as far as the Government and the local authority are concerned, they
are expected not to discriminate against a child belonging to a weaker
section and the child belonging to the disadvantaged section and the
child is not to be prevented from pursuing and completing elementary
education on any ground, but there is no positive mandate that it shall
admit students belonging to the weaker sections or the disadvantaged
groups. The Legislature has mandated that the schools run under the
specified category including the Kendriya Vidyalaya herein must fulfil
that mandate and it is that role which has to be discharged by the said

                                     26
schools vide the provisions contained in Section 12(1)(c) of the Act.
Schools not only provide admission to an extent of 25% of the total
strength but for them they shall also be bound to provide free and
compulsory education. In this context, it is also noteworthy that in the
definition of the word “school” though Kendriya Vidyalayas would fall
under clause (i) of Section 2(n), they have also carved out a differential
category by declaring a specific category under Section 2(n)(iii) for the
purpose namely to delineate their statutory duty vide Section 12(1)(c)
of the 2009 Act.
23.           Section 3(2) provides that no child shall be liable to pay
any kind of fee or charges which would prevent him from completing
elementary education. In the writ petition, there is no case that the fees
which are prescribed are such that it would prevent the children from
pursuing the elementary education. It is only stated that there is
violation of Section 3(2) of the 2009 Act. As far as Sections 3(1) and
3(2) are concerned, it is noticed that the right is given to the child
between the age of six to fourteen for free education in the
neighbourhood school. There is no case for the petitioner that the
Kendriya Vidyalaya is treated as a neighbourhood school and therefore,
there is no necessity to probe that aspect further. As far as the
mandate of Section 3 (2) is concerned, in respect of the Kendriya
Vidyalayas by holding that in respect of the fees to be charged by it,
even in regard to 75% of the strength or a child which is admitted not
only to first standard but directly in any other higher standard upto the
eighth standard, it cannot be such as would prevent him or her from

                                       27
pursuing and completing the elementary education. This interpretation
would harmonize the various provisions.
24.           Similar view has also been taken by the Delhi High Court
holding that the Kendriya Vidyalaya being not run by Government of
India is entitled to different fee structure. Admittedly, the Kendriya
Vidyalayas are run by the Society and as such, no fee or charge under
any head is being charged from the 25% of children admitted under
privileged quota under the 2009 Act. Therefore, the action of the
authorities is justified in revising fee structure.
25.           Similar view has also been taken by Gauhati High Court in
Coordination Committee Parents of Kendriya Vidyalaya( supra) in a PIL
and the said judgment was assailed before the apex Court in SLP(Civil)
No. 778 of 2010 which was dismissed vide order dated 15.12.2009. In
that view of the matter the jurisdiction of the Kendriya Vidyalaya to
revise the fee structure has reached its finality by dismissal of the SLP
to the extent that the Kendriya Vidyalayas have jurisdiction to enhance
the revised fees in consonance with the provisions of law.
26.           Mr. S.K. Pattnaik, learned senior counsel for the Kendriya
Vidyalaya placed reliance on D.A.V. College Managing Committee
Through      Regional      Director    (supra)    stating   that  in   similar
circumstances, there was challenge with regard to enhancement of fee
structure of the D.A.V. Managing Committee before this Court and this
Court quashed the enhancement of fees done by the management of
the    D.A.V.   Schools     vide   judgment    dated    27.6.2011    in   The
Management of DAV Public School and batch of cases v. State of

                                       28
Orissa and others, 2011(II) OLR 665 and challenging the said
judgment of this Court, the D.A.V.College Managing Committee through
its Regional Director approached the apex Court in Civil Appeal No.
4556 of 2014. In D.A.V.College Managing Committee through its
Regional Director v. Laxminarayan Mishra and others, 2014(II)
OLR (SC) 122, the apex Court allowed the appeal and stated that the
Fee Structure Committee has been constituted, which recommended for
enhancement of fees taking into consider the various aspects, which
were urged before such Committee. Therefore, the power of the
authority with regard to enhancement of the fee structure has been
affirmed by the apex Court.
 27.           In view of the aforementioned reasons, Kendriya Vidyalaya
is justified in revising its fee structures inconsonance with the provisions
of the of Kendriya Vidyalaya Code and such revision of fees is neither
violative of Article 21-A of the Constitution nor any of the provisions of
the 2009 Act. Therefore, issue nos. (i) & (ii) are answered in
affirmative.
               ISSUE NO.(iii)
28.            It is urged by the learned counsel for the petitioners that in
view of the judgment of this Court in Niranjan Mishra (Supra), the
notification issued on 14.09.2009 regarding revised fee structure w.e.f.
01.10.2009 has been quashed and the writ petition has been allowed
and to circumvent the effect of the said judgment, subsequent
notification issued on 19.03.2013 cannot be sustained. The judgment of

                                     29
Niranjan Mishra (Supra) has not been challenged by Kendriya
Vidyalayas in any higher forum as a result of which, it has reached its
finality and any notification contrary to the said judgment cannot be
sustained in the eye of law. To substantiate such contention, reliance
has been placed on Allahabad Bank (supra) and more specifically
reference has been made to para-40 of the said judgment, wherein the
apex Court has held that in view of Section 34 of the RDB Act, the said
Act overrides the Companies Act to the extent that there is nothing
inconsistent between the Acts. Where there is inconsistency between
two special laws, namely, the Finance Corporation Act, 1995 and the
Sick Industries Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, the latter
contained Section 32 which gave overriding effect to its provisions and
was held to prevail over the former. Relying upon the same, it is urged
that since 2009 Act has got overriding effect over the provisions of the
other Acts, in that view of the matter, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are
bound to provide free education to the children belonging to 6 years to
14 years. In that view of the matter no revised fees can be chargeable
at the instance of the Kendriya Vidyalaya. The question has already
been considered elaborately while considering issue nos. 1 and 2.
Therefore, at the cost of repetition, this Court does not want to reiterate
the same, rather is of the opinion that in view of the discussion made
above, the judgment so mentioned is not applicable to the present
context.
29.         Reliance has been also placed on Pinaki Chatterjee and
others (supra) wherein the apex Court has held that regularization

                                     30
could not be made contrary to statutory recruitment rules and in
violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Therefore,
any such circular issued contrary to such provision cannot be sustained
in the eye of law. Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that
the ratio of the said case is not applicable to the present context.
30.          Last, but not the least, relying upon State of Tamilnadu
and others (supra), it is urged that the judicial pronouncement of a
competent Court cannot be annulled by the legislature in exercise of its
legislative powers for any reason whatsoever and the legislature, in
order to revalidate the law, can re-frame the conditions existing prior to
the judgment on the basis of which certain statutory provisions had
been declared ultra vires and unconstitutional. Applying the said
principle to the present context, if the legislature has no power to annul
judicial pronouncement of a competent Court, then the judgment
rendered by this Court in Niranjan Mishra (Supra) cannot be annulled by
subsequent decision taken for revision of the fee structure by KVS.
Therefore, it is profitable to take into consideration the judgment
rendered by this Court in Niranjan Mishra (Supra). Admittedly, the
revised notification dated 14.09.2009 giving effect from 01.10.2009 was
under consideration by this Court regarding enhanced tuition fees and
other fees. While dealing with the said matter, this Court has only taken
into consideration the provision of 2009 Act and Article 21-A of the
Constitution of India. With due respect to the Hon‟ble Single Judge of
this Court, the provisions contained under Section 2(P) read with
Section 12(1)(c) of the 2009 Act has not been considered in the said

                                    31
judgment. Such view has been expressed by the Division Bench of
Kerala High Court and also Single Bench of Delhi High Court and also
specifically stated by the judgment of this Court as well as Karnataka
High Court have not taken into account Section 2(n), Section 2(p),
Section 12(1)(e) of the 2009-Act. While agreeing with view expressed
by Kerala High Court and Delhi High Court, this Court is of the
considered view that the judgment of the Hon‟ble Single Judge of this
Court is per incuriam.
31.          The   Latin expression “per   incuriam”  means, “through
inadvertence”.      In   Government     of    Andhra     Pradesh      v.
B.SatyanarayanRao, (2000) 4 SCC 262, the apex Court held that the
rule of „per incuriam‟ can be applied where a Court omits to consider a
binding precedent of the same Court or the superior Court rendered on
the same issue or where a Court omits to consider any statute while
deciding that issue. Similar view has also been taken in Babu Parsu
Kaikadi v. Babu, (2004) 1 SCC 681 (para-15) and Vijay Narayan
Thatte v. State of Maharashtra, (2009) 9 SCC 92 (para-27).
32.          Similarly, in V.Kishan Rao v. Nikhil Super Speciality
Hospital and another, (2010) 5 SCC 513, the apex Court has held
that when a judgment is rendered by ignoring the provisions of a
statute and earlier larger Bench decision on the point, such decision is
per incuriam.
33.          In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Narmada Bachao
Andolan, (2011) 7 SCC 639 (680), para 67, it is held that „per

                                     32
incuriam‟ are those decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of
some statutory provision or authority binding on the Court concerned,
or statement of law caused by inadvertence or conclusion that has been
arrived at without application of mind or proceeded without any reason
so that in such a case some part of the decision or some step in the
reasoning on which it is based, is found, on that account to be
demonstrably wrong.
34.           In   M.P.   Rural   Road     Development     Authority    v.
L.G.Chaudhary Engineers & Contractors, (2012) 3 SCC 495, the
apex Court has held that the decision rendered in ignorance of previous
decision of coordinate Bench and/or the relevant statutory provisions is
per incuriam.
27.           Applying this provision to the present context, it appears
that Niranjan Mishra‟s case (supra) has not taken into consideration the
provisions of Section 2(n), 2(p) and Section 12(1)(c) of the 2009 Act.
Therefore, the said judgment is per incuriam. Even if such judgment
has not been challenged in any higher forum that has no effect for
adjudication of the matter. Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion
that it is in agreement with the decision rendered by Kerala High Court,
Delhi High Court and also Assam High Court, which has been confirmed
by the apex Court. Issue no.3 is answered accordingly.
35.           In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, this Court
is of the considered view that no illegality or irregularity has been
committed by the authorities by issuing the impugned notification      by

                                    33
revising the fee structure, which is well within their domain in
conformity with the provisions of law. Such revision of fee structure is
not violative of Article 21-A read with any of the provisions contained in
2009 Act. Accordingly, the writ petitions merit no consideration and the
same are dismissed.
