                       THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M.M. DAS
                                            AND

M. M. DAS, J.                The    petitioners       are    the  Governing       Body     of
      Gangadhar Mohapatra Law College, Puri and the Secretary of the said
      Governing Body. The aforesaid Law College is aggrieved by the action of
      the University Grants Commission (for short, ‘the UGC’) opposite party
      No.1, in not releasing the balance sanctioned amount under the 11th
      Plan, i.e., for the period from 2007 to 2012.

                                         2
2.                  The petitioner-college was established on 13.09.1981
by the educational agency, which was registered under the Societies
Registration Act, 1860. The Governing Body of the petitioner-college is
being constituted as per the provisions of the Orissa Education Act.
The college imparts undergraduate courses for LL.B. Course (Three
years LL.B. Stream). It does not receive any grant-in-aid from the State
of Odisha. The said LL.B. course is affiliated to the Utkal University, for
which the petitioner-college has obtained permanent affiliation from
the said University.
3.                  It is an admitted case that the UGC has accorded
the petitioner-college with the status under Sections 2 (f) and 12 (B) of
the UGC Act, 1956 and a certification of fitness was also granted by
the UGC to the petitioner-college to that effect. The UGC admits to
have released grants under the 8th, 9th and 10th Plan to the petitioner-
college, which has been utilized by the petitioner-college for the
purpose, for which the said grants were made.
4.                  The dispute in the present writ application is with
regard to release of allocated amount under the 11th Plan to the
petitioner-college. It appears that the parties are not in dispute with
regard to the fact that on considering the proposal of the petitioner-
college for construction of Moot-Court hall, development of sports
infrastructure,   improvement     of   teaching   aids,  procurement     of
additional   equipments,     provide   remedial    coaching  classes    for
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe and other backward class
students, coaching for entry into the service relating to the field of law
and opening of career counselling cell etc. under the merged schemes,

                                       3
the UGC accepted such proposal and approved for release of
Rs.1,61,00,000/- during the said plan period. Admittedly, out of the
aforesaid approved amount, an amount of Rs.60,82,320/- has been
received by the petitioner-college. But while the projects were
undertaken by the petitioner-college and were in the midst of
implementation, abruptly, the UGC withheld the balance amount and
did not provide the said amount to the petitioner-college with effect
from October, 2011. The petitioner has further submitted that an
amount of Rs.78,68,700/- was also approved as an additional grant to
the petitioner-college, out of which only a sum of Rs.38,94,850/- has
been received by it and the balance amount has not yet been released
by the UGC. From the annexures to the writ application, it is evident
that the petitioner-college brought to the notice of the UGC that the
grant has been abruptly stopped, as a result whereof, the petitioner-
college is unable to complete the work, for which the grants were
approved. A representation was also made bringing it to the notice of
the UGC that the 11th Plan will come to an end by 31st March, 2012.
However, it is ascertained from the learned counsel for the UGC that
though the 11th Plan period is already over, but the grants, which were
not released during the 11th Plan period, are being released in phases
to various colleges in the country as the 12th Plan has not commenced.
The petitioner-college is aggrieved by such action of the UGC in not
releasing the balance amount, which were approved for different
purposes under the 11th Plan. Under Annexure – 8 to the writ
application, the Joint Secretary of the UGC, Eastern Regional Office
wrote to the Director, College Development Council, Utkal University to

                                          4
inform the UGC regarding the status of the petitioner-college. It was
further mentioned in the said letter that in the meanwhile, the
petitioner-college may submit a proposal under the scheme for
additional grant (equipment, teaching and learning aids) to the colleges
already covered under Section 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956. It was
mentioned in the said letter as under :-
                    “However, if it is an unaided, self-
         financing college, the college will not be eligible for
         assistance under this Scheme”
It further appears from Annexure – 12, which was obtained by the
petitioner-college under the R.T.I. Act that by letter dated 09.07.2010,
the Deputy Secretary of the UGC, New Delhi intimated all the Regional
Offices that in continuation of the said office letter dated 14.06.2010
on the subject of recognition of the colleges under Section 2 (f) and
12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956 and funding of such unaided/self-financing
colleges, a decision was taken by the UGC that for the present, the
UGC will not be considering for         giving grant to the unaided/self-
financing colleges, even if they are included under Section 12(B) of the
Act.
5.                 The letter dated 14.06.2010, which was obtained
under the R.T.I. Act, has also been annexed to the writ application as
Annexure-11, which reads as follows:-
                   “UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
                   BAHADURSHAH ZAFAR MARG
                            NEW DELHI.
              No.    32/2005(CPP-1/C)               14 June 2010
            To
                   The Registrar,
                   All State Universities (List attached).

                                  5
Sub:       Recognition of colleges under section 2(f) &
           12B of UGC Act, 1956.
Sir,
      I am directed to say that the Commission at its
meeting held on 4th May, 2010 (Item No. 2.01) considered
the issue of providing 12B status to unaided, self-
financing colleges under section 12(B) of UGC Act, 1956
and resolved as under:
         The Commission noted that self-financing
colleges with 12(B) status were receiving all kinds of
grants from UGC till the IX Plan and that grants were
discontinued to such colleges in the X Plan due to
paucity of funds. It was also noted that self-financing
colleges were also being given 12(B) status earlier.
         The Commission deliberated upon various related
issues and decided as under:
1.       Government colleges, included under 12(B),
         shall continue to receive grants from UGC.
2.       All private colleges included under 12(B) and
         receiving salary grant from the State
         Government shall continue to receive grants
         from UGC.
3.       Partly self-financing private colleges i.e.
         colleges which may not be receiving grants for
         salary purpose from the Government but are
         receiving some kind of grant for any other
         purpose from the State Government or from
         any Central Government sources, may be
         awarded 12(B) status if they fulfill the
         eligibility criteria and may be considered for
         financial assistance from UGC subject to
         availability of funds.
4.       Private colleges, which are fully self-financing,
         may be awarded 12(B) status if they fulfill the
         eligibility criteria, so that they become eligible
         to receive Central Government grants from
         other sources, even if they do not receive
         grants from UGC due to paucity of funds.
        This may also be brought to the notice of all
the affiliated colleges of your University.
                                       Yours faithfully,
                                       Sd/-V.K.Jaiswal
                                       Deputy Secretary”

                                            6
6.                    Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
classification of the petitioner-college as self-financing college is
contrary to the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. For the above
purpose, reference is made to Sections- 2 (f) and 12 (B) of the Act as
well as Rule – 2 of the (UGC Fitness of Institutions for Grant) Rules,
1975. Sections 2(f) and 12B of the Act are extracted hereunder :-
             “2(f) “University” means a University established or
             incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial
             Act or a State Act, and includes any such institution
             as may, in consultation with the University
             concerned be recognized by the Commission in
             accordance with the regulations made in this behalf
             under this Act”.
              “12B. “No grant shall be given by the Central
             Government, the Commission, or any other
             organization, receiving any funds from the Central
             Government, to a University which is established
             after the commencement of the University Grants
             Commission (Amendment) Act, 1972 unless the
             Commission has, after satisfying itself as to such
             matters as may be prescribed, declared such
             University to be fit for receiving such grant”.
Rule - 2 of the Rules, 1975 reads as follows:-
             “2 – Fitness for grant:-
                   No institution to which these rules apply shall
             be declared to be fit to receive grants from the
             Central Government, the Commission or any other
             Organization receiving any fund from the Central
             Government unless the Commission is satisfied that
             the institution:
                      (i) Provides instruction up to Bachelors
                          degree or up to a post graduate decree
                          only or provides instructions for a
                          diploma course of duration of not less
                          than one academic year and for which
                          the     minimum      qualification   for
                          admission is a Bachelors degree;
                   (ii) is registered as a society under the
                          Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of
                          1860) or is a body corporate established
                          or incorporated under a Central Act, a
                          provincial Act or a State Act, for the
                          time being in force or is a Trust with

                                            7
                        Trustees being appointed and vested
                        with legal powers and duties; and
                 (iii)  is permanently affiliated to a University
                        which has been declared fit under
                        section l12B of the University grants
                        Commission Act, 1956 (3 of 1956) for
                        receiving g rants”.
A bare reading of the aforesaid provision of the Act and the Rules
framed thereunder clearly shows that there is no concept of a self-
financing institution either under the Act or under the Rules.
7.                   In view of the above resolution, as quoted above, as
per the letter dated 14.06.2010, it is found that there is no scope for
the UGC to       make a discrimination between the unaided private
colleges on the ground that such colleges are self-financing private
colleges. The concept of a self-financing private college is not envisaged
either under the Act or Rules framed thereunder.               Moreover, on
verifying the purpose of registration of the educational agency under
the Societies Registration Act, the same also does not disclose that the
petitioner-college can be termed as a self-financing private college.
8.                   It is needless to mention here that the legal
education in the State is not being given any importance, which is
required to be given to such education and as a consequence, the
teachers teaching in private law colleges in the State, are serving in
such colleges on receiving meager amount as salary. Such colleges are
not in a position to engage expert faculties, who can give much better
legal education to the students of such colleges. At this juncture, it
would be profitable to quote the speech delivered by Hon’ble Justice
A.S. Anand on 31.1.1998 on the invitation of Sarin Memorial Legal Aid

                                           8
Foundation at Chandigarh. The Hon’ble Judge, as he then was, stated
in his speech as follows:-
            “The Past.
                        The concept of legal education in India goes
             back to the Vedic age when it was essentially based on
             the concept of Dharma. There is, however, no record of
             any formal legal education being provided at that time.
             Training was self-acquired in matters connected with
             Dharma. The Kings either used to dispense justice
             themselves or appoint Judges and Assessors to
             administer justice, not necessarily trained in law but
             who were known for their righteousness and justness
             and had the reputation of being fair and impartial.
                          The pattern of legal education which is in
             vogue in India today was transplanted by the Britishers
             after the establishment of English Rule in the country. It
             was in the year 1857, that a step was taken in the
             direction of imparting formal legal education in the
             country. Three universities, set up in the cities of
             Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, formally introduced legal
             education as a subject for teaching. This was in a way
             the beginning of the era of legal education in India. At
             the initial stages, students were free to undertake
             instructions in other disciplines such as history,
             geography, science etc. along with law studies. Legal
             education was introduced in its very rudimentary form
             with hardly any standards and qualifications prescribed
             for admission to the law classes. A beginning had,
             however, been made.
                         Before India attained independence in 1947,
             there were only a few schools in the country which
             taught law. With the independence of the country, legal
             education acquired importance, as rule of law became a
             fundamental doctrine for the governance of the country.
             Since we adopted a democratic form of Government it
             became necessary that judicial system of the country
             should be brought in tune with social, economic and
             political needs of the society. With the changing complex
             of law and social needs, there was felt a greater need for
             change and reform in the structure and pattern of legal
             education. The ethos of legal education was required to
             undergo a change to fit in with the constitutional
             philosophy of ushering in the socio-economic
             transformation of the society. Gradually legal education
             was introduced as a course of study in a number of
             States.
              The Present

                              9
             Taking note of an urgent need to bring about
reforms in the university education generally,
Parliament, in exercise of its legislative power under
Entry 66 of List I enacted the University Grants
Commission Act, 1956. The University Grants
Commission Act, 1956 is an Act to make provisions for
the coordination and determination of standards in
universities. The UGC is also the authority dealing with
the grant of affiliation to the law colleges. The UGC Act
provides that it shall be the general duty of the
Commission to take, in consultation with the
universities or other bodies concerned, all such steps as
it may think fit for the promotion and coordination of
university education and for the determination and
maintenance of standards of teaching, examination and
research in the universities. Section 12(d) provides that
the UGC may recommend to any university necessary
measures for improvement of university education and
advise the university regarding the action to be taken for
the purpose of implementing its recommendations.
             The UGC Act did bring about some
improvement in the matter of regulation of standards of
teaching in the universities generally but much was still
left to be done. The decline in standards of legal
education and with that the decline in the prestige and
image of the legal profession became a cause of concern.
Dr Radhakrishnan lamented that “our colleges of law do
not hold a place of high esteem either at home or
abroad, nor has law become an area of profound
scholarship and enlightened research….”
             The Law Commission presided over by Shri
M.C. Setalvad in its report (14th Report) on “Reform of
Judicial Administration”, in 1958 while assessing the
standards of legal education obtaining in the country
said:
             “In the period of about ten years
       which has elapsed since the publication of
       the Radhakrishnan Commission, the
       position in regard to legal education in this
       country     has,    it appears,     definitely
       deteriorated.”
              The Law Commission portrayed a rather
dismal picture and lamented:
               “The portals of our law-teaching
       institutions – manned by part-time
       teachers – open even wider and are
       accessible to any graduate of mediocre
       ability and indifferent merits.

                                         10
                    hardly a pretence at teaching … This
                   character is followed by law examinations
                   held by the universities many of which are
                   mere tests of memory and poor ones at
                   that, which the students manage to pass
                   by cramming short summaries published
                   by enterprising publishers. The result,
                   plethora of LL.B. half-baked lawyers, who
                   do not know even the elements of law and
                   who are let loose upon society as drones
                   and parasites in different parts of the
                   country.”
9.              Keeping in view the above opinion of the learned Judge
expressed as early as in the year 1998, if a field study is made, it
would be seen that there is no substantial improvement in legal
education in the country. The UGC has a direct control over the Law
Colleges in our State and it provides funds in different Plans drawn out
by it for improvement and making provision of infrastructures in Law
Colleges. It has a bounden duty under law as a statutory Commission
to provide such grants for improvement of infrastructure      for College
Library, Hostel etc. and for providing equipments to aid improvement
of legal education by adopting all modern technologies.
10.          The UGC, on stopping to disburse the development grant
to such colleges will add fuel to fire, as it is already found that the
grant under the 11th Plan was approved by the UGC to be given to the
petitioner-college and the UGC could not have stopped release of such
grant abruptly after releasing some amount of the said grant, which
were approved by it earlier. The only ground, on which it appears that
the UGC has stopped release of such grant is due to paucity of funds,
which cannot be accepted to be a valid ground for stopping of release
of such grant to the petitioner-college.

11.                In the result, therefore, we are of the view that it is
necessary to issue a writ of mandamus to the UGC directing it to
release the balance amount of the 11th Plan grant as well as special
grants    under the said Plan, which was already approved by it on the
proposal submitted by the petitioner-college.
12.                We, therefore, allow the writ application by quashing
the letters under Annexures – 8 and 12 as well as the decision of the
UGC taken on 04.05.2010, which is mentioned in Clauses – 3 and 4 of
the letter dated 14.06.2010 as quoted above and direct the UGC to
release the balance amount of the approved allocation including the
special grant to the petitioner-college within a period of three months
from the date of communication of this order to the opposite parties 1
and 2.
13.                With the aforesaid observation and direction, the
writ application stands disposed of.
                     Requisites for communication of this order shall be
filed within a week.
