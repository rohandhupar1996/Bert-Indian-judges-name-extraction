Writ Petition (C) No.595/2009                                                  Page 1 of 7

2.       The joint disciplinary proceeding was started against the Head Constable
Joginder Singh and Constable Nipun Rajbongshi (petitioner) through the Charge Memo
dated 18.12.2006 (Annexure-C), issued by the Commandant of the 75th Battalion of the
CRPF and two articles of charges were leveled against each delinquent. Since the
comparison of charges will have to be made, they are extracted herein below for ready
reference:-
                                               “ARTICLE-I
         No.740280082 HC/GD Joginder Singh of Hqr/75 Bn while posted and functioning as
         Head Constable/ General Duty at T/C Vairangate in the month of April’2006 committed
         a serious misconduct in his capacity as a member of the Force under Section 11(1) of the
         CRPF Act, 1949, in that, while he was performing the duties I/C, T/C, CRPF,
         Vairangate, Mizoram on 19/04/2006, a firing incident took place at around 2000 hrs, but
         he did not report the matter to his superior authorities or the Civil Police immediately
         and informed the Unit only on 20/4/2006 at about 0700 hrs through wireless network.
         Thus, the said No.740280082 HC/GD Joginder Singh failed to maintain absolute
         devotion to duty and acted in a manner unbecoming of a member of the Force and
         thereby violated the provisions contained in Section 11(1) of the CRPF Act, 1949.
                                                ARTICLE-II
         That during the aforesaid period and while functioning in the aforesaid office/place,
         No.740280082 HC/GD Joginder Singh of Hqr/75 Bn was guilty of disobedience/grave
         misconduct in his capacity as a member of the Force under Section 11(1) of the CRPF
         Act, 1949, in that, while he was performing the duties of Section Commander of the
         Section deployed at T/C Vairangate, Mizoram on 19/04/2006, he as the supervisory
         authority did not ensure that all laid down instructions on the matters of handling of
         weapons are followed scrupulously by the men under his command. Thus the said
         No.740280082 HC/GD Joginder Singh committed an act of grave misconduct,
         dereliction of duty and acted in a manner unbecoming of a member of the Force and
         thereby violated the provisions contained in Section 11(1) of the CRPF Act, 1949.
                                               ARTICLE-III
         No.:031443875 CT/GD Nipun Rajbongshi while functioning as a Constable (General
         Duty) in 75 BN, CRPF, in the month of April, 2006 committed an act of gross misconduct
         in his capacity as a member of the Force under Section 11(1) of the CRPF Act, 1949. In
         that he despite being a trained soldier, on 19/04/2006 while performing the duties of
         sentry duty at T/C, CRPF, Vairangate, Mizoram, fired 05 rounds from 5.56 mm Insas
         Rifle Butt No.412, Body No.17479191 issued to him as his service weapon for performing
         duty, without any valid reason. Thus, he is found unskilled to handle his service weapon
         which makes him unsafe for retention in service.
                                               ARTICLE-IV
         No.:031443875 CT/GD Nipun Rajbongshi while functioning as Constable (General
         Duty) and posted in 75 BN CRPF, and assigned the duties of Sentry in Transit Camp
         Vairangate, Mizoram, committed an act of grave misconduct in his capacity as a member
         of the Force under Section 11(1) of the CRPF Act, 1949, in that, he being a trained

         soldier, did not secure his service weapon i.e. 5.56 mm Insas Rifle Butt No.412, Body
         No.17479191, and kept the safety mechanism on automation after cocking the rifle,
         which led to firing of 05 rounds from his service weapon accidentally on 19/4/06 at
         about 2000 hrs resulting in injury No.740280082 HC/GD Joginder Singh amounting to
         gross negligence in performance of duty and non-adherence of laid down instructions
         and basic principles regarding handling of arms and ammunition expected out of a
         trained soldier.”
3.       In his reply dated 5.1.2007 (Annexure-D), the petitioner stated that when he
was responding to the querry of the Head Constable, there was accidental firing from
his riffle and assuring that such negligence will never be repeated in future, the
constable applied for pardon. Dissatisfied with the explanation furnished by the
delinquent, the Deputy Commandant was appointed as the Inquiry Officer to inquire
into the allegation against the Head Constable and the Constable.
4.       During the joint departmental inquiry, the delinquent again admitted to the
charges and declined any defence assistance. However the Inquiry Officer took note of
the evidence given by the witnesses and concluded that, against the Head Constable,
the 1st charge was not proved and the 2nd charge was partially proved. But in so far as
the constable is concerned, both the charges were held to have been established in the
report of the Inquiry Officer, furnished on 4.4.2007 (Annexure-F).
5.       The finding of the Inquiry Officer was considered by the disciplinary authority
and he took note of the statement of the Havaldar R. Morar S.S. Murti and held that if
the delinquent Head Constable as the Guard Commander inspected the arms of the men
under his command, such incident would not occurred. Accordingly the supervisory
lapses of the Head Constable were held to be established. Similarly noticing the
relatively minor injury suffered by the Head Constable, his failure to immediately report
the firing incident to the higher ups was considered to be sufficient to prove the lapses
under Charge No.1 and accordingly the disciplinary authority disagreed with the
favourable conclusion reached against the delinquent Head Constable by the Inquiry
Officer.
6.       While assessing the lapses of the delinquent constable, the disciplinary authority
observed that the trained constable should have taken due care to inspect his weapon
and to keep his rifle in the safe mode and accordingly his lapses leading to the gun shot
injury to the Head Constable was held to be a matter of gross negligence in
performance of duty. Reflecting upon the post facto conduct of the delinquent, the
disciplinary authority opined that there was no mitigating circumstances in favour of the
constable and he deserves harshest punishment.
Writ Petition (C) No.595/2009                                                     Page 3 of 7

7.       On the basis of the above conclusion reached against the two delinquents, the
punishment of compulsory retirement was ordered against the Head Constable, whereas
the Constable was ordered to be dismissed from service, through the common order
passed by the disciplinary authority on 18.7.2007 (Annexure-G).
8.       An Appeal was preferred by the Constable against the dismissal order where he
applied for reinstatement by projecting that the delinquent honestly admitted his lapses
at every stage of the proceeding and projecting that it was a human error, the constable
applied for a lenient punishment so that his livelihood never threatened. The dissimilar
and less stringent punishment imposed upon the Head Constable was also pleaded as a
ground for the Appeal. But the Appellate Authority through the impugned order dated
24.10.2007 (Annexure-H), focused his attention on the lapses of the constable in mis-
handling the weapon and without referring to the specific grounds pleaded by the
delinquent, the constable’s Appeal was rejected as being devoid of merit. A Revision
Petition was then filed by the delinquent but the same was rejected on 28.2.2008
(Annexure-I) by the IGP, CRPF.
9.1.     Mr. KP Sarma, the learned senior counsel submits that because of the failure of
the constable to keep his rifle in the safe mode and the failure of the Head Constable as
the Guard Commander to ensure that the men under his command keep their riffle in
safe mode, the incident had occurred and thererore it is argued that for similar lapses,
the punishment should not be different and accordingly proportionality of the measure
of punishment on the constable is being questioned by the senior counsel.
9.2.     The petitioner submits that he honestly admitted his lapses at the very first
opportunity in his reply of 5.1.2007 (Annexure-D) and this according to Mr. Sarma
reflects the remorse felt by the constable. But this aspect was overlooked by the
disciplinary authority, who opted for the harsher punishment by overlooking the post
facto honest admission of the delinquent and accordingly it is argued that harsher
punishment is undeservingly imposed on the constable.
9.3.     The senior counsel refers to the 32 years service of the Head Constable as
compared to the 3 years service of the constable and projects that the supervisory
lapses of the Guard Commander is not of lesser consequences, as compared to the
personal lapses of the Constable for the incident in question and accordingly it is argued
that the delinquent deserves similar treatment as was given to the co-delinquent Head
Constable.
10.      Parity of punishment with co-delinquent is emphasized by the Apex Court when
charges are similar and the precise legal position on the issue can be gathered from the
Writ Petition (C) No.595/2009                                                Page 4 of 7

pronouncement of the Supreme Court in (2008) 2 SCC 74 (Akhilesh Kumar Singh vs.
State of Jharkhand), (2006) 6 SCC 548 (Anand Regional Coop. Oil Seedgrowers’ Union
Ltd. vs. Shaileshkumar Harshadbhai Shah) and (1998) 2 SCC 407 (Director General of
Police vs. G. Dasayan).
11.      On the issue of proportionality of punishment, the Apex Court in Om Kumar vs.
Union of India reported in (2001) 2 SCC 386 had opined that for examining the decision
of the departmental authority, the Court should verify whether punishment was imposed
by ignoring the relevant factors or whether the penalty imposed is one, which no
reasonable person could have inflicted for the lapses in question. Whenever the Court as
the reviewing authority finds that the decision does not satisfy the test of reasonable
person as is commonly understood as the Wednesbury Principle, the interference of the
Court is found to be justified. Similarly in Union of India vs. Dwarka Prasad Tiwari
reported in (2006) 10 SCC 388, the Apex Court observed that when the decision of the
departmental authority shocks the conscience of the Court or is in defiance of logic, the
Court can interfere by reflecting on the deficiencies in the decision making process.
12.      For applying the above legal principles to this case, it must be kept in mind that
this was a common disciplinary proceeding against two delinquents. The responsibility
of the constable was to keep his riffle in the safe mode and the responsibility of the
Guard Commander is to ensure that the men under his command, keep their weapons
in safe mode. Failure of both delinquents was noticed in respect of their jurisdictional
responsibilities. Yet the constable was punished with dismissal, whereas the punishment
of compulsory retirement was initially inflicted on the Head Constable by the disciplinary
authority and subsequently he was taken back in service. This in my view, amounts to
discriminatory treatment for the two co-delinquents, who committed similar lapses.
13.      That apart, the punishment of compulsory retirement for the Head Constable
was substituted subsequently by the Appellate Authority and while the exact details are
not available, the delinquent Head Constable Joginder Singh was not rendered jobless.
But while such leniency was shown despite the supervisory lapses committed by the
very experienced Head Constable, the Appellate Authorities failed to take into account
the irrational choice of harsher treatment for the constable, with much lesser service
exposure.
14.      That apart, the disciplinary authority, in my understanding went awfully wrong in
assessing the post facto conduct of the delinquent constable by declaring that he
deserves harsher punishment. When the delinquent constable honestly admitted his
lapses and stayed true to his first response at all stages and did not even defend the
Writ Petition (C) No.595/2009                                                 Page 5 of 7

charges, the authorities should have considered this to be a mitigating factor for a
lenient treatment. But neither the disciplinary authority nor the Appellate Authorities
took into account the honest and straight forward approach of the delinquent constable.
15.      Furthermore, the consequences of the lapses of the Head Constable is clearly
discernable from the testimony of the Havaldar R. Morar S.S. Murti and from his
evidence it is clear that the incident could have been avoided, if the Head Constable as
a Guard Commander had performed his supervisory duty, for the men under his
command. If there was lapses on the part of the man in failing to check the safety
mode of the weapon, similar lapses is clearly discernable against the Guard Commander
to inspect the arms of the men and therefore I believe that the lapses of both
delinquents are on similar footing and different treatment for the two is unjustified. But
this aspect was never considered by the disciplinary authority while deciding on the
punishment for the two co-delinquents.
16.      Confronted with the above situation and noticing that dissimilar treatment was
meted out for the two co-delinquents, who are charged under similar circumstances, I
hold that the punishment of dismissal for the delinquent constable was not reasonable
as the same in the fact of this case, shocks the conscience of the Court. In view of this
conclusion, the impugned order dated 18.7.2007 (Annexure-G) of the disciplinary
authority; the consequential order of the Appellate Authority passed on 24.10.2007
(Annexure-H) and of the Revisional Authority’s order passed on 28.2.2008 (Annexure-I),
are held to be vitiated and the same are quashed.
17.      The matter is thus remitted back to the disciplinary authority for reconsideration
by taking into account the mitigating factor and also the treatment meted out to the
Head Constable Joginder Singh, who was the co-delinquent in the common disciplinary
proceeding. A decision should thus be taken on this matter within 8 weeks of receipt of
a copy of this order. If fitness is not an obstacle, the constable should be taken back in
service. It is ordered accordingly.
18.      With the above order, the case stands allowed to the extent indicated, without
any order on cost.
                                                                                   JUDGE
