BISWANATH RATH, J. These appeals are directed against the order dated order
           dated 24.2.2012 passed by the State Education Tribunal, Bhubaneswar
           in G.I.A. Case Nos. 501 and 503 of 2011, on the ground that instead of
           adjudicating the matter, the learned Tribunal has remitted the matter
           back to the appellate authority for consideration of the grant-in-aid
           matter fixing the time limit in the impugned order, which is without
           jurisdiction.
           2.               The short fact of the case in hand is that one G.C. Rout
           (husband of the appellant) was duly appointed against the 2nd post of
           Lecturer in Sociology by the Governing Body of S.S.B. College,
           Mahakalpada, district Kendrapara on 20.11.1985 and he joined on
           25.11.1985.               The Governing Body of the college also appointed
           respondent no.4 against the 2nd post of Lecturer in Sociology, on which
           she joined on 25.11.1985, the date of joining of G.C. Rout (husband of

                                 -2-
the appellant).    The respondent no.1 vide letter dated 29.1.1999
(Anexure-5) allowed G.C. Rout (husband of the appellant) to receive
GIA against the 2nd post of Lecturer in Sociology and rejected the claim
of the respondent no.4 against the same.           The said order was
challenged by respondent no.4 in O.J.C. No. 2896 of 1999 to quash the
order under letter dated 29.1.1999 (Anexure-5) passed by respondent
No.1 and to approve her appointment w.e.f. 25.11.1985 as against the
2nd post of Lecturer in Sociology and to release the salary component
accordingly which was contested by G.C. Rout (husband of the
appellant). The name of G.C. Rout (husband of the appellant) was
validated from 1.6.1987 vide order dated 9.1.2001 (Annexure-6) passed
by the respondent no.1. The said order was challenged by respondent
no.4 in O.J.C. No. 9190 of 2001 for quashing the impugned order dated
9.1.2001 (Annexure-6) passed by the respondent no.1 and to direct the
respondents to validate her service as against the 2nd post of Lecturer in
Sociology.     Pursuant to the letter dated 9.2.2001 (Annexure-7)
addressed by respondent no.1 to the Director (respondent no.2)
cancelled the order of regularizing G.C. Rout (husband of the appellant)
under Validation Act. The said order was assailed by G.C. Rout (husband
of the appellant) in O.J.C. No. 3019 of 2001 which was disposed of on
19.4.2001 setting aside the impugned order dated 9.2.2001 reviving the
order of approval dated 9.1.2001 which fact was intimated to
respondent no.3 on 20.8.2001. Respondent no.1 vide letter dated
20.7.2005 (Annexure-9) approved the post of the G.C. Rout (husband of
the appellant) for payment of GIA. On 24.7.2008 G.C. Rout (husband of
the appellant) suddenly expired. The Hon’ble Court transferred the two
writ petitions, OJC Nos. 2896/1999 and 9190/2001 to the Tribunal on
the ground that the matters relate to GIA as per section 24(b) of the
Orissa Education Act.   The said writ petitions are renumbered as GIA
Case Nos. 501 and 503 of 2011. The Tribunal disposed of the said GIA
Cases directing respondent no.1 to enquire into the claim of G.C. Rout
(husband of the appellant) and respondent no.4 within a period of three
months from the date of receipt of order and dispose of the same in

                                 -3-
accordance    with  law   by  passing  a   speaking   order  after   giving
opportunity of hearing to the parties. The case of the appellant is that
she was neither noticed nor any of her legal heirs were substituted. The
order passed by the Tribunal is under challenge whereas separate writ
the order of the respondent no.1 is under challenge in writ petition.
3.          The learned Presiding Officer, State Educational Tribunal was
not satisfied with the materials available on record. The papers relating
to the recruitment process are not available in the Institution and are
missing for which, in the interest of justice, in the interest of justice,
referred    the   matter   vide   the   impugned     judgment     to    the
respondent-state government to decide the claim adhering the principle
of natural justice.
4.         Mr. Panda, learned counsel for the appellants assails the
judgment passed by the learned Tribunal on the ground that the learned
Presiding Officer, State Educational Tribunal instead of deciding the
matter in conformity with the provisions contained in Section 24-B of
the Orissa Education Act could not have remanded the matter to the
respondent no.1 directing them to dispose of the GIA matter within
three moths from the date of communication of the order.                 He
vehemently urged that without adjudicating the dispute, the learned
Presiding Officer, State Educational Tribunal has no authority to remit
the matter back to the State for consideration and law does not permit
the Tribunal to remit the matter back to the authority for consideration
instead of adjudicating the same on his own.
5.         Mr. S. Das, learned Additional Standing Counsel on the
otherhand supported the impugned order passed by the Tribunal. He
states that by due application of mind the impugned judgments have
been passed, therefore, this Court may not interfere with the same and
seeks for dismissal of the appeals.
6.         The very nomenclature of Section 24-B of the Odisha
Education Act indicates “Adjudication by Tribunal”. The said provisions
has been considered by this Court in Jitendra Kishore Baghasingh and
others v. State of Orissa and others : 2008 (Supp.-I) OLR 316 : 105

                                    -4-
(2008) CLT 330 : AIR 2008 Ori. 56, wherein this Court observed as
follows :
           “Matter relating to or connected with –
           (i)     Eligibility
           (ii)    Entitlement
           (iii)   Payment
           (iv)    Non-payment of grant-in-aid and
           (v)     The dispute thereof
           (a)     Between the Managing Committee/Governing Body
                   of private educational institution versus teachers or
                   employees of such institution, or
           (b)     Between Managing Committee/Governing Body of
                   private educational institution versus the State Govt.
                   or any officer or authority of the said Government,
           shall be within the competency of Orissa State Educational
           Tribunal to consider the dispute.”
and considering the said provision, it was held by this Court that
adjudication of disputes relating to GIA being within the competency of
State Educatioinal Tribunal, it is not proper to decide the same even in
extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India.
7.             This    Court    while   considering     the   provisions  of
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 in Dr. Prafulla Kumar Sahoo v. State
of Orissa and two others, 2009 (II) OLR 709 held as follows :
           “ It is due to failure on the part of the Administrative
           Authority to give justice to such claim of persons, who
           were in Govt. service, the legislatures thought it proper to
           enact the Administrative Tribunal Act, and the
           Administrative Tribunals were created another reason for
           the same is to reduce the burden of the High Court which
           was flooded with cases relating to service matters. From
           the action of the Tribunal in sending back the matter to the
           Government, it appears that the Administrative Tribunal is
           acting like a Post Office and not adjudicating the case as
           the statute demands.”

                                   -5-
8.          Similar view has also been taken by the apex court in State
of West Bengal v. Subhas Kumar Chatterjee and others, AIR 2010 SC
2927, wherein it is held as follows :
           “Whether the Administrative Tribunal can delegate its
           power to judicial review and confer the same upon a Chief
           Engineer ? The Tribunals cannot travel beyond the power
           conferred on them and delegate their essential function
           and duty to decide service related disputes.             Such
           delegation is as initio void. It is too elementary to re-state
           that no judicial tribunal can delegate its responsibilities
           except where it is authorized to do so expressly. The
           power conferred upon the Administrative Tribunals under
           the provisions of the said Act flows from Article 323-A of
           the Constitution. Such power can never be delegated
           except under a valid law made by parliament.              The
           tribunals by their own act cannot delegate the power to
           decide any dispute which in law is required to be decided
           exclusively by such tribunals.”
9.          In view of such position, if the statute vests a power with the
Tribunal to adjudicate the dispute the disputes with regard to eligibility
of grant-in-aid, it could not have divested the said power by passing the
impugned order. It is well settled principle of law laid down by the Privy
Council in Nazir Ahmad v. King Emperor, 1936 PC 253 and
subsequently followed by the Apex Court in Municipal Corporation of
Delhi v. Jagdish Lal and another, AIR 1970 SC 7; Ramchandra
Keshav Adke (Dead) by Lrs. V. Govind Joti Chavare and others,
AIR 1975 SC 915 and Babu Verghese and others v. Bar Council of
Kerala and others, AIR 1999 SC 1281 and various Courts that if the
statute prescribes a thing to be done in a particular manner, the same
should be done in the same manner or not at all.
10.        For the reasons as aforesaid, this Court is of the considered
opinion that the impugned judgment passed by the learned Tribunal
cannot be sustained. Therefore, the judgment dated 24.2.2012 passed
by the learned Tribunal in G.I.A. Case Nos. 501 & 503 of 2011 out of
which FAO Nos. 186 and 187 of 2014 arises, is hereby quashed. The
matter is remitted back to the Tribunal to re-hear the G.I.A. Case Nos.

                                -6-
 501 & 503 of 2011 afresh and dispose of the same after giving due
 opportunity to the parties. The Tribunal is directed to do well in
 disposing of the GIA Cases under remand by the end of December,
 2014. The petitioner is directed to produce a copy of the order before
 the Tribunal by 5.9.2014 and the Tribunal is to act on the same.
            With the above observation and direction, the appeals are
 allowed.
                                                       ………………………
