                  JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL )
        In this appeal under Section 30 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act,
1923 (now renamed as Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923), the insurance
company has challenged the judgment and award dated 30.03.2006 passed by
the Commissioner, Workmen’s Compensation, Dhubri in W.C. Case No. 2/2004.
By this judgment and award, the W.C. Commissioner has directed the insurance
company to make payment of Rs. 1,77,904/- to the claimant and the owner of
the vehicle has been directed to make payment of Rs. 50,703/- towards interest
on compensation. While the insurance company has preferred MFA No. 65/2006
challenging the judgment and award dated 30.03.2006 in entirety, the owner,
namely, Narayan Chandra Saha has preferred MFA No. 51/2006 against the
decision of the W.C. Commissioner directing the owner to make payment of
interest component of the impugned judgment and award. Since, both the
appeals are directed against two parts of the same judgment and award, both
the appeals are taken up together for disposal.
2.      One Narayan Mondal filed a claim petition before the W.C. Commissioner
at Dhubri leading to registration of W.C. Case No. 2/2004. The claimant stated
that he was appointed as conductor in the bus bearing registration No. AS-19-
1687 belonging to the opposite party No. 1, Narayan Chandra Saha and that he
was paid monthly salary of Rs. 500/- along with daily allowance of Rs. 70/-.
According to the claimant, while the vehicle was moving from Guwahati to Dhubri
on 01.02.2003, it met with an accident near Deuduar under Kamalpur Police
                                                                    Page 3 of 10

MFA 51/2006

Station due to mechanical defect. The claimant sustained multiple injuries on his
person because of the accident and became permanently and partially disabled.
He was taken to Deka Clinic at Baihata for preliminary treatment and thereupon
he was shifted to Dhubri for treatment. He was treated by Dr. RK Mahato, who
referred him to Orthopeadic Surgeon. Thereafter he received treatment at
Vevekananda Nursing Home at Patna. According to the claimant, he sustained
injuries on left hand, left leg and other parts of the body.
3.      Kamalpur Police Station made G.D. Entry No. 812 dated 01.02.2003 and
G.D. Entry No. 386 on 04.02.2003 in connection with the aforesaid incident. On
being summoned, the O.P. No. 1 and 2 appeared and submitted written
statement. O.P. No. 1 being the owner of the vehicle admitted employment of
the claimant under him and stated that he used to pay Rs. 500/- to the claimant
per month as salary and Rs. 70/- as daily allowance. The O.P. No. 2, on the other
hand, appeared and denied liability of making any payment. Usual objection as to
maintainability and bar under Section 10 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act
apart from quantum of salary and correctness of accident etc. were taken in the
written statement of the insurance company.
4.      On the basis of the rival contentions of the parties, the W.C.
Commissioner framed following 4 (four) issues and asked the parties to lead their
respective evidence.
                 (1)    Is there any cause of action for the claim petition?
                 (2)    Whether the claim petition is maintainable in its present form?
                 (3)    Whether the O.Ps are liable to pay compensation as claimed by
                        the claimant petitioner?
                                                                               Page 4 of 10
MFA 65/2006
MFA 51/2006

                (4)    If yes, what relief is the claimant petitioner entitled to?
5.      Claimant examined himself as PW 1 and proved Accident Information
Report as Ext. 1, certificate from Deka Clinic as Ext. 2, prescription as Ext. 3,
medical certificate from Patna as Ext. 4 and another prescription as Ext. 5. He
also adduced Pathological Research Report as Ext. 6 and another prescription
from Patna as Ext. 7. The vouchers from Patna were exhibited as Exts. 8 to 19,
copy of railway ticket as Ext. 20, copy of tourist contract list of Joy Travels as
Ext. 21 and notice under Section 10 served to the opposite parties was exhibited
as Ext. 22. Apart from that, three X-ray plates were adduced as material exhibits
to prove that there was an accident and that he sustained injuries in such
accident.
6.      The claimant did not examine any qualified medical practitioner. Under
such circumstances, O.P. No. 2, the insurance company submitted an application
before the W.C. Commissioner craving leave to take steps for bringing a doctor
for examination but the W.C. Commissioner appears to have rejected this
application by an order dated 24.02.2006 and thus, there was no assessment by
qualified medical practitioner as required under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923.
7.      The W.C. Commissioner after considering the materials available before
him passed the impugned judgment and award on 30.03.2006 thereby holding
that there was cause of action for the claim petition, that the claim petition was
maintainable in the present form and that the opposite parties are liable to pay
compensation. The W.C. Commissioner himself made the assessment on the
                                                                                 Page 5 of 10
MFA 65/2006
MFA 51/2006

basis of the medical report that the claimant sustained physical disability due to
which he lost earning capacity to the extent of 35%. Since, the claimant claimed
to be 28 years of age at the time of accident, the compensation was assessed as
follows:
               35% x Rs. 2400 x 211.79 = Rs. 1,77,904/-
        Over and above, interest amounting to Rs. 50,703/- has also been
imposed on the aforesaid amount. The W.C. Commissioner directed the
insurance company to make payment of the principal compensation of Rs.
1,77,904/- and the owner has been directed to make payment of interest to the
tune of Rs. 50,703/-. This is how two appeals came to be filed both by the
insurance company as well as by the owner of the vehicle.
8.      I have heard Mr. A Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant in MFA No.
65/2006 and Mr. S Katakey, learned counsel for the appellant in MFA No.
51/2006. None appears for the claimant although name of Mr. MJ Barman has
been shown in the cause list. I have perused the lower court records.
9.      At the time of admission of both the appeals no substantial question of
law was framed as required under section 30 of the Workmen’s Compensation
Act, 1923. Under such circumstances, both the learned counsel are heard today
to find out as to whether any substantial question of law does arise in the
present set of two appeals. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and
on perusal of the records, the following sole substantial question of law is framed
in both these appeals:-
                                                                         Page 6 of 10
MFA 65/2006
MFA 51/2006

        “Whether impugned judgment and award is vitiated for non-examination
        of qualified medical practitioner as required under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of
        the Workmen’s Compensation Act?”
10.     While it is not disputed that claimant was employed by the owner O.P.
No. 1 of the W.C. Case and that he had sustained injury owing to the motor
vehicular accident and that he used to receive Rs. 500/- as monthly salary and
Rs. 70/- as daily allowance, the physical disability and the loss of earning
capacity of the claimant is not admitted by either of the opposite parties. Under
such circumstances, there is no doubt that the claimant became entitled to
compensation under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) or 4(1)(d) of the W.C. Compensation Act,
1923, inasmuch as, none of the injuries referred to in the medical certificate is
mentioned in Part I or II of Schedule I to the Act. Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the
Workmen’s Compensation Act requires that in such case the loss of earning
capacity is to be assessed on the basis of the opinion of qualified medical
practitioner. In the case in hand, the claimant has not examined the person who
issued the medical certificate and merely produced the certificate to show that he
sustained physical disability and loss of earning capacity. Situated thus, the
insurance company submitted an application for examining a qualified medical
practitioner for the purpose of assisting the W.C. Commissioner for arriving at a
finding in regard to quantum of loss of earning capacity of the claimant but that
attempt of the insurance company has been sat at not by the W.C. Commissioner
by an order dated 24.02.2006. Under such circumstances, there was no material
as required under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923
                                                                        Page 7 of 10

MFA 51/2006

before the jurisdictional W.C. Commissioner to arrive at a finding as to loss of
earning capacity of the claimant. The W.C. Commissioner relied on the
certificates and made assessment at his own accord which does not appear to be
in conformity with the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and various
High Courts of the country.
11.      Mr. A Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant in MFA No. 65/2006, has
placed reliance in the case of Kamla Chaturvedi v. National Insurance Company
and others reported in (2009) 1 SCC 487, National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sh.
Lalropara and another reported in (2010) 1 GLR 826, Narayan Chakraborty v.
Swapan Debnath and another reported in (2007) 4 GLR 732 and Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Lalliansawmi and another reported in (2010) 2 GLR 399.
While Kamla Chaturvedi (supra) has laid down the law in regard to liability of the
insurance company to make payment of interest along with compensation
amount, the other three judgments relate to law requiring examination of
qualified medical practitioner for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of loss
of earning capacity of the claimants. In the case of Narayan Chakraborty (supra),
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. (supra) and National Insurance Co. Ltd. (supra), this
court held that complainant/claimant is duty bound to examine the doctor who
issued the certificate. Out of the aforesaid three cases, the case of Narayan
Chakraborty (supra) is a claim case under Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923
and this court has held in this case that evidence of a medical witness is a
condition precedent for assessment of disability of the insured person for
ascertaining the loss of earning capacity. In that case, it was held that W.C.
                                                                        Page 8 of 10
MFA 65/2006
MFA 51/2006

Commissioner is not entitled to assess the disability factor only on the basis of
the certificate issued by a doctor unless such doctor has not been examined as
witness. This judgment appears to govern the present case. Even in the present
case, the claimant did not make any attempt to examine the qualified medical
practitioner and merely relied on the medical certificate issued by doctors. On the
other hand, insurance company did its part by submitting application before the
W.C. Commissioner praying for leave to take steps for calling a qualified medical
practitioner so as to assist the court in regard to assessment of loss of earning
capacity but unfortunately, the W.C. Commissioner did not allow the application.
Under such circumstances, the impugned judgment and award passed by the
W.C. Commissioner does not appear to be in conformity with the provision of
Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 and as such, the
sole substantial question of law is decided in favour of the appellants and against
the claimant. The impugned judgment and award, therefore, is hereby set aside
and the matter is remanded to the W.C. Commissioner for affording adequate
opportunities to the parties to get a qualified medical practitioner examined for
the purpose of proving disability, loss of earning capacity and for assessing loss
of earning capacity of the claimant. Since it is a case of 2003, the learned W.C.
Commissioner shall endeavour to complete the whole process within a period of
6 (six) months from the date of receipt of the records. Send down the records
immediately.
12.     The insurance company and the owner shall appear before the W.C.
Commissioner on 2 nd Novem ber, 2015 to receive necessary orders and
                                                                         Page 9 of 10
MFA 65/2006
MFA 51/2006

thereupon the W.C. Commissioner shall issue notice to the claimant for
appearance. This is because although claimant was represented in these appeals
but no one has put up appearance when the matter is called up for hearing.
Appeals stand allowed.
13.     No order as to costs.
14.     At this stage, the learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. A Sharma,
submits that there was an interim order by this court but whole amount was
deposited by the insurance company. Under such circumstances, no amount shall
be disbursed to the workman, if not already disbursed, till the matter is
adjudicated afresh.
                                                                     JUDGE
