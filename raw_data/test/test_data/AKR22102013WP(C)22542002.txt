                      THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE M.M. DAS
                                           AND
                     THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K. RATH
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of Hearing: 24.09.2013 │ Date of Judgment:22.10.2013
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         The petitioners have called in question the legality
      and propriety of the order dated 10.12.2001 passed by the learned

                                   2
Orissa Administrative Tribunal, Cuttack Bench, Cuttack (hereinafter
referred to as “Tribunal”) in O.A. No.3414(C) of 1999 vide
Annexure-14. By the said order, learned Tribunal came to hold that
the Office Memorandum dated 16.12.1992 shall hold the field in the
matter of recruitment of the Officers of Orissa Soil Conservation
Service and the quota of direct recruitment shall be worked out
according    to  the  provisions   laid down    in  the  said   Office
Memorandum, within one year from the date of receipt of the order
after which the merit list prepared by Orissa Public Service
Commission (in short “OPSC”) shall outlive its validity.
2.           This case has a chequered history. Several cases were
filed by different employees at different point of time before the
learned Tribunal. Some of the cases had travelled from this Court to
the Hon’ble Supreme Court. But then, the subject matter of dispute
still remains quandary. Initially under the Agriculture Department,
there was only one Directorate, namely, Director of Agriculture and
Food Production. Thereafter, the Directorate of Horticulture and
Directorate of Soil Conservation were created in the year 1977 and
1978 respectively. With regard to the recruitment to the Class-II
(present Group-B) posts under the Directorate of Soil Conservation,
no rule under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India has
been framed till yet. On 13.07.1976, the Government had issued a

                                    3
letter to the Director of Agriculture and Food Production prescribing
the guidelines with regard to the method of recruitment to the posts
of Asst. Soil Conservation Officers (hereinafter referred as “ASCOs”).
After creation of Directorate of Soil Conservation, on 30.03.1982
another letter was issued by the Government to the Director of Soil
Conservation     (hereinafter   referred    as   “1982     instructions”)
prescribing the method of recruitment to the post of ASCOs vide
Annexure-1. The said letter provides that 50% of the vacancies
arising in a year on the 1st day of August of the year in which the
vacancy arises, shall be filled up by direct recruitment by persons
having qualifications prescribed therein and the remaining 50% of
the vacancies shall be filled up by promotion from amongst the
Senior Soil Conservation Assistants on fulfilling the requisite criteria
mentioned therein. Clause 2 of the notification provides that the
principles  enumerated     therein   shall  remain   in  force    till the
recruitment rules in pursuance of the proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution of India are framed or till any further instructions are
issued by the Government, whichever is earlier. The said letter was
issued in supersession of the earlier letter dated 13.07.1976. A
group of Asst. Soil Conservation Assistants filed O.A. No.131/1988
before   the   learned  Tribunal   praying   therein   that   the    entire
recruitment should be done by way of promotion from the rank of
Soil  Conservation    Assistants.  A   challenge   was   made      to  the

                                   4
prescription of 1:1 ratio between the direct recruits and promotees
in the grade of ASCOs as fixed by 1982 instructions. By order dated
6.5.1991, learned Tribunal dismissed the said O.A.
3.          While the matter stood thus, the State Government
issued   an  Office Memorandum       dated   16.12.1992   (hereinafter
referred to as “1992 Office Memorandum”) vide Annexure-2 for
regulating the matters of recruitment to the posts and conditions of
service of the persons appointed to the Orissa Soil Conservation
Services.   On a conspectus of the 1992 Office Memorandum, it is
evident that pending framing of rules for regulating the matters of
recruitment to the posts and conditions of service of the persons
appointed to the Orissa Soil Conservation Service under proviso to
Article 309 of the Constitution of India, the Government have
decided to issue the said executive instructions.
4.          Clause 4(2) of the 1992 Office Memorandum provides
that the recruitment to the posts in Soil Conservation Service, Class-
II shall be made by direct recruitment in accordance with rule 5;
and by promotion from among the Junior Soil Conservation Officers
in accordance with rule 6.
            Clause 5(1) provides that recruitment in any year to the
Soil Conservation Service, Class-II shall be made by way of direct
recruitment and promotion in the ratio of 1:2. Clause 5(2) provides

                                  5
that the number of direct recruits and promotees in the Orissa Soil
Conservation Service, Class-II shall be reviewed every three years
and upon such review necessary adjustment shall be made to
maintain the ratio mentioned in sub-rule (1). Clause 17 provides
that all rules, orders and instructions hereto in force pertaining to
and in conflict with subject matter of any of the provisions of these
rules are hereby repealed.
5.           The 1992 Office Memorandum was challenged by one
Rusi Guman Singh, working as Assistant Soil Conservation Officer,
Khurda in O.A. No.27/93 before the learned Tribunal. By an interim
order dated 11.11.1993, learned Tribunal granted interim stay on
the operation of the 1992 Office Memorandum. However, by an
interim order, learned Tribunal directed that the authorities might
give ad hoc appointment. Finally, the said O.A. was disposed of as
withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh application. Pursuant to the
interim order passed in O.A. No.27/93, the State Government had
promoted 18 JAOs and 5 JAEs to the rank of ASCOs on ad hoc basis.
Challenging such ad hoc appointments to the rank of ASCOs, two Jr.
Soil Conservation Officers filed O.A. No.931/96 before the learned
Tribunal. As the term of the ad hoc appointees had expired, learned
Tribunal disposed of the said O.A. along with other O.As., such as
O.A. Nos.932/96, 943/96, 963/96 and 981/96 respectively as

                                   6
infructuous on 2.4.1997 with the observation that the draft rules
should be sent to the OPSC for finalisation within a fortnight. It was
further observed that the existing 24 vacancies ought to be filled up
in consultation with the OPSC in accordance with 1982 instructions.
It was also observed that pending selection of candidates in
consultation with the OPSC, ad hoc appointments were to be made
following the provisions of ORV Act.
6.           While the matter stood thus, one Laxman Kumar Barik
and others filed O.A. No.1148/97 before the learned Tribunal
praying for a direction to carry out the stipulation in the 1992 Office
Memorandum with regard to the direct recruitment and promotion in
the rank of ASCOs. Learned Tribunal directed the applicants therein
to make representations to the State Government in that behalf and
disposed of the aforesaid O.A. Again another Original Application
being O.A. No.756/1999 was filed before the learned Tribunal
challenging inter alia the appointment of one Bipin Bihari Mallick, an
I.A.S. Officer to the post of Director, Soil Conservation. Challenge
was made on the ground that there was no provision for posting of
an I.A.S. Officer as Director of Soil Conservation. There was no
statutory rules governing the method of recruitment, but in the
1992 Office Memorandum, the State Government have issued
certain executive instructions. The said O.A. was disposed of on

                                    7
29.6.1999 holding inter alia that the executive instructions were
issued pending framing of rules governing the matters relating to
recruitment of Soil Conservation Officers and since the 1992 Office
Memorandum are in the nature of executive instructions under
Article 166 of the Constitution of India, they are binding on all
concerned until rules under Article 309 of the Constitution of India
are framed. The learned Tribunal held that the 1992 Office
Memorandum embodied certain executive instructions governing the
method     of   recruitment,   conditions  of   service etc.  of  Soil
Conservation Officers in the State and these would remain binding
till these were repealed by an Act or Rules made under Article 309
of the Constitution of India or the proviso there to.
7.            At this juncture, one Hemanta Kumar Das and others,
who were working as Jr. Soil Conservation Officers filed O.A.
No.2473/1999 before the learned Tribunal praying for a direction to
the State Government to apply the provisions contained in the 1992
Office Memorandum governing the matters relating to recruitment
to Soil Conservation Service, that the instructions laid down in the
1982 instructions had no application and to quash the advertisement
No.2 of    1998-99 dated 27.5.1998 for recruitment to the post of
ASCOs. The       learned   Tribunal   dismissed   the aforesaid  O.A.
holding inter alia that     the   OPSC rightly followed    the   1982

                                  8
instructions and recommended 43 names and therefore, the
selection of the candidates made by the OPSC for direct recruitment
to the posts of ASCOs was legal and valid. While coming to the
finding, learned Tribunal relied upon the earlier directions made in
O.A. No.931/96 and similar other cases and the order dated
12.5.1998 passed by this Court in O.J.C. No.6012/98. Be it noted
that the order passed in O.A. No.931/96 was confirmed by this
Court by the aforesaid order. The learned Tribunal further observed
that this Court directed that the orders shall operate, even if any
order contrary to the order was passed by any authority including
the learned Tribunal. The matter went to Hon’ble Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court dismissed the SLP.
8.           It is apt to state here that while disposing of O.J.C.
No.6012 of 1998, this Court observed that the ad hoc appointments
are creating problems and against the spirit of the order passed by
the learned Tribunal and directed that till final decision is taken by
the OPSC, no ad hoc appointment shall be made. In Misc. Case
No.5017 of 1999 arising out of O.J.C. No.6012 of 1998, this Court
passed an order on 2.7.1999 that the State Government is free to
make appointment from the select list prepared by the OPSC and
the order shall operate even if any order to the contrary has been
passed by any authority including the learned Tribunal. Challenging

                                    9
the order dated 30.4.1999 passed in Misc. Case No.5017 of 1999,
two SLP Nos.12317 & 12318 of 1999 were filed by Sashi Bhusan
Pani and others before the Supreme Court. On 19.11.1999 the
Supreme Court, not being inclined to interfere with the order passed
by this Court, disposed of the said SLPs with an observation that the
impugned order of this Court does not in any way affect the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide the pending O.A. on its own
merit. Again another writ petition was filed before this Court being
O.J.C. No.15026 of 1999 by the opposite parties with a prayer to
dispose of the O.A. expeditiously. The said writ petition was
disposed of on 3.2.2000 with a direction to the learned Tribunal to
dispose of the O.A.
9.           While the matter stood thus, the opposite party no.4
filed O.A. No.3414(C) of 1999 before the learned Tribunal for a
direction to the State of Orissa to fill up the posts of ASCOs
according to the 1992 Office Memorandum by recasting the number
of vacancies meant for direct recruits. A further direction was sought
for to direct the State of Orissa not to fill up 28 posts in the cadre of
ASCOs by way of direct recruitment as per advertisement no.2 of
1998-99 issued by the OPSC. The case of the applicant is that he is
a Junior Soil Conservation Officer and is an aspirant to the post of
ASCO by direct recruitment, but his candidature as an in-service

                                   10
candidate was rejected at the time of verification. There is no
statutory rules for regulating the method of recruitment and
conditions   of   service  of  employees    of  the   Directorate.  In
supersession of the earlier instructions dated 13.7.1976, the
Government had issued fresh instructions on 30.3.1982. In 1998,
the OPSC had issued an advertisement on 27.5.1998 inviting
applications for recruitment to the posts of ASCOs. According to the
said advertisement, out of 28 posts, 18 posts were reserved. The
1982 instructions were repealed to the extent of inconsistency with
the 1992 Office Memorandum. The earlier ratio 50:50 between
direct recruits and promotees was changed to 1:2. The total posts of
ASCOs were 73, out of which 6 were abolished. So there remained a
cadre   strength    of  67  posts.  According  to   the  1992   Office
Memorandum, there should be 22 direct recruits and 45 promotees.
Since there were 13 direct recruits and 20 promotees in the cadre,
the balance 34 posts would be filled up in accordance with the 1992
Office Memorandum, i.e., 9 by direct recruits and 25 by promotees,
by maintaining the ratio of 1:2 between the direct recruits and
promotees. Therefore, the advertisement to fill up 28 posts by direct
recruitment is illegal.
10.          A counter affidavit was filed by the State of Orissa
contending inter alia that in O.A. No.931/96, the learned Tribunal

                                   11
misinterpreted the order dated 2.4.1997 that the 1992 Office
Memorandum draft rules and gave direction to forward the said draft
rules within a fortnight to the OPSC and to follow the 1982
instructions in making appointment to the post of ASCOs. The 1992
Office Memorandum was challenged in O.A. No.27/93 in which
learned   Tribunal    granted   interim   stay  on  the   said   Office
Memorandum.        Ultimately,   the   said   O.A.  was     withdrawn.
Furthermore, in the said Office Memorandum, the 1982 instructions
were repealed to the extent of repugnancy.
11.          After hearing the matter in extenso, learned Tribunal by
order dated 10.12.2001 allowed the O.A. holding inter alia that the
1992 Office Memorandum issued pending framing of rules under the
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution are executive orders or
executive instructions or at best administrative rules and not the
draft rules and these will hold the field in the matter of recruitment
etc. of the officers of the Orissa Soil Conservation Service and their
service conditions, till laws are made by the State Legislature under
Article 309 of the Constitution or the Governor makes rules in
exercise of the power conferred by proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution. The learned Tribunal further came to hold that these
executive instructions or administrative rules repealed the 1982
instructions by Clause 17 to the extent of its repugnancy and these

                                   12
rules cannot, therefore, be applicable to the matters of recruitment
and service conditions of Orissa Soil Conservation Officers. The
learned Tribunal further observed that the OPSC has already
prepared a list of 43 candidates in order of merit for recruitment
pursuant to advertisement no.28 of 1998-99 and notified the same
on 27.5.1999. Since the 1992 Office Memorandum shall hold the
field, the quota of direct recruitment shall be worked out according
to the provisions laid down in the executive instructions or
administrative rules and appointments be given to direct recruits to
the extent of their quota only, within one year from the date of
receipt of the order, after which the list shall outlive its validity. The
said order is impugned in the present writ petition.
12.          Pursuant to issuance of notice, one Braja Mohan Rout,
Deputy Secretary to Government, Agriculture Department has filed
counter affidavit on behalf of opposite party no.1 reiterating its
stand taken before the learned Tribunal.
13.          The OPSC-opposite party no.3 filed a counter affidavit.
The case of the opposite party no.3 is that on the basis of requisition
(with draft advertisement) and clarification submitted by the State
Government of Orissa in its Agriculture Department letter            dated
15.5.1996, 30.4.1997 and 13.5.1998 respectively, advertisement
no.2 of 1998-99 was issued by the OPSC for filling up 28 posts of

                                    13
ASCOs. There was no recruitment rule for filling up the aforesaid
post in question. The advertisement was issued prescribing the
eligibility conditions as per the Government Letter No.30.3.1982. In
response to the said advertisement, 375 applications including the
applications of the petitioners were received. After completion of
recruitment process, it submitted the recommendation in respect of
43 candidates in its letter dated 29.05.1999.
14.           Opposite   party  no.4,   applicant   before   the learned
Tribunal, also filed a counter affidavit reiterating the facts mentioned
in O.A. No.3414 (C) of 1999.
15.           We have heard Mr. Manoj Mishra, learned Senior
Advocate for the petitioners, Mr. J.P.Patnaik, learned Additional
Government Advocate for the State, Mr.A.K.Mishra, learned Senior
Advocate for opposite party no.4 and Mr.B.Routray, learned Senior
Advocate for opposite party no.10.
16.           In course of hearing, Mr. Manoj Mishra, learned Senior
Advocate submitted that the 1992 Office Memorandum is a draft
rule, which has been conclusively held by the learned Tribunal as
well as this Court and the 1982 instructions still hold the field. He
further submitted that the 1992 Office Memorandum having not
been acted upon by the Government, the same has been repealed

                                    14
quasily in view of law of desuetude. He further submitted that
opposite party no.4 having taken a calculative chance of appearing
at the interview, cannot challenge the selection process, merely
because the result is not palatable to him. There is gross delay and
latches on the part of opposite party no.4 in approaching the
learned Tribunal. He further submitted that the select list prepared
by the OPSC is still valid and necessary direction may be issued by
this Court to appoint the persons, who are in the select list.
17.          Per contra, Mr.A.K.Mishra, learned Senior Advocate
supported the order passed by the learned Tribunal and submitted
that the 1992 Office Memorandum is an Executive Instruction, which
supersedes 1982 instructions. In absence of recruitment rule framed
by the State Government, the 1992 Office Memorandum governs
the field, so far as matters relating to recruitment to Orissa Soil
Conservation Service. He further submitted that the advertisement
for filling up 28 posts of ASCOs is not in consonance with 1992
Executive Instructions in as much as only 9 posts could have been
filled up by way of direct recruitment. He further submitted that
validity of selection list prepared by the OPSC is one year, as would
be found from Clause 10.5 of the 1992 Office Memorandum and by
efflux of time, the same has expired.

                                    15
18.          Mr.J.P.Patnaik, learned Additional Government Advocate
submitted that order of the learned Tribunal holding that 1992
Executive Instructions are not draft rule, is perfectly legal and valid.
He further submitted that in an application under Section 227 of the
Constitution of India, this Court, in its supervisory jurisdiction should
not interfere with the order of the learned Tribunal, even if a
different view is possible, since there is no infirmity/illegality in the
order.
19.          Mr.B.Routray, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
opposite party no.10 adopted the argument made by Mr. Manoj
Mishra, learned Senior Advocate. He submitted that Rule-11 of the
Orissa Government Rules of Business clearly provides that all orders
or instruments made or executed by the order or on behalf of the
Government of Orissa shall be expressed to be made by order of or
executed in the name of the Governor of Orissa. He further
submitted that since 1992 Office Memorandum has not been issued
by the order of the Governor nor placed before the Cabinet as per
the procedure in part-III of the Rules of Business, the same cannot
be   treated  as    an   Executive  Instruction   and   as  such,   1982
instructions still hold the field.

                                    16
20.         On the rival pleadings and submissions made by the
learned counsel appearing for the respective parties, the following
points emerge for our consideration:-
            (1) Whether the 1992 Office Memorandum is a draft rule
                 or Executive Instruction governing the matters
                  relating to recruitment to Orissa Soil Conservation
                 Service?
            (2) Whether the select list prepared by OPSC is still
                  valid or have lapsed ?
            (3) Whether the opposite party no.4 has any locus
                 standi to file Original Application before the learned
                 Tribunal?
            (4) Whether the petitioners are entitled to any relief?
Point No.1
21.         In the case of Sant Ram Sharma Vrs. State of
Rajasthan, A.I.R. 1967 SC 1910, a Constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court held that the Government cannot amend or
supersede the statutory rules by administrative instructions, but if
the rules are silent on any particular point, the Government can fill
up the gap and supplement the rules and issue instructions not
inconsistent with the rules already framed. The same view has been
reiterated by another Constitution Bench in the case of Naga
People’s Movement of Human Rights Vrs. Union of India, AIR
1998 SC 431. In the said case, the Supreme Court held that the
Executive Instructions are binding, provided the same have been

                                   17
issued to fill up the gap between the statutory provisions and are
not inconsistent with the said provisions. Admittedly, no rule is
framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India. The
1982 Executive Instructions have been issued by the Agriculture and
Cooperation Department providing method of recruitment to the
post of ASCOs. Clause 2 of the said instructions provide that the
principles   enumerated    therein   shall remain   in   force  till the
recruitment rules in pursuance of the proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution of India are framed or till any further instructions are
issued by Government, whichever is earlier. While the matter stood
thus, the Government of Orissa in the Department of Agriculture
issued the 1992 Office Memorandum. The same provides that
pending framing of rules for the purpose of governing the matters
relating to recruitment to Soil Conservation Service under proviso to
Article 309 of the Constitution of India, Government have decided to
make     Executive  Instructions    for  regulating  the    matters   of
recruitment to the posts and conditions of service of the person
appointed to the Orissa Soil Conservation Service, which means
pending framing of rules under proviso          to Article 309 of the
Constitution of India, the Executive Instruction contained in the said
Office Memorandum would regulate the matters of recruitment to
the posts and conditions of service of the persons appointed to the
Orissa Soil Conservation Service. Though Mr. Routray, learned

                                    18
Senior Advocate submitted that since the 1992 Office Memorandum
has not been executed in the name of Governor of Orissa, the same
cannot be treated as an Executive Instruction in view of the Rule-11 of the
Rules of Business, with profound respect to the learned Senior
Advocate, it is difficult to comprehend the said contention. Both the
1982 Executive Instructions and the 1992 Office Memorandum have
been issued by the Agriculture Department, Government of Orissa.
Merely because the 1982 Executive Instructions, which have been
amended in the year 1998 and the amending instruction was issued
by the Under Secretary to Government of Orissa by the order of the
Governor, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the 1992
Office Memorandum have not been issued in accordance with Rule-
11 of the Rules of Business. At the cost of repetition, we reiterate
that   the  1982     Executive  Instructions     and   the   1992    Office
Memorandum have been issued by the Agriculture Department,
Government of Orissa.
22.          Next we will examine as to whether the 1992 Office
Memorandum stood repealed quasily in view of law of desuetude.
Desuetude is a legal process by which, through disobedience and
lack of enforcement over a long period, the statute loses its force
without express or implied repeal. In the case of Municipal
Corporation for City of Pune and another Vrs. Bharat Forge

                                   19
Co. Ltd. and others, (1995) 3 Supreme Court Cases 434, the
Supreme Court in paragraph-34 of the report held that though
in India the doctrine of desuetude does not appear to have
been used so far to hold that any statue has stood repealed because
of this process, there is no objection in principle to apply the said
doctrine to the statute of India. The Supreme Court further came to
hold that this is for the reason that a citizen should know whether,
despite a statute having been in disuse for long duration and instead
a contrary practice being in use, he is still required; to act as per the
“dead letter”. In the said case, the Supreme Court was called upon
to decide as to whether 1918 notification issued by the Government
of India imposing tax mentioned in the said notification or 1963 new
Octroi Rules will hold the field. While coming to the aforesaid
conclusion, their Lordships held that from the materials available on
record, 1918 notification has not been implemented till date and in
fact contrary practice has been followed for a long period. In the
said context, it is held that 1918 notification stood repealed quasily
by the time new Octroi Rules came to be framed in 1963. The said
doctrine has no application in the facts and circumstances of the
present case. It is true that 1982 Executive Instructions have been
amended in the year 1998, but then several appointments have
been made, such as, Director of Soil Conservation, in accordance
with the 1992 Office Memorandum. Since no contrary practice has

                                  20
been followed, we hold that the doctrine of desuetude has no
application in the instant case.
23.          Thus, the findings of the learned Tribunal that the said
Office Memorandum issued pending framing of rules under the
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, are the executive
orders or Executive Instructions or at best administrative rules and
not the draft rules and these will hold the field in the matter of
recruitment etc. of the Officers of the Orissa Soil Conservation
Service and their service conditions cannot be faulted. Clause 17 of
the 1992 Office Memorandum provides that all rules, orders and
instructions hereto in force and pertaining to and in conflict with
subject matter of any of the provisions of these rules would stand
repealed. Thus, the 1992 Office Memorandum expressly repealed
the 1982 instructions by Clause 17 to the extent of their repugnancy
and 1982 Executive Instructions cannot, therefore, be applicable to
the matters of recruitment and service conditions of ASCOs. Thus in
the absence of any rule framed under proviso to Article 309 of the
Constitution of India, the 1992 Office Memorandum is still holding
the field pertaining to the matters of recruitment and service
conditions of ASCOs.
Point Nos.2 and 4

                                   21
24.         The   submission   of    Mr.  A.K.Mishra,  learned  Senior
Advocate is that the select list prepared by OPSC is valid for one
year as per Clause 10.5 of the 1992 Office Memorandum, and no
direction can be issued to appoint the selectees from the list
prepared by OPSC on 27.05.1999. He submitted that Clause 10.5 of
the 1992 Office Memorandum provides that in case of initial
recruitment through competitive examination, the recommendation
of the Commission shall remain valid for a period of one year from
the date of its approval by the Government or till the next list is
prepared by the Commission, whichever is earlier.            He cited
decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Shankarsan Dash
Vrs. Union of India, (1991) 3 SCC 47, the State of Orissa and
another Vrs. Rajkishore Nanda and others, (2010) 6 Supreme
Court Cases 777 and Government of Orissa Vrs. Haraprasad
Das and others, AIR 1998 SC 375. The Constitution Bench in the
case of Shankarsan Dash (supra) held that appearance of the name
of a candidate in the select list does not give him a right for
appointment. In the case of Rajkishore Nanda(supra), the Supreme
Court held that a person whose name appears in the select list does
not acquire any indefeasible right of appointment. Empanelment at
the best is a condition of eligibility for the purpose of appointment
and by itself does not amount to select or create a vested right to be
appointed. The vacancies have to be filled up as per the statutory

                                      22
rules and in conformity with the constitutional mandate.               The
Supreme Court further held that a select list cannot be treated as a
reservoir for the purpose of appointments, that vacancy can be filled
up taking the names from that list as and when it is so required and
no relief can be granted to the candidate if he approaches the Court
after expiry of the select list. Further, if the selection process is
over, select list has expired and appointments had been made, no
relief can be granted by the court at a belated stage. In the case of
Haraprasad Das(supra), it is held that if the Government decides to
make further appointments for a valid reasons, it cannot be said
that it has acted arbitrarily by not appointing those whose names
are included in the select list. It is further held that whether to fill up
a post or not is a policy decision and unless it is shown to be
arbitrary, it is open to the Tribunal to interfere with such decision of
the Government and direct it to make further appointments.
25.           The instant case is required to be examined on the anvil
of the decisions cited supra. Immediately after preparation of select
list by the OPSC, opposite party no.4 approached the learned
Tribunal. As would be evident from the facts narrated in the
preceding paragraphs, several O.As. were filed at different points of
time and spate of orders were passed in the said original
applications. In view of pendency of several cases before the

                                  23
learned Tribunal at different points of time and spate of orders
passed by the learned Tribunal, no appointment could be made. In
the case of    State of Utter Pradesh Vrs. Ram Swarup Saroj,
(2000) 3 Supreme Court Cases 699, the U.P. Public Service
Commission, on a requisition made by the Allahabad High Court,
held an examination in the year 1990 for selecting suitable
candidates for appointment of Munsifs. The respondent, who
belongs to a Scheduled Caste, appeared in the written examination
and was declared having passed the same. He was also called for an
oral interview on 17.10.1994. The result of the selection was
declared on 25.11.1994. He had secured 432 out of 950 marks. The
last two candidates appearing in the list of successful candidates
belonging to the Scheduled Caste category were Shambhu Nath and
Rahul Kumar Katyal, who had secured 433/950 marks each. From
out of the list of successful candidates belonging to the Scheduled
Caste category, all excepting one Narendra Pratap Singh joined the
service. In the month of October 1997, the respondent filed a writ
petition before the Allahabad High Court seeking a direction to the
State of Uttar Pradesh to offer the vacancy created by non-joining of
Narendra Pratap Singh. The High Court of Allahabad held that it
would serve the interest of justice, if the respondents were directed
to fill in the vacancy available in the category of Scheduled Caste
candidates in the order of merit from out of the waiting list by

                                    24
appointing one who was willing to join the post. The said judgment
was challenged by the State of U.P. before the Supreme Court. In
paragraph-10 of the report, their Lordships held that select list was
finalized in the month of November 1996 and the writ petition was
filed by the respondent in the month of October 1997, i.e., before
expiry of one year from the date of the list. Their Lordships further
held that merely because period of one year had elapsed during the
pendency of litigation, the respondent could not be denied any relief
which he was entitled to. The ratio of the said decision applies with
full force to the facts and circumstances of the present case. On a
conspectus of Clause 10.5 of the 1992 Office Memorandum, it is
evident that the select list is valid for a period of one year from the
date of its approval by the Government or the next list is furnished
by the Commission, whichever is earlier. The said clause further
provides that in extraordinary circumstances, when for any reason,
appointments have not been completed and the list recommended
has not been exhausted, Government by special order, may extend
the validity period as necessary, but not later than the date of the
next recommendation of the Commission. If the said Clause is read
as whole, it is crystal clear that recommendation of Commission is
valid for a period of one year from the date of its approval by the
Government or the next list is furnished by the Commission
whichever is earlier, but then in extraordinary circumstances, when

                                  25
for any reason, appointments have not been completed and the list
so recommended by the Commission has not been exhausted, the
Government by special order may extend validity of the period, but
not later than the date of next recommendation of the Commission.
From the list prepared by the Commission, in view of the pendency
of several cases and spate of orders passed by the learned Tribunal
as well as this Court, no appointment could be made. Though the
selectees, have appeared at the interview and became successful,
have no indefeasible right to be appointed to the post of ASCOs,
merely because their names found place in the merit list, but in view
of the pendency of several cases none of the selectees from the
merit list was appointed. In the meantime, they have crossed the
upper age limit of 31 years prescribed in the 1992 Office
Memorandum and are in-eligible to appear at the interview. Thus,
we direct opposite party no.1, the State of Orissa, to extend the
validity period of select list in exercise of its power contained in
Clause 10.5 of the 1992 Office Memorandum.
Point No.3
26.         Mr. Manoj Mishra and Mr.B.Routray, learned Senior
Advocates submitted that since the applicant, opposite party no.4
has taken a calculated chance, appeared at the interview then, only
because result of interview is not palatable to him, he cannot turn

                                  26
round and subsequently contend that process of interview was
unfair or selection committee was not properly constituted. They
have cited decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Madan Lal
Vrs. Jammu and Kashmir, 1995 (3) SCC 486 and Dhananjay
Malik and others Vrs. State of Uttaranchal and others, (2008)
4 Supreme Court Cases 171. The said decisions are distinguishable
in the facts and circumstances of the present case. The applicant
before the Tribunal has not challenged the process of interview or
constitution of the selection committee. He has prayed, inter alia,
for a direction to the State of Orissa to fill up the post of ASCOs
according to the 1992 Office Memorandum by relaxing the number
of vacancies meant for direct recruits. A further direction was sought
that the State of Orissa cannot fill up 28 posts of ASCOs by way of
direct recruitment as per Annexure-3. We, therefore, concur with
the finding of the learned Tribunal that opposite party no.4 has
locus standi to file the case.
27.          Mr.A.K.Mishra, learned Senior Advocate submitted that
only nine posts could be filled up by way of direct recruitment. We
do not delve into that aspect of the matter. We, therefore, direct
opposite party nos.1 and 2 to calculate the vacancies and fill up
1/3rd of the same in accordance with the 1992 Office Memorandum.
Though Mr.Mishra argued that reservation can not exceed 50% of

                                     27
the total number of vacancies, since the said point had neither been
raised nor argued before the learned Tribunal nor it was answered,
it is not possible for this Court to decide the said issue.
28.          In view of the discussions made in the preceding
paragraphs, we affirm that part of the order dated 10.12.2001
passed by the learned Tribunal in O.A. No.3414 (C) of 1999 vide
Annexure-14, where it is held that the 1992 Office Memorandum is
an Executive Instruction and will hold the field, till a rule under the
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution is framed, but we are
unable to persuade ourselves with the view of the learned Tribunal
that the appointments should be given to direct recruits to the
extent of their quota only within one year from the date of receipt of
the order, after which, the list shall outlive its validity.       We,
therefore, direct the opposite party nos.1 and 2 to take a decision
within a period of two months with regard to the validity period of
the select list prepared by OPSC as provided under Clause 10.5 of
the 1992 Office Memorandum and appoint persons from the said list
in accordance with the said Office Memorandum.
29.          Before parting with the case, we would like to observe
that the aforesaid impasse has been created by opposite party nos.1
and 2 due to non-framing of rules under the proviso to Article 309 of
the Constitution of India and issuing Executive Instructions from

                                   28
time to time. Had earlier steps been taken at the behest of the
Government, the employees could not have approached the learned
Tribunal as well as this Court and precious time of the Court would
have been saved. We hope and trust that the Government would
take steps to frame a rule pertaining to service conditions of
employees of the Orissa Soil Conservation Service as early as
possible to avoid further complicacies and further litigations.
            With the aforesaid modification of the impugned order,
the writ application is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
                                          ……………………………….
                                           (Dr. A.K. Rath, J.)
M.M. Das, J.          I agree.
                                           ………………………………
                                              ( M.M. Das, J.)
