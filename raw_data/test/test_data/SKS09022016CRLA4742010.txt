                                                              -Mahatma Gandhi
                      The appellant Rintu @ Narottam Naik faced trial in

2.           The prosecution case as per the First Information
Report lodged by one Niranjan Nayak (P.W.3), the husband of
the victim on 08.02.2008 before the Inspector-in-charge, Barbil
Police Station is that on 06.02.2008 the victim, who is the wife
of the informant had been to Badasahi Basti and was returning
home at about 6.30 p.m. and while she was on the way, near a
railway crossing, all on a sudden eight persons lifted her gagging
her mouth and the victim could identify two of the culprits
namely, Benu Nayak and the appellant out of the eight culprits.
It is further stated in the First Information Report that the
culprits committed gang rape on the victim. After returning from
his work, the informant could not find the victim in the house

                                3
and accordingly he proceeded to the house of his elder sister but
there he got information that the victim had already left the
house. The informant could locate the victim at Patra Sahi in
Bolani Basti and found her crying. The victim narrated the
incident before the informant and she also fell ill for which there
was delay in giving information at the Police Station.
            The First Information Report which was lodged at
Bolani Out Post was sent to Barbil Police Station for registration
and accordingly Barbil P.S. Case No.30 dated 08.02.2008 was
registered under section 376(2)(g) of the Indian Penal Code.
The Inspector-in-Charge of Barbil Police Station directed P.W.11
Chitta Ranjan Nayak, who was the S.I. of Police attached to
Bolani outpost to take up investigation of the case.

Indian Penal Code against the appellant and showing co-accused
Benu @ Benudhar Nayak as an absconder.
3.           After submission of charge sheet, the case was
committed to the Court of Session after observing due committal
procedure where the learned Trial Court framed charge against
the appellant on 30.04.2009 under section 376 (2)(g) of the
Indian Penal Code and since the appellant refuted the charge,
pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried, the sessions trial
procedure was resorted to prosecute him and establish his guilt.

                                  5
4.           During course of trial, in order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as eleven witnesses.
             P.W.1 Kaibalya Mohanta was the constable attached

             P.W.3 Niranjan Nayak is the husband of the victim
and he is also the informant in the case. He stated that while he

             P.W.4 is the victim.
             P.W.5 Gopinath Munda is the scribe of the First

                                 6
            P.W.6 Kalu Munda did not support the prosecution
case.

            P.W.8 Smt. Amula Nayak did not support the

            P.W.9   Dr.   Aswini   Kumar    Dash    examined    the
appellant on 09.09.2008 at Government Hospital, Barbil and
opined that the appellant was well capable of committing sexual
intercourse. He collected the sample of semen, pubic hair and
blood of the appellant.
            P.W.10 Dr. Ratna Panda examined the victim on
9.2.2008 at Government Hospital, Barbil and she proved her
medical examination report Ext.7.
            P.W.11 Chitta Ranjan Nayak was the S.I. of police,
Bolani Outpost who is the Investigating Officer in the case.
            The   prosecution   exhibited   thirteen   numbers    of
documents. Exts.1, 2, 3 and 5 are the seizure lists, Ext.4 is the
First  Information   Report,   Ext.6  is  the    requisition -cum-

             The prosecution also proved three material objects.
M.O.I is the Orange colour polyester sari, M.O.II is the Earth
colour torn saya and M.O.III is the Nikkar Pant.
5.           The defence plea of the appellant was one of denial.
6.           Mr. Chita Ranjan Sahu, learned counsel appearing
for the appellant contended that the impugned judgment and
order of conviction is not sustainable in the eye of law and there
is delay of two days in lodging the First Information Report and
the victim’s statement is contradictory and since the victim was
pregnant at the time of alleged occurrence and gang rape was
alleged to have been committed on her, since there was no
abortion, the theory of gang rape is falsified. Learned counsel for
the appellant further urged that chemical examination report do
not support the prosecution case. The learned counsel further
submitted that the sentence imposed by the learned Trial Court
is excessive and as the petitioner is in jail custody since
10.9.2008, in case the order of conviction is sustained, the
sentence be reduced to period already undergone.
             Mr. Jyoti Prakash Patra, learned Addl. Standing
Counsel on the other hand contended that in a case of this
nature, if the evidence of the victim is found to be clear, cogent

                                  8
and trustworthy, that itself is sufficient to convict the appellant.
He urged that the victim has categorically implicated the
appellant and two others to have committed rape on her and
other persons have participated in dragging her and also
committing same other overt acts.          Learned counsel for the
State   further    urged   that  the    medical   evidence   clearly
corroborates the evidence of the victim and the seizure of torn
wearing apparels of the victim is an additional factor which lends
support   to   her   statement.     The   learned  counsel  further
submitted that merely because as per the chemical examination
report, blood stain or semen stain could not be detected on the
wearing apparels of the victim that would not be a factor to
reject the testimony of the victim. The learned counsel further
submitted that the sentence which was imposed by the learned
trial Court is the minimum sentence for the offence of gang rape
and there being no adequate and special reason to reduce the
sentence, the appeal should be dismissed.
7.           Considering the rival contentions raised at the Bar
and adverting to the evidence of the victim (P.W.4) who is the
star witness of the prosecution, it is found that she has stated
that on the date of occurrence while she was coming from Bolani
Basti to her house by crossing the railway bridge, at that time,
four persons arrived before her near railway bridge on her front

                                 9
as well as on the back and they forcibly caught hold her by
giving a slap on her face and then they lifted her to a place at a
little distance. She has further stated that the culprits removed
her sari, saya and blouse and made her full naked and then the
1st accused namely Benu Naik forcibly raped her under a tree
and then the appellant raped her and then another boy also
forcibly raped her whose name she did not know. Then the
victim lost her sense for which the culprits left the spot. The
victim has stated that after the occurrence, when she regained
her sense, she found herself in a full naked condition and at that
time her husband P.W.3 along with Binod Naik arrived there and
when her husband found her naked, he covered her body with a
Chadar. The victim further stated that it is the ward member
who scribed the F.I.R. which was presented at Bolani Out Post.
The victim in the cross examination has specifically stated that
except the appellant and Benu Naik, he did not know the name
of other accused persons for which she could not be able to
identify them. She has further stated that she had disclosed the
name of the appellant as culprit before the Police and further
stated that the appellant was no way related to her. Nothing
substantial has been elicited in the cross examination of the
victim to discard her version.

                                 10
             At this stage, coming to the evidence of the doctor
P.W.10, it is found that she examined the victim on 9.2.2008 at
Government Hospital, Barbil and noticed that there were
multiple partially healed abrasions all over her body, especially
on buttocks, lower thighs, hands, arms and legs suggestive of
friction on the rough surface and the age of the abrasions were
within 2 to 5 days. The doctor further opined that the victim was
16 to 18 weeks pregnant at the time of her examination and she
found there were old hymeneal tears present. She further stated
that the symptom suggested that the victim was exposed to
sexual intercourse previously. The doctor collected vaginal
smear, vaginal swab, pubic hair, blood sample and handed it
over to the constable and she proved her medical examination
report Ext.7. The doctor has stated in the cross-examination
that in case of forcible rape on a married lady, there is less
possibility of happening of the injuries on private organ of the
victim. Thus the evidence of the victim that she was subjected
to gang rape is corroborated by the medical evidence.
             The victim has also disclosed about the incident
before her husband P.W.3 and accordingly the name of the
appellant finds place in the First Information Report which was
lodged on 08.02.2008 at Bolani Outpost.

                                11
8.          The contentions of the learned counsel for the
appellant that there was two days delay in lodging the First
Information Report for which the prosecution case should not be
believed, is not acceptable. In a case of rape, the delay in
lodging the First Information Report is not a factor to disbelieve
the prosecution case. The victim of rape and their family
members are ordinarily reluctant to approach the police because
of family prestige and after making up their mind to fight for the
cause of justice, ultimately they decide to take recourse of the
law and in the present case when the occurrence has taken
place on 6.2.2008 in the evening hours and the FIR was lodged
on 8.2.2008, it cannot be said that there was such an inordinate
delay which would be sufficient to create doubt about the
prosecution case.
            The contention of the learned counsel for the
appellant that the victim was pregnant for 16-18 weeks at the
time of occurrence and in that case, had she been subjected to
gang rape, there would have been abortion is an hypothetical
argument because to that effect nothing has been put to the
doctor who examined the victim.
            There    are   some  minor   contradictions    in  the
statement   of   the  victim  made   during  trial  vis-a-vis  her
statement made before police inasmuch as the victim has not

                                   12
stated before police that the sexual intercourse was committed
on her under a Tanta tree and that after commission of rape,
she had sat under the Tanta tree but in my humble view, these
contradictions are very insignificant and do not affect the
credibility of the rape victim in any manner.
             So far    as   the  chemical  examination   report is
concerned, it appears that the saree, torn saya, blood sample,
pubic hair, vaginal swab of the victim as well as half pant, blood
sample, pubic hair and semen of the accused were sent for
chemical examination. The report indicates that blood and
semen stains could not be detected in the wearing apparels of
the victim as well as on the half pant of the appellant. However
sample blood of the victim as well as the appellant was found to
be Group ‘A’. Even though the blood and semen stain could not
be detected on the wearing apparels of the victim, it is not a
ground to reject the prosecution case inasmuch as it is the
prosecution case that the victim was raped while she was in a
complete naked position and she sat under a tree in that
position after the occurrence and thereafter her husband gave
her a bed sheet. Therefore, as at the time of forcible sexual
intercourse, the victim was not wearing any saree and saya, the
non-finding of the semen stain or blood stain on her wearing
apparels is not a factor to disbelieve the prosecution case.

                                  13
             Similarly, non-finding of the blood or semen stain on
the half pant of the appellant is not a factor to disbelieve that
the appellant has participated in the crime. P.W.9, the doctor
who examined the appellant on 09.09.2008 has specifically
stated that the appellant is well capable of committing sexual
intercourse. Thus the evidence of the victim is not only clear,
clinching, trustworthy, reliable and above board but the same
also gets corroboration from the medical evidence. The seizure
of torn saya is an additional factor which lends support to her
testimony. The disclosure made by the victim immediately after
the occurrence before her husband is admissible as res gestae
under section 6 of the Evidence Act.
             Therefore, I do not find any infirmity or illegality in
the impugned judgment and order of conviction of the learned
Trial Court and accordingly, I am of the view that the learned
Trial Court has rightly found the appellant guilty under section
376 (2)(g) of IPC.
9.           So far as sentence is concerned, the appellant is in
custody since 10.09.2008 and he had undergone about seven
and half years of imprisonment inasmuch as throughout during
trial as well as during pendency of the appeal, the appellant was
not released on bail.

                                 14
              Section  376(2)(g)   of  the  Indian   Penal  Code
prescribes minimum punishment for ten years which may extend
to life and shall also be liable to fine. However, it is provided
that the Court may for adequate and special reasons can impose
a sentence of imprisonment of either description for a term of
less than ten years. Therefore, in a case of gang rape, unless
there are any adequate or special reasons, the Court is not
empowered to impose any sentence lesser than the minimum as
prescribed under the statute.
              In the present case, nothing has been brought on
record and nothing has also been submitted by the learned
counsel for the appellant to wake out any adequate or special
reasons to reduce the sentence of imprisonment and since
minimum sentence has been imposed, I also find there is no
infirmity in the same.
             By passing a lenient sentence in a serious offence
like gang rape, the punishment would lose its deterrent effect.
Passing of appropriate sentence is always in the interest of
society. The conduct of the appellant and the defenceless and
unprotected state at the victim cannot be lost sight of while
awarding sentence in an appropriate manner.
             Therefore, I am of the view that the impugned
judgment and order of conviction of the appellant under section

                                     15
376(2)(g) of the Indian Penal Code and sentence of rigorous
imprisonment for ten years with payment of fine of Rs.5,000/-,
in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five months as
was imposed by the learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment
and order dated 24.08.2009 is legal, proper and justified.
                  Accordingly, the criminal appeal being devoid of
merits, stands dismissed.
                                                  ...…………………………
