Date of hearing & Judgement:                     28/08/2015
                       JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
1.     Heard Mr. M.A. Sheikh, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also
heard Mr. S. C. Keyal, learned ASGI representing the Union of India. I
have also heard Mr. B.J. Ghosh, learned State counsel. I have also
perused the entire materials on record including the LCR received from
the Tribunal.
2.     This writ petition is directed against the order dated 24/05/2012
passed by the learned Member, Foreigners Tribunal-1, Dhubri, Assam in
FT Case No. 1194/G/09 (Reference Case No. R/IMDT/5106/98) (State
of Assam Vs. Md. Haran Ali). By the said judgement and order, the
petitioner has been declared to be foreigner of post 25/03/1971.
3.     In the Tribunal, opposing the reference, the petitioner in his
written statement filed on 16/05/2012, inter alia, contended that he
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                        Page 2 of 11

was a student of 1339 No. Dangirchar LP School up to the year 1985
and as per the Admission Register, his date of birth is 20/03/1974.
Supporting the said contention, the petitioner annexed the School
Certificate as Annexure-B. The certificate is dated 02/12/1985 with the
name of the Head Master as Shri Gauri Sankar Sarkar. As per the said
certificate, the petitioner was a student of the School and he completed
his studies on 31/12/1985. He appeared in Class-II examination and that
his date of birth is 20/03/1974. The letter ‘7’ is by way of insertion over
the original letter.
4.     Be that as it may, from the records it appears that the Tribunal
having doubt on the said school certificate ordered for an enquiry by the
Superintendent of Police, Dhubri. The copy of the enquiry report is
available in the LCR. As per the said report dated 28/06/2012 of the
Superintendent of Police (B), Dhubri, the school certificate is the
product of forgery, inasmuch as, Shri Gauri Sankar Sarkar was not the
Head Master of the school in whose name the certificate was shown
issued in 1985. He had joined the school on 16/11/1999. Along with the
said report, another enquiry report of the S.I.(B), Lutfor Rahman was
also enclosed. For a ready reference, the report of the Superintendent
of Police (B), Dhubri addressed to the learned Member, Foreigners
Tribunal-I, Dhubri, vide letter dated 21/01/2012, is reproduced below :-

       Ref : Order dated 24-05-2012 in connection with FT Case No.
               1194/G/09.
               With reference to the subject cited above, I have the
       honour to state that, as ordered, the matter of genuineness of
       the certificate issued to Haran Ali was locally enquired by
       S.I.(B) Lutfor Rahman, I/C, Dhubri PPCP (ICP) and found that no
       such student namely Haran Ali, S/O Araj Ali, of Village-
       Falimari, P.S. & Dist.- Dhubri (Assam) got admitted into 1339
       No. Dangirchar L.P. School from the year 1979 to 1983 as per
       Admission Register. The counter foil of the Certificate Books
       were also verified but no such certificate is found issued
       against Haran ali by Shri Gauri Sankar Sarkar, Head Master,
       1339 No. Dangirchar L.P. School. As per the statement of Sri
       Gauri Sankar Sarkar, he was appointed as an Assistant
       Teacher in 940 No. Besharkona L.P. School in 1989 and joined
       there on 01-10-1989 an again he was transferred and posted
       to 1339 No. Dangirchar L.P. School as In-charge Head Master,
       where he joined on 16-11-1999 from 2142 No. Chaudhurir Char
       L.P. School. He never issued any such School Leaving
       certificate to Haran Ali though the signature put in the
       certificate is similar to his own signature. Some body might
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                      Page 4 of 11

       have forged his signature and issue the certificate without his
       knowledge. Copy of enquiry report submitted by S.I.(B) Lutfor
       Rahman and connected documents are enclosed herewith for
       favour of your ready reference.
              This is submitted for favour of your kind information
       and necessary action.
       Enclo : As stated above.
                                                         Yours faithfully,

                                                                   DHUBRI”
5.     Apart from the enclosed report of the SI(B), clearly depicting
forgery on the part of the petitioner in obtaining the school certificate,
the school documents were also enclosed. On perusal of the said records,
what is further revealed is that in the Admission Register, the name of
one Haran Ali Sekh (resembling the petitioner’s name), son of Elahi
Sekh appears, but on the other hand, the name of the petitioner’s
father is Araj Ali @ Harej Ali. The petitioner also named him as Haran
Ali @ Haran Ali Sekh. Apart from the admission Register, the statement
of Gauri Sankar Sarkar is also available who in his statement stated that
the certificate was never issued by him.
6.     Above apart, as has been discussed in the impugned judgement, if
the year of birth of the petitioner is taken as 1969 (as claimed by him),
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                      Page 5 of 11

his projected father’s name should have been there in the voter’s lists
prior to 1997 but surprisingly, the petitioner could not produce any
voters’ list containing the name of his father prior to 1977.
7.     Ext. 7 is the linkage certificate on which the petitioner placed
reliance. On perusal of the said document, it is found that the name of
Harej is over-written. Originally, there was another name. This aspect of
the matter has been discussed by the learned Tribunal. The certificate is
also not countersigned by any competent authority. The petitioner also
could not lead any reliable and cogent evidence to show that Md. Moslim
and Royman Nessa, whose names appeared in the voters’ list of 1965
and 1970 were the great grandparents of the petitioner.             Likewise,
there is also no cogent and reliable evidence that Ainuddin and Saleha
Khatun, the projected grandparents and whose name appeared in the
voters’ list of 1975 and 1970 were in fact grandparents of the petitioner.
Ext. 6, the forged school certificate, the date of birth of the petitioner
was shown as 20/03/1974 but in the voters’ list of 1989 (Ext. 4) his age
is shown as 20 years, meaning thereby he was born in 1969 and not in
1974.
8.     All the above aspects of the matter have been vividly discussed by
the learned Tribunal in the impugned judgement. For a ready reference,
para 5 of the impugned judgement, which is divided into parts and is
reproduced below :-
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                        Page 6 of 11

              “8.
              (i)     On careful perusal of the evidence of the OP, it
                      appears that the case projected by the OP is that
                      he is a citizen of India by birth and that the
                      names       of   his   great   grandparents     and
                      grandparents were recorded in the voters’ lists of
                      1965 and 1970 of Sorukhetri LAC in the district of
                      Kamrup and that the name of his father Araj Ali is
                      recorded in the voters’ list of 1977 of Chhaygaon
                      LAC in the district of Kamrup. The extract copy of
                      the voters’ list of 1977 (Ex.3) shows clearly the
                      age of Araaj Ali (the father of the OP) as 40 years.
                      If that be so, the father of the OP should have
                      been born in the year 1937 and as such he should
                      have been at least of the age of 23 years in the
                      year 1960. Further, in the voters’ list of 1989,
                      the age of the OP is shown as 20 years. If that be
                      so, his father should have been an adult person at
                      the time of the birth of the OP i.e. in 1969 and his
                      name should have appeared in any of the voters’
                      lists prior to 1977.
              (ii)    But surprisingly, the OP did not produce any
                      document to prove that his father’s name was
                      registered as a voter in any of the voters’ lists
                      prior to 1977. In the linkage certificate (Ex.7)
                      relied upon by the OP, the name of his father
                      appears to be overwritten. It appears that the
                      name Harez Ali is made Arez Ali by making some
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                       Page 7 of 11

                      overwriting.    The    said    certificate      is not
                      countersigned by any competent authority.
              (iii)   There is absolutely no cogent and reliable
                      evidence to show that Md. Moslim and Royman
                      Nessa, whose name appear in the voters’ list of
                      1965 and 1970 of Sorukhetri LAC, were the great
                      grandparents of the OP. Likewise there is no
                      cogent and reliable       evidence to show that
                      Ainuddin and Sahela Khatun, whose names also
                      appear in the voters’ list of 1965 and 1970 of
                      Sorukhetri LAC, were the grandparents of the OP.
                      Again one more interesting fact is found in the
                      school certificate (Ex.6) relied upon by the O.P.
              (iv)    In Ex.6, the date of birth of the OP is shown as
                      20.03.1974 but in the voters’ list of 1989 (Ex-4)
                      his age is shown as 20 years which shows that he
                      should have been born in 1969 and not in 1974.
                      Therefore if the age of the OP (date of birth)
                      shown in the school certificate is accepted as
                      correct then his age shown in the voters’ list of
                      1989 is incorrect.
              (v)     Again in the school certificate (Ex. 6) it is stated
                      that he completed his primary education in the
                      Dangirchar LP School on 31.12.1985 whereas in
                      the same certificate the date of issue of the
                      certificate is given as 02.12.1985 i.e. the date
                      priot to the date of his completion of education
                      and is certified. As such, both the linkage
                      certificate (Ex.7) and the school certificate (Ex. 6)
                      are found to be not at all reliable documents. No
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                        Page 8 of 11

                      reliance can be placed on them. In the voters’ list
                      of 1989 (Ex.4), the age of the OP is shown as 20
                      years whereas after eight years in the voters’ list
                      of 1997 his age is shown as 23 years only. The OP
                      has stated in his written statement that as per
                      school certificate his date of birth is 20.03.1974
                      and he read in the school up to 1985 only when he
                      was only about 11 (eleven) years of age (as per
                      school certificate). Then, the question arises as
                      to how in the year 1989 his age was shown in the
                      voters list as 20 years, when as per his school
                      certificate he should have been only 15 years of
                      age in 1989.
              (vi)    The OP has also stated in the written statement
                      that the names of his parents were not recorded
                      in the voters’ list of 1966 due to underage but
                      this statement is belied by the voters’ list of 1977
                      (relied upon by the OP) where the age of his
                      father is shown as 40 years and which shows that
                      he (father of the OP) was about 29 years of age in
                      the year 1966 and was not under aged for
                      recording his name as a voter.”
9.     As has been held by the Apex Court in L.I.C. of India and Anr. Vs.
Ram Pal Singh Bisen reported in 2010 (4) SCC 491, mere production of
some documents or exhibiting the same without proving the contents
thereof is not enough. In this connection, para 31 of the judgement is
quoted below :-
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                      Page 9 of 11

              “31. Under the Law of Evidence also, it is necessary
              that contents of documents are required to be proved
              either by primary or by secondary evidence. At the most,
              admission of documents may amount to admission of
              contents but not its truth. Documents having not been
              produced and marked as required under the Evidence
              Act cannot be relied upon by the Curt. Contents of the
              document cannot be proved by merely filing in a court.”
10.    Above apart, the petitioner having taken recourse to falsehood by
producing false and forged documents, itself establishes that he is not an
Indian citizen.
11.    For all the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any merit in the writ
petition and accordingly, it is dismissed. Consequent upon dismissal of
the writ petition, now the Superintendent of Police (B), Dhubri shall
ensure that the petitioner is arrested and detained in the detention
camp till his deportation to her country of origin i.e. Bangladesh. The
Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri shall ensure deletion of the name of the
petitioner from the voter list, if any.
12.    Independent of the above, the Superintendent of Police, Dhubri
may also launch criminal proceeding against the petitioner for taking
recourse to forgery, which finds mention in his above quoted report.
13.    Let the matter be listed again after one month so as to submit
report by the Superintendent of Police (B) Dhubri about the action taken
in the terms of this order.
WP(C) 3381/15 oral dated 28/08/15                      Page 10 of 11

14.    Registry shall send down the case records to the learned court
below along with a copy of this judgement and order. A copy of the
judgement and order may also be furnished to Mr. B.J. Ghosh, learned
State Counsel as well as Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned ASGI, for their
immediate necessary follow up action. Copies shall also be sent to the
SP(B), Dhubri and Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri, for their immediate
follow up action.
