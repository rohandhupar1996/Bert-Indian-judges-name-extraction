S. K. SAHOO, J.           The appellant/petitioner Saroj Kumar Misra who was
        the Executive Engineer, NH Division, Berhampur during the year
        2002 to 2004 and then posted as Superintending Engineer, Rural
        Works, Bhubaneswar at the time of filing of the appeal and has
        retired on suspension in the meantime, has filed this misc. case
        under section 389 of Cr.P.C. for suspension of his conviction
        passed by the learned Special Judge (Vigilance), Phulbani in G.R.

                                2
Case No. 08 of 2013 (v) (T.R. No.08 of 2013) vide impugned
judgment and order dated 13.12.2016 in convicting him under
section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 (hereafter ‘1988 Act’) and sentencing him
to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a
fine of Rs.2,000/- (rupees two thousand), in default, to undergo
further R.I. for one month.
2.           The petitioner Saroj Kumar Mishra along with co-
accused Sudarsan Sahani, Prasanta Kumar Patra and Abakash
Padhy were charged under section 13(2) read with section
13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act along with offences punishable under
sections 420, 468, 201 and section 120-B of the Indian Penal
Code on the accusation of misappropriating government money
to the tune of Rs.1,50,000/- (one lakh fifty thousand) in
connivance with each other.
             The learned trial Court acquitted the co-accused
Abakash Padhy of all the charges. The petitioner Saroj Kumar
Mishra and the other two co-accused persons namely Sudarsan
Sahani and Prasanta Kumar Patra were also acquitted of the
charges under sections 420, 468, 201 and 120-B of the Indian
Penal Code but they were found guilty under section 13(2) read
with section 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act.

                                3
3.          The prosecution case, in short, is that pursuant to an
allegation  of   misappropriation    of  government    money    of
Rs.1,50,000/- by showing false execution of pot-hole repair work
in NH 217 from 147 K.M. to 171 K.M. in the year 2004, an
enquiry was taken up, in course of which it was ascertained that
during the period 2002 to 2004, Sudarsan Sahani was the S.D.O.
of NH Sub-division, Balliguda, petitioner Saroj Kumar Mishra was
the Executive Engineer, NH Division, Berhampur and co-accused
Prasanta Kumar Patra was the Junior Engineer of NH Section,
Balliguda. During the said period, an estimate was made relating
to periodical renewal of NH 217 and the same was sanctioned
and agreement was executed on 19.02.2004 with contractor Sri
Arun Kumar Choudhury relating to P.R. Coat of NH 217 from 148
KM to 154 KM for an amount of Rs.36,98,199/- with date of
commencement and completion from 19.02.2004 to 18.06.2004
and further time extension was given upto 30.01.2005. The
enquiry further revealed that while the said agreement was
subsisting, another agreement was executed for the same
portion of work with co-accused Abakash Padhy overlapping the
earlier agreement with an estimate of Rs.4,64,881/- with the
date of commencement and completion from 10.09.2004 to
09.03.2005. After execution of agreement with co-accused

                                  4
Abakash     Padhy,   co-accused    Prasanta   Kumar   Patra  made
necessary entries relating to pot-hole repair work in the
measurement book and an amount of Rs.1,50,000/- was paid to
co-accused Abakash Padhy on 14.10.2004. It further came to
light that pot-hole repair works from 147 KM to 171 KM was not
actually executed and false bills were prepared and payment of
Rs.1,50,000/- was shown. The Superintending Engineer, NH
Circle (South), Bhubaneswar conducted an inspection and came
to the conclusion that the agreement drawn by the Executive
Engineer, NH, Division, Berhampur was unauthorized as another
agreement over the same patch was already in force and it was
further found that inflated rates were given to the Contractor in
order to give undue financial benefit for executing pot-hole repair
works and that the measurement books were not produced
before him for his scrutiny.
4.           The learned trial Court in his impugned judgment has
been pleased to hold that the prosecution has failed to bring
home the offences under sections 420 and 468 of the Indian
Penal Code in as much as since final bill had not been prepared,
payment of Rs.1,50,000/- to co-accused Abakash Padhi in an
inflated rate cannot be accepted.

                                  5
            The learned trial Court further held that on careful
scrutiny of the material, there appears nothing to the fact that
the petitioner conspired along with the other co-accused persons
to grab the government funds allotted for construction of pot-
holes and therefore, the prosecution has failed to bring home the
charge under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code against the
accused persons.
            The   learned   trial  Court  further  held  that the
disappearance of MB No.1311 against the petitioner and co-
accused persons Sudarsan Sahani and Prasant Kumar Patra was
not founded and accordingly, the prosecution has failed to
substantiate the charge under section 201 of the Indian Penal
Code against the accused persons.
            However, the learned trial Court held that the
prosecution has successfully established the offence under
section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act against
the petitioner, co-accused Sudarsan Sahani and Prasanta Kumar
Patra and accordingly found them guilty.
5.          Mr.   Asok    Mohanty,    learned    Senior  Advocate
appearing for the petitioner strenuously contended that after
acquitting the petitioner of the charges under sections 420, 468,

                                  6
201 and section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, the learned trial
Court has illegally convicted the petitioner under section 13(2)
read with section 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act holding in paragraph-
17 of the impugned judgment that on 10.09.2004 the petitioner
had entered into an agreement with co-accused Abakash Padhy
vide Agreement No.1F2/04-05 for the self-same work with
commencement         and   completion    date  as  10.09.2004    to
09.03.2005 and as such, the subsequent contract i.e. 1F2/04-05
entered into in between the petitioner and Abakash Padhy was
illegal. It is contended that the first agreement was in respect of
a work having a different patch of the road and for a larger
amount whereas the second agreement was for the repair work
of pot hole after the rainy season and flood for an amount below
rupees five lakhs. It is further contended that as the first
contractor did not execute the work which was necessary due to
damage of the road on account of rainy season followed by
heavy flood and abandoned the work, show cause notice was
issued to him and keeping in view the urgency and requirement
of repair for convenience of public, second agreement was
executed by way of tender. It is further contended that time
stipulated in the first contract had already elapsed and therefore,
there was nothing wrong in executing the second agreement and

                                  7
as such there was no culpability on the part of the petitioner
under Penal provisions of 1988 Act. It is further contended that
when co-accused Abakash Padhy has been acquitted of all the
charges, the learned trial Court should not have jumped to the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully established the
offence under section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act
against the petitioner. It is further contended that in absence of
any reasoning/findings as to why the petitioner is found guilty
under section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act
after being acquitted of the offences under Indian Penal Code,
the impugned judgment and order of conviction against the
petitioner is perverse and suffers from non-application of mind
and therefore, cannot be sustained in the eye of law. It is further
contended that since on the face of the impugned judgment, the
petitioner has a very good case for acquittal and the appeal
being of the year 2016 is not likely to be taken up for hearing in
the near future, unless the conviction is stayed/suspended, the
petitioner would suffer irreparable loss and injury and his service
will be at stake. It is further contended that co-accused
Sudarsan Sahani who was the S.D.O of NH Sub-Division has filed
a separate Criminal Appeal bearing CRLA No.695 of 2016 and he
filed a Misc. Case bearing Misc. Case No.152 of 2017 for

                                  8
suspension of his conviction which was allowed by this Court vide
order dated 15.09.2017.
6.           Mr. Srimanta Das, learned Senior Standing Counsel
for the Vigilance Department appearing for the opposite party
vehemently opposed the prayer for stay of conviction and also
filed his objection to such petition. It is contended that the
learned trial Court after going though the evidence on record has
rightly found the petitioner guilty and since stay of conviction
should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and in
rare cases where failure to stay conviction would lead to injustice
and irreversible consequences, nothing having been pointed out
by the learned counsel for the petitioner in that respect, no
favourable order should be passed in his favour. It is further
contended that delay in disposal of the appeal and the
submission that there are good arguable points by itself are not
sufficient to grant suspension of conviction. The learned counsel
further   contended    that  laxity in  corruption  cases    would
encourage corruption and therefore, the misc. case should be
dismissed. Learned Senior Standing Counsel for the Vigilance
Department placed the paragraph 16 and 17 of the impugned
Judgement. He placed reliance in the case of K.C. Sareen -Vrs.-

7.           In    the  case  of   K.C.  Sareen    -Vrs.-   C.B.I.,
Chandigarh reported in A.I.R. 2001 Supreme Court 3320,
it is held as follows:-
              “10. The legal position, therefore, is this:
             Though the power to suspend an order of
             conviction, apart from the order of sentence, is
             not alien to Section 389(1) of the Code, its
             exercise should be limited to very exceptional
             cases. Merely because the convicted person files
             an appeal in challenge of the conviction, the
             Court should not suspend the operation of the
             order of conviction. The Court has a duty to look
             at all aspects including the ramifications of
             keeping such conviction in abeyance. It is in the

                     10
light of the above legal position that, we have to
examine the question as to what should be the
position when a public servant is convicted of an
offence under the PC Act. No doubt when the
appellate Court admits the appeal filed in
challenge of the conviction and sentence for the
offence under the PC Act, the superior Court
should normally suspend the sentence of
imprisonment until disposal of the appeal,
because refusal thereof would render the very
appeal otiose unless such appeal could be heard
soon after the filing of the appeal. But
suspension of conviction of the offence under
the PC Act, dehors the sentence of imprisonment
as a sequel thereto, is different matter.
11. Corruption by public servants has now
reached a monstrous dimension in India. Its
tentacles have started grappling even the
institutions created for the protection of the
republic. Unless those tentacles are intercepted
and impeded from gripping the normal and
orderly functions of the public offices through
strong legislative, executive as well as judicial
exercises the corrupt public servants could even
paralyse the functioning of such institutions and
thereby     hinder    the     democratic    policy.
Proliferation of corrupt public servants could
garner momentum to cripple the social order if
such men are allowed to continue to manage
and operate public institutions. When a public
servant was found guilty of corruption after a
judicial adjudicatory process conducted by a
Court of law, judiciousness demands that he
should be treated as corrupt until he is
exonerated by a superior Court. The mere fact
that an appellate Court or revisional forum has
decided to entertain his challenge and to go into
the issues and findings made against such public

                      11
servants once again should not even temporarily
absolve him from such findings. If such a public
servant becomes entitled to hold public office
and to continue to do official acts until he is
judicially absolved from such findings by reason
of suspension of the order of conviction, it is
public interest which suffers and sometimes
even irreparably. When a public servant who is
convicted of corruption is allowed to continue to
hold public office, it would impair the morale of
the other persons manning such office, and
consequently that would erode the already
shrunk confidence of the people in such public
institutions besides demoralising the other
honest public servants who would either be the
colleagues or subordinates of the convicted
person. If honest public servants are compelled
to take orders from proclaimed corrupt officers
on account of the suspension of the conviction,
the fall out would be one of shaking the system
itself. Hence, it is necessary that the Court
should not aid the public servant who stands
convicted for corruption charges to hold only
public office until he is exonerated after
conducting a judicial adjudication at the
appellate or revisional level. It is a different
matter if a corrupt public officer could continue
to hold such public office even without the help
of a Court order suspending the conviction.
12. The above policy can be acknowledged as
necessary for the efficacy and proper functioning
of public offices. If so, the legal position can be
laid down that when conviction is on a
corruption charge against a public servant, the
appellate Court or the revisional Court should
not suspend the order of conviction during the
pendency of the appeal even if the sentence of
imprisonment of suspended. It would be a

                                  12
             sublime public policy that the convicted public
             servant is kept under disability of the conviction
             in spite of keeping the sentence of imprisonment
             in abeyance till the disposal of the appeal or
             revision.”
             In the case of State        of Maharashtra       -Vrs.-
Gajanan reported in A.I.R. 2004 Supreme Court 1188, it is
held as follows:-
             “5. In the said judgment of K.C. Sareen (supra),
             this Court has held that it is only in very
             exceptional cases that the court should exercise
             such power of stay in matters arising out of the
             Act. The High Court has in the impugned order
             nowhere pointed out what is the exceptional fact
             which in its opinion required it to stay the
             conviction. The High Court also failed to note the
             direction of this Court that it has a duty to look
             at all aspects including ramification of keeping
             such conviction in abeyance. The High Court, in
             our opinion, has not taken into consideration any
             of the above factors while slaying the conviction.
             It should also be noted that the view expressed
             by this Court in K.C. Sareen's case (supra) was
             subsequently     approved     followed   by    the
             judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Atar
             Singh and Anr. (2003) 12 SCC 434.”
             In the case of State of Punjab -Vrs.- Deepak
Mattu reported in A.I.R. 2008 Supreme Court 35, it is held
as follows:-
             “6. An order of suspension of conviction
             admittedly is not to be readily granted. The High
             Court in its order dated 11.1.2005 passed a

                                 13
           judgment       irrespective  of  conviction    and
           sentence, only on two grounds;
           (i) A long time may be taken to decide the appeal.
           (ii) There are good points to argue.
           7. While passing the said Order, the High Court
           did not assign any special reasons. Possible
           delay in disposal of the appeal and there are
           arguable points by itself may not be sufficient to
           grant suspension of a sentence. The High Court
           while passing the said Order merely noticed
           some points which could be raised in the appeal.
           The grounds so taken do not suggest that the
           Respondent was proceeded against by the State,
           mala fide or any bad faith….”
           In the case State of Punjab -Vrs.- Navraj Singh
reported in AIR 2008 Supreme Court 2962, it is held as
follows:-
           “12. It is to be noted that learned Single Judge
           while     directing   suspension   of    conviction
           indicated no reasons.
           13. Above being the position, the order of the
           learned       Single     Judge,   directing     the
           suspension/stay of the conviction as well as the
           order refusing to recall the said order cannot
           stand and are set aside.”
           In the case of C.B.I. -Vrs.- M.N. Sharma reported
in A.I.R. 2009 Supreme Court 1185, it is held as follows:-
            “10. It is to be noted that learned Single Judge
           while     directing   suspension   of    conviction
           indicated no reasons.

                                 14
             11. Above being the position the order of the
             learned     Single     Judge,      directing   the
             suspension/stay of the conviction cannot stand
             and is set aside.”
             In the case of State of Maharastra through CBI -
Vrs.- Balakrishna reported in 2012 (12) SCC 384, it is held
as follows:-
             “12. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, a
             clear picture emerges to the effect that, the
             Appellate Court in an exceptional case, may put
             the conviction in abeyance along with the
             sentence, but such power must be exercised
             with great circumspection and caution, for the
             purpose of which, the applicant must satisfy the
             Court as regards the evil that is likely to befall
             him, if the said conviction is not suspended. The
             Court has to consider all the facts as are pleaded
             by the applicant, in a judicious manner and
             examined whether the facts and circumstances
             involved in the case are such, that they warrant
             such a course of action by it. The Court
             additionally, must record in writing, its reasons
             for granting such relief. Relief of staying the
             order of conviction cannot be granted only on
             the ground that an employee may lose his job, if
             the same is not done.”
             In the case of Shyam Narain Pandey -Vrs.- State
of U.P. reported in 2015 Criminal Law Journal 250, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-
             “7. 'Convict' means declared to be guilty of
             criminal offence by the verdict of Court of law.
             That declaration is made after the Court finds

                    15
him guilty of the charges      which have been
proved against him. Thus, in   effect, if one prays
for stay of conviction, he is  asking for stay of
operation of the effects of    the declaration of
being guilty.
8. It has been consistently held by this Court
that unless there are exceptional circumstances,
the appellate Court shall not stay the conviction,
though the sentence may be suspended. There
is no hard and fast rule or guidelines as to what
are those exceptional circumstances. However,
there are certain indications in the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 itself as to which are
those situations and a few indications are
available in the judgments of this Court as to
what are those circumstances.
9. It may be noticed that even for the
suspension of the sentence, the Court has to
record the reasons in writing under Section
389(1) Code of Criminal Procedure. Couple of
provisos were added under Section 389(1) Code
of   Criminal    Procedure    pursuant     to   the
recommendations made by the Law Commission
of India and observations of this Court in various
judgments, as per Act 25 of 2005. It was
regarding the release on bail of a convict where
the sentence is of death or life imprisonment or
of a period not less than ten years. If the
appellate Court is inclined to consider release of
a convict of such offences, the Public Prosecutor
has to be given an opportunity for showing
cause in writing against such release. This is
also an indication as to the seriousness of such
offences and circumspection which the Court
should have while passing the order on stay of
conviction. Similar is the case with offences
involving moral turpitude. If the convict is

                                   16
             involved in crimes which are so outrageous and
             yet beyond suspension of sentence, if the
             conviction also is stayed, it would have serious
             impact on the public perception on the integrity
             institution. Such orders definitely will shake the
             public confidence in judiciary. That is why, it has
             been cautioned time and again that the Court
             should be very wary in staying the conviction
             especially in the types of cases referred to above
             and it shall be done only in very rare and
             exceptional cases of irreparable injury coupled
             with irreversible consequences resulting in
             injustice.”
             In the case of Purna Chandra Kisan -Vrs.- State
of Orissa reported in 2017(II) ILR -CUT- 406, it is held as
follows:-
             “10. No doubt, for the aforesaid stigma of
             conviction is likely to lead removal from the
             service if the employer so desired and in that
             event, he as well as his family members shall
             suffer. The injury that the petitioner-appellant is
             likely to suffer i.e. removal from service cannot
             be said to be irreparable injury coupled with
             irreversible consequences resulting in injustice.
             In the case of Shyam Narain Pandey (supra),
             it has been held that loss of job is no ground to
             stay/suspend the conviction.”
             In the case of Harihar Mishra -Vrs.- Republic of
India reported in (2010) 47 Orissa Criminal Reports 236,
it is held as follows:-

                      17
“10. From the discussion as aforesaid, five broad
principles emerge, which, in my considered
view, is a guide so far as exercise of discretion
under Section 389(1), Code of Criminal
Procedure in relation to stay/ suspension of
conviction is concerned. They may be called the
'Panchasheel' for exercise of discretion under
Section 389(1), Code of Criminal Procedure for
suspension of an order of conviction. They are -
(i) The Appellant, who seeks interference of the
Appellate Court under Section 389(1), Code of
Criminal Procedure so far as the order of
conviction is concerned, must come with clean
hands, and with due frankness and fairness
specifically draw attention of the Appellate Court
to the specific consequences he is going to
suffer, if discretion by the Court is not exercised
in his favour.
(ii) Such discretion by the Appellate Court may
be exercised in favour of the appellant only in
rare and exceptional cases depending upon the
special facts of the case and not as a matter of
course.
(iii) Such discretion may be exercised only
where failure to stay the conviction would lead
to injustice and irreversible consequences. The
Court has to examine carefully on the basis of
materials supplied and materials available on
record as to whether the consequences sought
to visit the appellant at present or on a future
date is/are real.
(iv) While exercising the discretion, the
Appellate Court has a duty to look at all the
aspects including ramification of keeping the
conviction in abeyance, and it is under further

                                 18
             obligation to support its order for reasons to be
             recorded by it in writing.
             (v) In case of public servants convicted of
             corruption charges, the discretion should not be
             exercised.”
8.           On the face of the impugned judgment of the learned
trial Court, it is apparent that after acquitting the petitioner of
the charges under sections 420, 468, 201 and 120-B of the
Indian Penal Code, the learned trial Court has not assigned any
specific reason for convicting the petitioner under section 13(2)
read with section 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act. The finding, if any,
so far as that offence is concerned relating to execution of
agreement on 10.09.2004 is against the petitioner and co-
accused Abakash Padhy who has been acquitted of all the
charges. The learned trial Court has not taken into consideration
that the first agreement was in respect of a work having a
different patch of the road whereas the second agreement was
for the repair work of pot hole after the rainy season and flood.
It has not taken into consideration that as the first contractor did
not execute the work which was necessary due to damage of the
road on account of rainy season followed by heavy flood and
abandoned the work, show cause notice was issued to him and
keeping in view the urgency and requirement of repair for

                               19
convenience of public, second agreement was executed by way
of tender and that time stipulated in the first contract had
already elapsed and therefore, there was nothing wrong in
executing the second agreement. When the charge of criminal
conspiracy has failed and it is observed that there appears
nothing to the fact that the petitioner had conspired with other
co-accused   persons   to  grab   the  Govt.    fund  allotted for
construction of pot-holes and the petitioner and all other co-
accused persons have been acquitted of such charge, it was the
duty on the part of the learned trial Court to discuss the
ingredients of the offence under section 13(1)(d) which is
punishable under section 13(2) of the 1988 Act and after
discussing the evidence on record, to give a finding thereon as to
how the ingredients of such offence so far as the petitioner is
concerned, is attracted.
            Section 354 of Cr.P.C. which deals with language and
contents of judgment, inter alia, states that the judgment shall
contain the point or points for determination, the decision
thereon and the reasons for the decision.
            In the present case even though the learned trial
Court has formulated the point that “if the accused persons,
during the year 2002 to 2004, being the public servants had

                                  20
abused their position as such public servant and thereby
obtained pecuniary advantage of Rs.1,50,000/- entrusted to
them and committed criminal misconduct” which has got
relevance to the charge under section 13(1)(d) read with section
13(2) of 1988 Act but while discussing such charge, the learned
trial Court has given its finding in paragraph-7 that the petitioner
and the co-accused persons Sudarsan Patra and Prasanta Kumar
Patra were ‘public servants’ within the meaning of public servant
as defined in section 2 of the 1988 Act. The learned trial Court
further held in paragraph 12 that co-accused Abakash Padhy had
executed the work. Thereafter, the learned trial Court discussed
the core issue that when one agreement was subsisting then
whether a second agreement for the same work has got legal
sanctity or not. After discussing the evidence, the learned trial
Court has arrived at a finding that on 22.09.2004, notice of show
cause vide Ext.Q was issued to Arun Kumar Choudhury which
means till 22.09.2004, the earlier contract with Arun Kumar
Choudhury was not rescinded and was very much in force in
view of clause 2(b)(1) of the conditions of contract but on
10.09.2004 the petitioner as Executive Engineer had entered into
an agreement with co-accused Abakas Padhy vide Agreement
no. 1F2/04-05 for the self same work with commencement and

                                 21
completion date as 10.09.2004 and 09.03.2005 and as such, the
subsequent contract i.e. 1F2/04-05 entered into in between
petitioner and Abakas Padhy was illegal.
             After giving such finding, the learned trial Court has
discussed the charges under sections 420, 468, 120-B and 201
of the Indian Penal Code and disbelieved the prosecution case
relating to such charges. Thereafter, the learned trial Court has
suddenly jumped to the conclusion in paragraph 29 that the
prosecution has successfully established the offence under
section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of 1989 Act against the
petitioner and co-accused persons Sudarsan Sahani, Prasanta
Kumar Patra. Therefore, it is apparent that there is no specific
finding relating to the charges under section 13(2) read with
section 13(1)(d) of 1988 Act. The learned trial Court has
overlooked the material evidence and therefore, the conclusion
arrived at for such charge against the petitioner is totally
misconceived.
             A duty is cast on the trial Court to arrive at the truth
and to render justice. If the trial Court shrinks from its duty and
responsibility then it would make a mockery of the criminal
justice delivery system. If a reasoned judgment is not passed by
the trial Court and a party is left in darkness in searching for the

                                 22
reasons as to why he has been convicted or why an accused has
been acquitted then not only the parties to the case but also the
society at large who are expecting a sound and reasoned
judgment would raise accusing finger against the Judge either
for his incapability or otherwise which would tilt the basic
structure of the foundation of administration of justice.
            In case of Prasad @ Hariprasad Acharaya –Vrs.-
State of Karnataka reported in A.I.R. 2009 Supreme Court
1911 where the High Court of Karnataka had upheld the
conviction of the appellant passed by the learned trial Court
without assigning any reasons, it is held as follows:-
            “8. Reasons introduce clarity in an order. On
            plainest consideration of justice, the High Court
            ought to have set forth its reasons, howsoever
            brief, in its order indicative of an application of
            its mind. The absence of reasons has rendered
            the High Court's judgment not sustainable.
            9. Even in respect of administrative orders Lord
            Denning, M.R. in Breen v. Amalgamated Engg.
            Union (1971) 1 All ER 1148, observed: "The
            giving of reasons is one of the fundamentals of
            good administration." In Alexander Machinery
            (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree 1974 ICR 120 (NIRC)
            it was observed: "Failure to give reasons
            amounts to denial of justice." "Reasons are live
            links between the mind of the decision-taker to
            the controversy in question and the decision or
            conclusion arrived at." Reasons substitute
            subjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis on

                                 23
            recording reasons is that if the decision reveals
            the "inscrutable face of the sphinx", it can, by its
            silence, render it virtually impossible for the
            courts to perform their appellate function or
            exercise the power of judicial review in
            adjudging the validity of the decision. Right to
            reason is an indispensable part of a sound
            judicial system; reasons at least sufficient to
            indicate an application of mind to the matter
            before Court. Another rationale is that the
            affected party can know why the decision has
            gone against him. One of the salutary
            requirements of natural justice is spelling out
            reasons for the order made; in other words, a
            speaking-out. The "inscrutable face of the
            sphinx" is ordinarily incongruous with a judicial
            or quasi-judicial performance.”
             In case of Mukhtiar Singh and another -Vrs.-
State of Punjab reported in A.I.R. 1995 S.C. 686, it is held
that a decision does not mean the ‘conclusion’, it embraces
within its fold the reasons which form the basis for arriving at
the ‘conclusions’. In case of Prem Kaur -Vrs.- State of Punjab
reported in A.I.R. 2013 S.C. 2083, it is held that the Court
must give reasons for reaching its conclusion.
             The recording of reasons in a judgment is an
essential requirement because such reasons can alone show
whether the Court has applied its mind to all the facts and
circumstances relevant to the point in dispute. Reasons form the

                                 24
substratum of the decision. If reasons are not given for arriving
at a conclusion, the judgment is robbed of one of the most
essential ingredients and forfeits its claim to be termed a
judgment in the eye of law. Recording of reasons necessarily
implies the appreciation and consideration of evidence. A
judgment written in a proper manner containing reasons for
finding by the trial Court is of considerable help to the Appellate
Court. A judgment which does not fulfil the basic and essential
requirement of section 354 of Cr.P.C. is not only a defective
judgment but in fact it is no judgment in the eye of law. A
judgment not in conformity with the provisions of section 354 of
Cr.P.C. is a nullity. The absence of reasons goes to the root of
the matter and it is not a mere irregularity but a patent illegality
which cannot be cured under section 465 of Cr.P.C.
            Though in case of Harihar Mishra (supra) while
formulating panchasheel for exercise of discretion under section
389(1) Cr.P.C. for suspension of an order of conviction, a learned
single Judge of this Court has held in case of public servant
convicted of corruption charges, the discretion should not be
exercised but the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of K.C. Sareen
(supra), has held that the power to suspend an order of
conviction, apart from the order of sentence, is not alien to

                                  25
section 389(1) of the Code, its exercise should be limited to very
exceptional cases: Similarly the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case
of Balakrishana Dattatraya Kumbhar (supra), while dealing
with a case under 1988 Act, has held that the Appellate Court in
an exceptional case, may put the conviction in abeyance along
with the sentence but such power must be exercised with great
circumspection and caution, for the purpose of which, the
appellant must satisfy the Court as regard the evil that is likely
to befall him, if the said conviction is not suspended. The Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case of Shyam Narain Pandey (supra) has
held that it has been cautioned time and again that the Court
should be very wary in staying the conviction especially in the
types of cases referred to above and it shall be done only in very
rare and exceptional cases of irreparable injury coupled with
irreversible consequences resulting in injustice.
9.           Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the
case, when the impugned judgment of the learned trial Court
exhibits a stony silence regarding the reasons for arriving at the
conclusions against the petitioner and the conclusions against
the petitioner suffers from total non-application of mind and
material evidence on record has been overlooked, in view of the
fallacy in the impugned judgment as discussed above, I am of

                                      26
humble view that if the impugned judgment of conviction so far
the petitioner is concerned is not stayed/suspended, by the time
the appeal is taken up for hearing and decided finally, much
water will be flown under the bridge and the evil that would
likely to befall on the petitioner in the meantime would
aggravate and it would be too late to set the clock back. I am of
the further view that the petitioner has made out an exceptional
case for stay/suspension of conviction. It is one of such
exceptional cases where the order of conviction should be
stayed/suspended otherwise it would cause irreparable loss and
injury coupled with irreversible consequences resulting in serious
miscarriage of justice to the petitioner.
10.               Accordingly, the order of conviction passed against
the appellant-petitioner by the learned Special Judge (Vigilance),
Phulbani in G.R. Case No. 08 of 2013 (v) (T.R. No. 08 of 2013) is
stayed/suspended pending disposal of the appeal.
                  The Misc. Case is accordingly allowed.
                                                    ..……………………….
