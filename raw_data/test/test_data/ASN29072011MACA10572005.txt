                       THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA
                           Heard and disposed of on 29.7.2011
        ___________________________________________________________________________
B.N.Mahapatra, J.          This is an appeal under section 173 of the Motor
        Vehicles Act,1988 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’) filed by the
        claimant-appellant challenging the award dated 13.9.2005 passed by
        the 2nd.Addl.District Judge-Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Cuttack
        (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Tribunal’) in M.V.Misc.Case No.1045 of
        1998 on the ground that the amount of compensation awarded by the
        Tribunal is at lower side.

                                    2
2.           The facts of the case are that on 17.1.1998 at about 4.00
P.M.    while   the   claimant-appellant    was   proceeding    towards
O.M.P.Square on his bicycle, a Police Van bearing Registration
No.OSU-3043 being driven in a rash and negligent manner dashed
against the claimant-appellant, as a result of which he fell down on
the road from his bicycle, sustained injuries and became senseless.
He was immediately taken to the Police Hospital for his treatment and
thereafter shifted to S.C.B.Medical College Hospital, Cuttack for better
treatment. In the said accident, the claimant-appellant sustained
fracture injuries on his hand and leg. The claimant-appellant
underwent treatment in the said hospital as an indoor patient
from19.1.1998 to 5.2.1998.
             With these facts the claimant-appellant filed a claim
petition before the learned Tribunal claiming compensation of
Rs.3,50,000/-.
3.           The respondent denied any accident to have taken place,
and took the plea that the accident, if any, was due to the negligence
of the claimant.
4.           The claimant examined three witnesses including himself
as P.W.1 and produced eight documents marked as Exts.1 to 8 in
support of his claim.

                                       3
              Though the respondent examined one witness as O.P.W.1,
who is the driver of the offending vehicle, no document was produced
on behalf of it.
5.            The learned Tribunal after taking into consideration both
oral and documentary evidence came to the conclusion that the
accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of
the offending vehicle and the claimant-appellant is entitled to get
compensation of Rs.18,000/- and directed the opposite party to pay
the said amount with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the
date of filing of the application, i.e., 27.11.1998.
6.            According to the appellant, due to the accident he
sustained injuries on his right fore-arm. Dr.T.Mohanty, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the claimant-appellant submits that as
per the report of the specialist in Orthopedic the claimant has
sustained 50% disability. Therefore, the amount of compensation
should not have been less than Rs.2,07,200/-. Dr.Mohanty, learned
counsel for the claimant-appellant further submits that       since the
mater is of the year 1998 and the claimant-appellant is suffering a lot,
the same may be disposed of in the manner and spirit in which the
motor vehicle accident claim cases are disposed of in Lok Adalat, to
which the learned Addl. Standing Counsel has no objection.
7.            Learned Addl. Standing Counsel appearing for the State
submits that there is no infirmity or illegality in the order of the

                                      4
Tribunal and the certificate of disability produced by the claimant was
not proved before the Tribunal and the same has not been issued by a
Medical Board. It is further submitted that the certificate of disability
cannot be accepted since it is not a genuine document.
8.             The only dispute in the present appeal is as to whether
the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal is just
compensation.
9.             It is not in dispute that in the accident the claimant-
appellant sustained injury in his right fore-arm.
               Considering the submissions made by the learned counsel
for the parties and going through the impugned order and evidence on
record     this    Court  feels further  consolidated  compensation    of
Rs.15,000/- in the present case would be just and proper.
10.            In view of the above, the Respondent is directed to pay a
further consolidated sum of Rs.15,000/-(Rupees fifteen thousand) to
the claimant-appellant within a period of eight weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order. The entire amount of Rs.15,000/-
(Rupees fifteen thousand) be deposited before the Tribunal. On deposit
of the said amount, the Tribunal shall disburse the same to the
claimant-appellant on proper identification.
                                                      ………………………
