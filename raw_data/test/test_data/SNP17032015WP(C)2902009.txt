              Smt.Suchitra Panda           … Petitioner
                                           –vs-
              Director, Sociel Welfare
              Department and others        … Opp. Parties
10. 17.3.2015             The petitioner has challenged part of the order dated
               26.12.2008     passed    by   the   Director, Women    and   Child
               Development Department, Government of Orissa.
                          Brief facts of the case that the petitioner in terms of
               the advertisement published on the basis of the guideline in
               vogue but a fresh selection process was initiated on the basis of
               the revised guideline which according to the petitioner is
               contrary to law because the moment the advertisement has been
               issued, the selection process is supposed to be concluded on the
               basis of the old guideline in operative but the authorities have
               decided to initiate a fresh selection process on the basis of the
               new guideline.
                          Contention of the learned counsel that the petitioner
               had participated in the process and on the basis of the said
               selection petitioner was placed at serial no.1 while private
               opposite party no.4 was found at serial no.2.
                          On the basis of the performance in interview which
               was    held   on   6.6.2006,     result was   declared  and   final
               marks-sheets was sent to the Zilla Parishad, Puri. Zilla Parishad,
               Puri has approved the list of 16 candidates out of 19 candidates
               sent by the C.D.P.O., Nimapara on 29.6.2006, in pursuance of
               the approval of the candidates by the Zilla Parishad, Puri
               appointment letter was issued to the petitioner by the C.D.P.O.,
               Nimapara vide order dated 14.11.2006 and after joining in terms
               of the appointment letter petitioner was sent on training from
               19.1.2007 to 17.2.2007 which the petitioner has successfully
               concluded and after completion of the training the petitioner
               worked as Anganwadi Worker and also received her salary but in

                     2
the meanwhile the private opposite party no.4 has challenged
the selection of the petitioner by way of preferring a writ petition
being W.P.C. No.10052 of 2006 challenging engagement of the
petitioner on the ground that the certificate of experience
furnished by the petitioner is forge one, the writ petition was
disposed of vide order dated 25.8.2006 directing opposite party
no.6 ( opposite party no.4 in this writ petition) to file
representation before the Director, Women & Child Welfare
Department who will dispose of the same giving opportunity of
hearing to the parties.
            The opposite party no.4 approached before the
Director, Women & Child Welfare Department              which was
disposed of directing the concerned Collector to calculate the
marks ignoring the marks awarded for experience to the
petitioner.
           The petitioner being aggrieved with the decision of the
Director has filed a writ petition being W.P.(C) No.3250 of 2007
which was disposed of vide order dated 1.9.2008 remanding the
matter before the Director, Women & Child Welfare Department
for passing a fresh order.
           The Director, Women & Child Welfare Department has
passed an order afresh but based upon the new guideline
(Annexure-12) which is impugned in this writ petition.
           Ground taken by the learned counsel for the petitioner
that the selection process once started solely based upon the
rules/regulations/guideline which was prevalent at that time of
issuance of advertisement and if in the meanwhile a new

                     3
guideline has come, selection process will not be governed on the
basis of the new guideline, the Director   while disposing of the
same, stating therein that since the Department has changed
the guideline where marks of experience will not be considered
any more, hence it has been directed not to give weightage of
marks on account of experience having with the petitioner.
          On the other hand, learned counsel for the opposite
party-State has submitted that the Director has passed the order
keeping in mind the new guideline on the day when the decision
was taken by the authority, hence there is no infirmity in the
order passed by the Director in Annexure-12.
          Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents available on record.
          Fact which is not in dispute is that the selection
process was initiated in which petitioner having successful, was
engaged but in one pretext or the other engagement order of the
petitioner was challenged by the private opposite party no.4
which led to initiation of a proceeding for adjudicating the
dispute and ultimately the matter was placed before the
Director, Women & Child Welfare Department pursuant to the
order passed by this Court, but in the meanwhile new guideline
has come which provides not to give any weightage of marks on
account of experience having held by candidate while on earlier
guideline there was provision to provide weightage on the basis
of the experience if having with the candidate.
          The petitioner admittedly was engaged on the basis of
the guideline which was operative on the date when the

                      4
advertisement was issued and on the basis of experience marks
of experience having with the petitioner, but however, her
appointment was challenged regarding submission of forge
experience certificate by the private opposite party and the
matter has been sent before the authority to decide afresh by
this Court in the order passed under the writ jurisdiction, but in
the meanwhile, a new guideline has been promulgated where
there is no provision of giving weightage of marks on account of
experience having with the candidate.        The issue which was
raised by the private opposite party was regarding genuineness
of experience certificate and on that ground the matter was
remanded before the authority concerned but such issue has not
been decided, rather the issue has been deviated on the not
giving weightage marks on the basis of experience having with
the candidate and accordingly direction has been given to the
opposite parties regarding holding of interview afresh.
           It is settled principles of law that selection process
was initiated solely on the basis of rules prevalent at the time
of issuance of advertisement and policy if changed in the
midway of the selection cannot govern selection process as has
already been held by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
Sonia –vs- Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. and others, reported
in (2007) 10 SCC 627 wherein at paragraph-10 it has been
held:
       “In N.T.Devin Katti v. Karnataka Public Service
       Commission this Court held that where selection
       process has been intiated by issuing an
       advertisement inviting applications, selection
       should normally be regulated by the rule or order
       then prevalent and also when advertisement

                     5
       expressly states that the appointment shall be
       made in accordance with the existing rule or order,
       subsequent amendment in the existing rule or
       order will not affect the pending selection process
       unless contrary intention is expressly or impliedly
       indicated.”
           Here, in this case since the petitioner has been
selected and started discharging her duty on the basis of the
weightage having experience with the petitioner, but instead of
deciding the issued the Director, Women & Child Welfare
Department      has deferred the issue and gone into the case to
the new guideline where provision of awarding extra marks is
no more a provision.
           In that view of the matter and on the basis of the
reasons made above, the part of the order by which fresh
interview has been directed to be conducted is hereby quashed
and the matter is remitted before the Director, Women & Child
Welfare Department       to take a decision regarding genuineness
of experience certificate within a period of eight weeks from the
date of receipt of copy of this order.
           It is needless to that while passing the order the
Director, Women & Child Welfare Department             shall provide
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner as well as to the private
opposite party no.4 and pass a reasoned order.
           The outcome of the decision of the Director, Women
& Child Welfare Department         will follow further action by the
competent authority regarding engagement of the petitioner.

                   6
          Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of with the
aforesaid observation.
                                      …………………..
