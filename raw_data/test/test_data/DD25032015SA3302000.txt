      Date of hearing : 16.02.2015                 :        Date of judgment:             25.03.2015
_________________________________________________________________
                  This appeal has been filed calling in question the judgment and
decree passed by the Addl. District Judge, Kendrapara , in Title Appeal
No.1/32/90/98 confirming the judgment and decree passed by the learned
Addl. Munsif, Kendrapara in Title Suit No. 178/1985.
         By the said judgments, the suit filed by the respondent, as the
plaintiffs against the defendant-appellants has been decreed and they have
been permanently injuncted and thereby restrained from interfering with
the peaceful possession of the respondents over the suit land.

                                      // 2 //
       2.     For the shake of convenience, for clarity and to avoid confusion
the parties herein after have been referred, as they have been arraigned in
the court below.
       3.     The plaintiffs claim is that their father Ghana Mallik had
purchased the suit land together with other lands by registered sale-deed
dated 26.10.1923 and accordingly the same stood recorded in his favour as
per the record of rights of the year 1930. The father of the plaintiffs was in
cultivating the possession of the suit land as its owner and after his death
the plaintiffs continued as such. It is stated that the rent was also being
paid all along. In all settlement operation the name of the plaintiffs stood
recorded as having the title and possession over the suit land. Parcha was
accordingly issued. Next it is alleged that the defendant having no right, title
and interest over the suit land nor having remained in possession over the
same at any point of time, suddenly gave threats to the plaintiffs to disposes
them from the suit land and cause damage to the standing crops raised by
them. So, the suit with the relief as stated above has been filed.
       4.     The defendants contested the suit questioning the sale-deed
which is projected by the plaintiff as the basis of the right title interest and
possession in their favour. They also challenged the settlement record of
rights. Then advanced a claim that the property belong to their ancestors
and hence is in their possessions. An alternative case has also been set up
that they have acquired title by adverse possession over the suit land having

                                      // 3 //
remained in possession openly, peaceably and continuously for upward of
the statutory period as the owner of the same with hostile animus.
       5.     On such rival pleadings four issues have been settled by the
trial court. Rightly dealing with issue no.3 at the first instance, the trial
court evaluating the evidence led by the parties in consonance with
respective pleadings has arrived at a finding that the plaintiffs right, title
interest as well as possession over the suit land stand established.          In
saying so the trial court has also dwelt upon the claim of the defendants.
First that the property if their ancestral property of plaintiffs and in their
possession as such and secondly the alternative claim of acquisition of title
by adverse possession as advanced, being examined with reference to
evidence, those have been answered in the negative.
       The lower appellate court has affirmed these findings and the appeal
filed by the present appellants has thus yielded no fruitful result for them.
       6.     Thus   appeal   has   been      admitted finding  the    following
substantial questions of law for determination.
       i)    Whether the defendants are seriously prejudiced for non
             framing of issue relating to adverse possession and identity of
             the suit land inspite of specific pleadings in para-10 of the
             written statement?
       ii)   Whether the courts below committed serious illegality declaring
             the title of the plaintiffs without considering and discussing
             documentary and oral evidence adduced by the defendants?

                                     // 4 //
       7.     Learned counsel for the appellants submits that despite of the
specific pleading raising the dispute with regard to the identity of the suit
land and also specific alternative case set up by the defendants as regards
acquisition of title by adverse possession, the courts below having not
framed issues to that effect, the prejudice to the defendants is writ large.
So, he contends that the judgments and decrees are vitiated. Alternative
submission remains that even in the event it is found that no such
prejudice is caused for non framing of the issues as above, the findings are
perverse, as while doing said exercise the material evidence both
documentary and oral led by the defendants have not at all been touched.
In support of the above submission, he has placed reliance on a decision in
case of Haryana State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd and
others Vrs. Seema Sharma and others, 2009 AIR SCW 4511.
       8.     Learned counsel for the respondents submits that here though
the trial court has not framed specific issue as pointed by learned counsel
for the appellants, nonetheless those controversies have been dealt in great
detail taking into consideration the evidence in the touch stone of the
pleadings and thereafter specific findings have been rendered such as (1)
the plaintiffs have established the identity of the suit land, (ii) the plaintiffs
have proved their title over the suit land (iii) there is failure by the
defendants to establish a case of acquisition of title by adverse possession
proving all the classical requirements by leading clear, cogent and
acceptable evidence.

                                      // 5 //
       9.     In order to address the rival submission, let us first give a
careful reading to the judgment of the trial court. The issue framed is as to
whether the plaintiff has the title right interest over the suit land. It has to
be borne in mind that the plaintiffs being aware about the dispute raised by
the defendants as regards the identity of the suit land have laid evidence
and naturally the defendants have so done in view of their specific case. The
trial court as it appears in such clear and specific terms had not said that
the suit land is properly identifiable and that it is covered under the sale
deed followed by the record of rights. However, the lower appellate court
being conscious of it has given a clear finding on reappraisal of evidence
which was well within its competence. The finding is that:- xx        xx xx as
well as on the basis of the documents, it is well established that the land
purchased under Ext.1 relates to the suit plot distinctly and clearly. The
plaintiffs father’s purchase of the land under the registered sale-deed had
also been held by the trial court. But whether the same relates to the suit
land or not had not been so clearly stated by the court below. The lower
appellate court in view of the rival pleadings has made the right approach.
For the purpose, it has gone to examine the documentary evidence which
are most important after having a searching examination of the description
of the land under Ext.1, the R.O.Rs of 1930 of the suit land, Ex.5 and the
recent Parcha, Ext.5/1 has arrived at a definite conclusion at para 11 of the
judgment as under:-
              “xxxx       xxxx         xxxx               xxxx

                                        // 6 //
               xxxx         xxxx         xxxx                xxxx
        11. That being so, manifestly there appears no ambiguity as to the
        identity of the suit land. Plaintiffs have also sold some plots out of the
        suit Khata to one Kanhu Charan Parida under registered sale deed
        dtd. 29.7.48 which has been reflected in Ext.2 and Ext.7. Hence on
        the basis of the documents, it is well established that the land
        purchased under Ext. 1 relates to the distinctly and clearly.
         This is a finding of pure fact. Learned counsel for the appellant in
course of hearing has not been able to show any material to entertain doubt
over such identity of the suit land, so as to hold to the contrary it.
        10.    Next, while dealing the question of title in respect of the suit
land as claimed by the plaintiffs, the courts below have also dealt the claim
of the defendants about acquisition of title by adverse possession. In fact
both the issues are intertwined and practically to decide the claim of
acquisition of title by adverse possession against the plaintiffs, unless the
antecedent title of the plaintiffs stands admitted, the defendants can have
no base for the claim perfection of title by way of adverse possession
fulfilling all other legal requirement including the most important one i.e by
denying the title of the plaintiffs and showing necessary hostile animus.
        The object behind Order 14 rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and
the very purpose of framing of issues is to answer all the controversies
arising between the parties, in view of rival case, so, that in future further
litigation for the same controversy are avoided and that there occurs no
mistrial that the parties having raised an issue for determination having
impact on the result are provided with no answer upon due adjudication. A

                                      // 7 //
party can claim prejudice for non framing of an issue where the answer
given on a particular point causes surprise to him as he was not in a
position to counter it tendering evidence and thereby duly taking part in the
hearing of the suit for adjudication of said controversy.
       It has been held in the case of Hedunuri v. Sampati; AIR 1963 SC
884 that:-
       “ No doubt no issue was framed, and the one which was framed could
have been more elaborate. But since the parties went to trial fully knowing
the rival case and let all the evidence not only in support of their
contentions but in refutation of those of the other side, it cannot be said
that the absence of an issue was fatal to the case or that there was that
mistrial which vitiates proceedings”.
       This is not the case here. The aforesaid observations have full
application in the facts and circumstances of this case. There was pleading
on the point. Both the parties entered into evidence with full knowledge of
respective cases on the question of rival claim of title as also the
extinguishment of the title by way of adverse possession as asserted by the
defendant. The courts below have dealt the claim of the defendants with
regard to the acquisition of title over the suit land by adverse possession
completely under separate para giving all the importance, examining the
evidence on record both oral and documentary, keeping in view the settled
principle of law holding the field. Most importantly, the evidence of D.W.4
who is a defendant has been found to have given the fatal blow and to have

                                     // 8 //
dealt an axe blow in cutting the legs of the case of the defendants. He has
not spoken regarding the plea of adverse possession, no documentary
evidence comes in support of such plea. The suit having been filed in the
year 1989, it is not been shown in the evidence as to from which year the
defendants remained in possession; whether by then they had completed
their possession for more than a period of 12 years or not. The plaintiffs
title having been found, the defendants are burdened to establish their
claim of adverse possession to non-suit the plaintiffs. That has been found
to have not at all been proved by the defendants leading clear, cogent and
satisfactory evidence.
       11.    The decision cited in case of Hariyana State Electronics
Development Corporation Ltd (Supra) concerned with a suit questioning
the criteria’s for promotion in service. The controversy was as to whether
the promotion was as ‘per merit-cum-seniority’ which was pleaded by the
defendant. In that case the courts below had not gone to decide this vital
point. So that was a case where neither the issue was framed, nor a
decision had been rendered, which was absolutely necessary to decide the
fate of the suit. If it would be as per merit-cum-seniority, the angle of
further examination would have been different. Thus the decision appears
to be of no help to the present case for accepting the submission of the
learned for the appellants. Here the general issue of title over the suit land
remains, parties have laid evidence, the courts below have decided the title
of the suit land as per the claim of the plaintiffs vis a vis the claim of the

                                            // 9 //
defendants claiming title unto themselves which are inseparable when also
the question of identity has also been dealt therein. The finding on factum
of possession has been rendered upon scrutiny of evidence and in this
connection all the evidences have been taken into consideration giving them
their due weight as they are entitled to get in the eye of law wherein no such
perversity surfaces.
                    With the aforesaid discussion, the substantial questions of law
formulated for determination in this appeal are accordingly answered.
          12.       In the net result, the second appeal stands dismissed. In the
facts and circumstances, parties are to bear their respective cost
throughout.
