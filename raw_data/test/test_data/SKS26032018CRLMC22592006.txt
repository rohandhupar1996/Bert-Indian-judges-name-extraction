        P R E S E N T:
                          THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Date of Hearing & Judgment: 26.03.2018
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. K. SAHOO, J.           The petitioner Bidyadhar Samal in this application
        under section 482 of Cr.P.C. has challenged the impugned order
        dated 20.06.2002 passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Baramba in
        G.R. Case No. 49 of 2000 in taking cognizance of the offences
        under sections 450/376/506 of the Indian Penal Code and

                                 2
section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereafter in short ‘SC & ST
(POA) Act’) and issuance of process against him. The said case
arises out of Baramba P.S. Case No.49 of 2000.
             It appears that on the basis of first information
report submitted by the victim before the officer in charge of
Baramba police station on 28.04.2000, Baramba P.S. Case No.49
of 2000 was registered under sections 450/376/506 of the Indian
Penal Code and section 3 of the SC & ST (PA) Act. After
registration of the case, the officer in charge himself took up
investigation of the case, examined the victim and other
witnesses, visited the spot, seized incriminating materials, sent
the victim for medical examination, seized the wearing apparels
and vaginal swab of the victim collected by the Medial Officer
and prayed before the learned J.M.F.C., Baramba for recording
the 164 Cr.P.C. statement of the victim, seized the caste
certificate of the victim and then on his transfer, the charge of
investigation was taken over by his successor on 18.03.2001
who obtained the medial examination report of the victim,
conducted raid at different places for arresting the petitioner and
subsequently on his transfer, his successor took over charge of
investigation on 08.05.2002. On 15.05.2002 the S.D.P.O.,

                                 3
Athagarh took over charge of investigation and on 02.06.2002,
he submitted charge sheet under sections 450/376/506 of the
Indian Penal Code and section 3 of the SC & ST (PA) Act.
            None appears on behalf of the petitioner so also on
behalf of the informant.
            On perusal of the grounds taken in the CRLMC
application, it is mentioned that the ingredients of offence under
section 376 of the Indian Penal Code are not attracted and since
the investigation has been conducted substantially by the Officer
in charge of Baramba police station and the S.D.P.O., Athagarh
after taking over the charge of investigation formally submitted
charge sheet, therefore, the order of taking cognizance under
section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act is vitiated in the eye of law in
view of the Rule 7 of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 (hereafter “SC & ST
(POA) Rules”)
            Mr.    Prem   Kumar   Patnaik,  learned   Addl.   Govt.
Advocate produced the case diary and submitted that the
statement of the victim is very clear regarding the commission of
offence under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. He placed
the statement of the victim.

                                 4
            After going through the first information report which
was lodged by the victim who is a married lady as well as her
statement, it appears that she has clearly stated that in the
intervening night of 26/27.04.2000, the petitioner entered inside
her house and committed rape on her and gave threat to her not
to disclose about the incident before anybody. On the basis of
materials on record, prima facie case under section 376 of the
Indian Penal Code is clearly made out and therefore, no fault can
be found with the investigating officer in submitting the charge
sheet under sections 450, 376 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code
and also with the Magistrate in taking cognizance of such
offences.
            So far as the offence under section 3 of the SC & ST
(PA) Act is concerned, Rule 7 of SC & ST (POA) Rules reads as
follows:-
            “7.   Investigating  Officer  -   (1)  An     offence
            committed under the Act shall be investigated
            by a police officer not below the rank of a
            Deputy     Superintendent      of     Police.     The
            investigating officer shall be appointed by the
            State     Government/Director         General      of
            Police/Superintendent of Police after taking into
            account his past experience, sense of ability and
            justice to perceive the implications of the case

                                  5
            and investigate it along with right lines within
            the shortest possible time.
                   (2) The investigating officer so appointed
            under     sub-rule    (1)   shall   complete    the
            investigation on top priority basis within thirty
            days     and    submit     the    report   to   the
            Superintendent     of  Police   who   in  turn will
            immediately forward the report to the Director
            General of Police to the State Government.”
                   (3) The Home Secretary and the Social
            Welfare Secretary to the State Government,
            Director of Prosecution, the officer in-charge of
            Prosecution and the Director General of Police
            shall review by the end of the every quarter the
            position   of  all  investigations   done   by  the
            investigating officer.
            In case of Maheswar Panda -Vrs.- State of Orissa
reported in (2003) 24 Orissa Criminal Reports 135 where
the petitioner challenged the sustainability of the order of taking
cognizance under section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act and also
the maintainability of the charge sheet on the ground that the
investigation was done by an officer below the rank of D.S.P., it
was held as follows:-
            “9. The provision in Section 9 of the Act, Rule 7
            of the Rules, Section 4 of the Cr.P.C. and the
            aforesaid ratio leads the situation to irresistible

                       6
conclusion that an investigation to an offence
under Section 3 of the Act by an officer not
appointed in terms of the said provision of law is
illegal  and    invalid.   But  when    the  offences
complained are both under the Indian Penal
Code and      any   of   the   offences   enumerated
in Section 3 of the Act, then the investigation
which is being made by a competent Police
Officer    in   accordance      with   the  provision
in Cr.P.C. cannot be and should not be quashed
for     non-investigation        of    the    offence
under Section 3 of the Act by a competent Police
Officer.    In   such    a  situation   the  Criminal
Proceeding shall proceed in appropriate Court
for the offences punishable under the Indian
Penal Code notwithstanding investigation and
the charge-sheet being not liable to be accepted
only with respect to the offence under Section
3 of the Act for taking cognizance of that
offence.
10. Taking that view in the matter, so far the
present case is concerned, this Court finds that
the order of cognizance taken by the Sessions
Judge     -cum-Special      Judge,    Cuttack   being
contrary to the law pronounced by Apex Court in
the case of Gangula (supra), therefore, the
order of cognizance dated 20.08.1999 stands
quashed. It will be appropriate for the learned
Special Judge to remit the G.R. case to the

                                 7
          Court of concerned Magistrate who shall deal
          with the case for cognizance or otherwise but in
          accordance with law. If the prosecution shall
          move for investigation into the case by a
          competent Police Officer because of involvement
          of the offence under Section 3 of the Act, such
          application    be   duly   considered by  learned
          cognizance-taking Magistrate if the prosecution
          will take prompt steps in that respect within a
          period of six weeks.”
          In case of Basanta @ Basanta Kumar Palai -Vrs.-
State of Orissa reported in (2005) 31 Orissa Criminal
Reports 233, it is held as follows:-
          “On the allegation that mandatory provision of
          Rule 7 of the S.C. & S.T. (P.A.) Rules has been
          violated in G.R. Case No.1020 of 1999 wherein
          although the case was registered under Section
          3 of the S.C. & S.T. (P.A.) Act along with other
          sections of the Penal Code, the investigation was
          taken up by the A.S.I. of Police of Rajnagar
          Police Station and on the date of submission of
          charge sheet i.e. 17.04.2000, the S.D.P.O.,
          Kendrapara took charge of the investigation and
          submitted charge sheet on the very same day
          against the petitioners under Section 3 of the
          S.C. & S.T. (P.A.) Act along with other sections
          of the Indian Penal Code. This is very much

                                  8
             apparent from the copy of the charge sheet
             which is annexed to this petition. The S.D.P.O.
             has himself mentioned that he took charge of
             the investigation and submitted charge sheet on
             17.04.2000. There being a clear violation of the
             Rule 7 of the S.C. & S.T. (P.A.) Rules which
             mandates that the offence of the S.C. & S.T.
             (P.A.) Act has to be investigated into by the
             Gazette Police Officer not below the rank of
             D.S.P. and when that has not been done in this
             case, cognizance taken under Section 3 of S.C.
             & S.T. Act by the learned J.M.F.C., Pattamundai
             is hereby quashed. However, the case against
             the petitioner under the other penal provision
             shall continue.”
             In case of Pradeep Pradhan -Vrs.- State of
Orissa reported in (2005) 30 Orissa Criminal Reports 416,
this Court has held that since one of the offences involved in the
case was under section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act and the
investigation was conducted by the Sub Inspector of Police who
handed over the charge of investigation of the case to the
S.D.P.O., Sadar as per instruction of the Additional S.P. and the
S.D.P.O. except making search and raid for apprehending the
accused persons, had not done anything which can be construed
as ‘investigation’ as defined in section 2(h) of the Cr.P.C., charge
sheet so submitted by the D.S.P. can never be said to have been

                                   9
filed on the basis of investigation made by him in terms of the
statutory provisions and therefore, the investigation made is
illegal being violative of Rule 7 of the Rules and accordingly, the
order of taking cognizance under section 3 of the SC and ST
(POA) Act was set aside. If the charge sheet has been filed by
the D.S.P. on the basis of the investigation made by an officer
not in the rank of D.S.P., it can never be said to have been filed
on the basis of the investigation made by him in terms of
statutory provisions and, therefore, the investigation made is
illegal being violative of Rule 7 of the Rules.
             In case of Ranjit alias Rajat Ku. Das -Vrs.- State
of Orissa reported in (2003) 25 Orissa Criminal Reports
459, it is held that the investigation of the case which involves
also the offence under section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act was
conducted by the Sub Inspector of police but charge sheet was
submitted by the Deputy Superintendent of Police and therefore,
the order of taking cognizance of offence under section 3 of the
SC & ST (POA) Act was set aside.
             In   case   of  Sanjaya     Rout   -Vrs.- The   State
reported in (2005) 31 Orissa Criminal Reports 586, similar
view was also taken and cognizance taken by the learned

                                 10
Magistrate to prosecute the petitioner of the offence under
section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act was quashed.
            In the instant case, a perusal of the case diary clearly
shows that the first information report was registered under
section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act along with other offences but
in spite of that the investigation was conducted by three Sub-
Inspectors of police one after another who were acting as officer
in charge of the concerned police station and ultimately on
15.05.2002     the  S.D.P.O.,  Athagarh    took   over  charge    of
investigation as per the order of Supdt. of Police, Cuttack and he
formally submitted charge sheet on the basis of investigation
made by those earlier officers. Therefore, I am of the humble
view that the submission of the charge sheet for the offence
under section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act was not in accordance
with the statutory provisions i.e. Rule 7 of SC & ST (POA) Rules
which lays down that the investigation of such offence is not
permissible by an officer below the rank of D.S.P.
             Therefore, the order of taking cognizance of offence
under section 3 of the SC & ST (PA) Act stands quashed.
            The order of taking cognizance for the other offences
i.e. under sections 450/376/506 of the Indian Penal code passed
by the learned J.M.F.C., Baramba, stands confirmed.

                                       11
                 If    the   prosecution  moves  an    application  for
investigation of the case by a competent police officer for the
offence under section 3 of the SC & ST (POA) Act, such
application shall be considered by the learned Magistrate in
accordance with law within four weeks from today otherwise the
learned Magistrate shall proceed with the case in respect of the
other offences for which the order of taking cognizance by him
has been confirmed by this Court.
                 Accordingly, the CRLMC application is disposed of.
                                                    ….……………….....
