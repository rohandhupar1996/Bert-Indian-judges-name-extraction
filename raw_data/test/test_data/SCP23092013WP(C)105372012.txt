                                    W.P.(C) No.10537 of 2012
                                                &
                                  Misc. Case No.9156 of 2012
09. 23.09.2013               Heard learned counsel for the parties.
                             This writ petition has been filed, challenging the
               order dated 18.5.2012, passed by the learned Civil Judge
               (Jr.Divn.), Jeypore, in Election Petition No.01 of 2012, rejecting
               the petitioner’s application for time to file counter / show cause
               and setting the petitioner ex parte.
                             Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that by
               the impugned order, the petitioner has been deprived of his
               right to file counter/show cause to the election petition and
               contest the same, which has resulted in causing serious
               prejudice to him.
                             Learned counsel appearing for the opposite party
               no.1, with reference to the counter affidavit, submits that the
               petitioner has been resorting to all sorts of dilatory tactics to
               delay the proceeding and therefore, the learned Civil Judge was
               fully justified in rejecting the petitioner’s application for time to
               file counter and set him ex parte. It is further submitted that
               the petitioner, instead of filing an application under Order 9,
               Rule 7 CPC, to set aside the impugned order setting him ex
               parte, has rushed to this Court and has obtained an interim
               order, as a result of which, further proceeding in the Election
               Petition No.01 of 2012 has been stayed since 24.8.2012.
               Considering the submissions made and keeping in view the
               limited nature of grievance of the petitioner and without
mp

                           2
