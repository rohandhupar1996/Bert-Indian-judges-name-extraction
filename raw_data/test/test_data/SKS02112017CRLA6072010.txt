S. K. SAHOO, J.           The appellant E. Srinibas in CRLA No.591 of 2010,
        appellant Smt. Pyari Bag in CRLA No.566 of 2010, appellant Smt.

        of    learned        Sessions         Judge       -cum-       Judge,        Special       Court,
        Kandhamal-Boudh, Phulbani for offence punishable under section
        20(b) of the Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances Act
        (hereafter ‘N.D.P.S. Act’) on the accusation that on 07.09.2008
        at about 09.30 a.m. on the N.H. No.270 in front of Mahalaxmi
        Filling Station, Balliguda, in contravention of provision of section
        8 of the N.D.P.S. Act, they were found transporting 196 kgs. of
        ganja (cannabis).

                                  3
             The learned trial Court vide impugned judgment and
order dated 11.10.2010 found the appellants guilty under section
20(b)(ii)(C) of the N.D.P.S. Act and sentenced each of them to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of
Rs.1,00,000/- (rupees one lakh) each only, in default, to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for further period of two years.
2.           The prosecution case, as per the first information
report lodged by Sri K. N. Rao (P.W.8), Inspector in Charge of
Balliguda police station is that on 07.09.2008 while he along with
A.S.I. S.K. Mishra, C/471 Jaya Krushna Kanhar, C/442 Dusmanta
Pradhan were performing road blocking in front of Mahalaxmi
Filling Station, Balliguda in view of prevailing law and order
situation in presence of Executive Magistrate Manoj Kumar Swain
(P.W.9), they found one white colour Tata Sumo vehicle bearing
registration no.CG 04 H 1204 came from the side of Dandapadar
village and stopped near the road at 9.30 a.m. as barriers were
put on there. The informant while checking the vehicle found
four persons inside it, out of which two were male and two were
female. The male persons were sitting in the front seat whereas
the female persons were sitting behind in the back seat. Three
plastic bags and one coloured air bag were found in between the
front seat and the middle seat whereas six plastic bags were

                                4
found in the back portion of the vehicle. Smell of ganja was
emanating out of the vehicle. When the informant demanded the
identity of the occupants, the appellants who were there in the
vehicle disclosed their names and addresses and on query, they
told that the contents of the bags were ganja. The informant
intimated about the detention of the vehicle containing ganja to
his official superiors over phone and directed A.S.I. Arpita
Khatua (P.W.7) to come to the spot to remain present during
search of the vehicle. He also sent requisition to the Sub-
Collector, Baliguda to depute a Magistrate to remain present
during search of the vehicle and called two witnesses from the
locality namely Banamali Behera (P.W.1) and Subrat Kumar
Pradhan (P.W.2). The informant received intimation from the
office of the Sub-Collector, Baliguda that P.W.9 has been
deputed as Executive Magistrate to remain present during search
and seizure. The informant along with the other witnesses and
the Magistrate gave their personal search to the appellants and
nothing incriminating were found from their possession. The
vehicle was searched in presence of the witnesses and the
Executive Magistrate and three plastic bags and one air bag were
seized from the middle seat of the vehicle and six plastic bags
were seized from the back portion of the vehicle filled with

                                 5
flowering and fruiting tops of the cannabis plants (ganja). The
informant sent A.S.I. S.K. Mishra to call a person to come with
weighing instruments and to arrange sealing materials, covers
etc. for weighment, sealing and packing of ganja. Muna Patra
(P.W.4) arrived at the spot with weighing machine and other
required articles and he also gave his personal search and
nothing incriminating material was found from his possession.
The plastic bags were brought out from the vehicle and on
weighment, it was found that the plastic bags marked as “A”,
“B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, “H” “I” and “J” were containing
kg.23.750     grams,   kg.23.600    grams,    kg.23.000   grams,
kg.23.600     grams,   kg.24.500    grams,    kg.24.000   grams,
kg.10.200 grams, kg.23.250 grams, kg.17.300 grams and
kg.3.800 grams of ganja respectively and the total weight of the
ganja came to 196.00 kgs. Two samples of 50 grams each from
each of the bags were taken and those were marked as A-1, A-2,
B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2, D-1, D-2, E-1, E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1, G-2, H-1,
H-2, I-1, I-2 and J-1, J-2 respectively. The samples were kept in
polythene packets and those were kept in paper packets
separately and sealed with the personal seal of the informant.
The bulk ganja in the plastic bags were also sealed keeping
those   in  cotton   bags   separately   and  the  personal  seal

                                6
impressions of the informant were given on it. The weighment
slip and drug secret memos were prepared. The specimen
sample seal impression of the brass seal was taken on a plain
paper in presence of the witnesses and all the sample packets
along with bulk ganja were seized in presence of the witnesses
and the Executive Magistrate. The white colour Tata Sumo
vehicle was also seized in presence of the witnesses. The
personal brass seal of the informant with which all the sample
packets and bulk ganja bags were sealed, was left in the zima of
Banamali Behera (P.W.1) under zimanama. The copies of the
seizure lists which were prepared were handed over to the
appellants and their signatures were taken on the seizure lists.
Since the appellants were found transporting ganja in the Tata
Sumo vehicle without any authority, they were arrested by the
informant at 3.45 p.m. on 07.09.2008 after informing them the
grounds of arrest and after observing all formalities of arrest.
The informant drew up the plain paper F.I.R. at the spot and
took up investigation and returned to the police station.
            On the arrival at the police station, on the basis of
such F.I.R., Baliguda P.S. Case No.90 of 2008 was registered on
07.09.2008 under section 20(b) of the N.D.P.S. Act against the
four appellants. The informant directed the A.S.I. Arpita Khatua

                                  7
(P.W.7) to take up investigation of the case and he kept the four
appellants in the police station lock up.
            P.W.7 Arpita Khatua after taking over charge of
investigation from P.W.8, examined the informant so also the
other witnesses. She visited the spot at 5.45 p.m. and forwarded
the appellants to the Court on 08.09.2008. She produced the
seized articles along with the sample packets in the Court on
09.09.2008 and made a prayer to forward the samples to the
S.F.S.L., Bhubaneswar for chemical examination which was
allowed. She kept the seized ganja packets in the Court
Malkhana as per the orders of the Court and took the sample
packets for sending those for chemical examination. Since there
was law and order situation prevailing in the district, the sample
packets were kept in police station Malkhana and on 12.09.2008
after  normalcy    was    returned,   the sample    packets   were
dispatched to S.F.S.L., Bhubaneswar through constable for
chemical analysis. On 24.12.2008 the Inspector in Charge of
Balliguda police station took over charge of investigation from
P.W.7 and after completion of investigation, charge sheet was
submitted on 05.01.2009 under section 20(b) of the N.D.P.S.
Act.

                                   8
3.          The defence plea is one of denial and it is specifically
pleaded that no contraband ganja was seized from their
possession and they have been falsely implicated in the case.
4.          In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined
ten witnesses.

5.          The learned trial Court while assessing the evidence
on record has come to a finding that the two independent seizure
witnesses are deposing falsehood either to save the accused

                                  11
persons being gained over by them, as suggested by the learned
Public Prosecutor during cross-examination or for any other
reason best known to them. It was further held that the evidence
of P.W.9, the Executive        Magistrate fully   corroborates   the
evidence of the detecting police officer and in absence of any
specific material on record to the contrary, it cannot be lightly
discarded and outright thrown to the dust merely on the ground
that he is an official witness. The learned trial Court further held
that on a careful scrutiny of the entire evidence of P.Ws.8 and 9,
it appears be quite flawless and trustworthy and also it does not
suffer from any sort of infirmity in any manner and therefore, it
can be safely relied upon. It was further held that all the
appellants are the residents of same village of Chhatisgarh and
they were travelling together in the same vehicle having
registration number of their own State when detained near the
police checking barriers during communal rioting period and
therefore, the plea advanced on behalf of the lady accused
persons that they found the vehicle going towards Bolangir and
travelled in it on request due to communication problem cannot
be believed. The learned trial Court further held that the
contraband articles were seized from out of the exclusive and
conscious possession of all the four appellants travelling together

                                 12
in the said vehicle and as such they are all liable for the same.
The learned trial Court further held that the submission of the
defence counsel that the search in question having not been
made by any lady police officer in view of the provision under
section 50(4) of the N.D.P.S. Act, is illegal and entitles the lady
accused persons to an acquittal does not appear to have got any
force. It was further held that since a public conveyance is
searched in a public place in between sunrise to sunsent, the
officer making the search is not required to record the
satisfaction as contemplated by the provision of section 42 of the
N.D.P.S. Act for searching the vehicle and the proviso of section
42 is not applicable, hence the question of non-compliance of
provision of section 42 is wholly irrelevant. It was further held
that in view of the report of R.T.O., Durg, the registration
number displayed in the vehicle during the time of detection of
the case is a fake one. It was further held that though due to
communication problem on account of communal rioting, the
exhibits could not be taken to Bhubaneswar to hand it over at
the S.F.S.L. on the same day and there was three days delay in
it but in view of the fact mentioned in the chemical examination
report about tallying of specimen impression seal with that of the
card board box containing samples packets, the question of

                                  13
manipulation/tampering does not arise at all. The learned trial
Court further found that there was no irregularity or illegality in
keeping of the seized contraband articles under custody and thus
there has been no violation of the provision of section 55 of the
N.D.P.S. Act. It was further held that since the total quantity of
the cannabis recovered from out of possession of the appellants
is 196 kgs. which being commercial quantity of ganja, the
accused persons are liable to be punished under section
20(b)(ii)(C) of the N.D.P.S. Act.
6.          Mr. Anirudha Das, learned counsel appearing for
appellants Smt. Pyari Bag, Smt. Putana Kumbhar and Kamalesh
Mandal contended that the charge is defective, the evidence
relating to safe custody of the sample packets before its
production in Court as well as before the chemical examiner is
doubtful and there was every chance of tampering with the
contraband articles and mandatory provisions under the N.D.P.S.
Act have not been complied with and the investigation has been
conducted in a perfunctory manner and therefore, it is a fit case
where benefit of doubt should be extended in favour of the
appellants.
            Mr. Biraja Prasanna Das, Advocate appearing for the
appellant E.Srinivas adopted the arguments advanced by Mr.

                                   14
Anirudha Das and contended that on the face of the materials
available on record, the learned trial Court has committed
illegality in convicting the appellants under section 20(b)(ii)(C) of
the N.D.P.S. Act.
              Mr. Prem Kumar Pattnaik, learned         Addl. Govt.
Advocate on the other hand supported the impugned judgment
and submitted that even though the independent witnesses have
not supported the prosecution case but the version of the official
witnesses are clear, cogent and trustworthy and they have no
axe to grind against the appellants to falsely entangle them in a
case of this nature. It is further contended that the seizure was
done in the presence of an Executive Magistrate and the articles
were seized, sealed and it was properly stored in the police
Malkhana before its production in Court and as per the order of
the Court, it was also produced before the chemical examiner in
sealed condition and therefore, the hypothetical argument that
there was every chance of tampering with the seized articles
cannot be accepted. The learned counsel further submitted that
the mandatory provisions under the N.D.P.S. Act have been duly
complied with and even the other provisions which are directory
in nature, there was substantial compliance of the said provisions

                                 15
and there is no infirmity or illegality in the impugned judgment
and therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.
7.          Coming to the first contention raised by the learned
counsel for the appellants that the order of framing charge under
section 20(b) of the N.D.P.S. Act is defective, it is found that the
learned trial Court has mentioned in the charge that the
appellants were found in transporting 196 kgs. of ganja. The
date, time and place of seizure of ganja and the contravention
provision has also been indicated. It is no doubt true that such
quantity is punishable under section 20(b)(ii)(C) of the N.D.P.S.
Act and the learned trial Court has simply mentioned in the
charge to be one under section 20(b) of the N.D.P.S. Act but
section 464 of the Cr.P.C. states that no finding sentence or
order by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed to be
invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on
the ground of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge
including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in the opinion of the
Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has
in fact been occasioned thereby.
            The learned counsel for the appellants placed reliance
on the decision of this Court in case of Mayadhar Swain -Vrs.-
State of Orissa reported in (2000) 19 Orissa Criminal

                                     16
Reports 458, wherein the learned Special Judge framed charge
against the accused persons under section 20(b) of the N.D.P.S.
Act without specifying whether the offence was under sub-clause
(i) or sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of section 20 and this Court
held as follows:-
            “5.........It is evident from the aforesaid provision
             that for illegal possession of Ganja, charge
             should have been framed under section 20(b)(i)
             of the Act which is punishable with rigorous
             imprisonment for a term which may extend to
             five years and also fine which may extend to
             fifty thousand rupees. Section 20(b)(ii) provides
             for contravention relating to cannabis other than
             Ganja     which     is  punishable   with   rigorous
             imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
             than ten years, but may extend to twenty years
             and with fine which shall not be less than one
             lakh rupees and may extend to two lakh rupees.
             So the charge framed against the accused
             persons      in  the   present  case   is  evidently
             defective and has occasioned failure of justice.”
             Learned counsel for the appellants further placed
reliance in the cases of Sukadev Samantray -Vrs.- State of
Orissa reported in 2000 (II) Orissa Law Reviews 487 and
Salim Khan -Vrs.- State of Orissa reported in (2000) 19

                                  17
Orissa Criminal Reports 48 in which similar view has been
taken.
             In this case when at the time of framing of charge,
the date, time and place of seizure, the quantity of ganja seized
as well as specific contravention of the provision of the N.D.P.S.
Act has been put to the appellants and the charge was read over
and explained to them and they pleaded not guilty and claimed
to be tried, merely on the ground of omission of specific offence
under section 20(b)(ii)(C) and by mentioning section 20(b) in
the order of framing of charge, in my humble view cannot be
said to have caused a failure of justice even if it can be said to
be an irregularity in the framing of charge.
             The trial Court dealing with such matter while
framing charge is expected to be more careful by mentioning the
particular offence for which an accused has to face the trial
inasmuch as for different quantities of cannabis, different sub-
clauses of section 20(b)(ii) are applicable which prescribes
different  punishment     and   the  specific offence   should  be
mentioned in the order of framing charge.
             However, in the facts scenario and after going
through contents of the charge framed, since I am of the view
that the irregularity in the framing of charge has not caused any

                                   18
prejudice to the appellants resulting in failure of justice and in
fact it appears that the appellants were aware that they are to
defend themselves against the accusation of possession of
commercial quantity of contraband ganja, therefore, I am of the
view that the contention raised by the learned counsel for the
appellants that the order of conviction is vitiated for non-framing
of the specific charge under section 20(b)(ii)(C) N.D.P.S. Act is
not acceptable.
8.            Even though independent witnesses like P.W.1,
P.W.2 and P.W.4 have not supported the prosecution case which
is a usual feature in a case of this nature but the same cannot be
a ground to discard the entire prosecution case if on the basis of
the evidence of the official witnesses, this Court comes to a
finding that the accusation which has been leveled against the
appellants has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
             Now, it is to be seen as to how far the evidence of
the official witnesses are reliable and acceptable and whether the
evidence relating to the search and seizure as well as keeping of
the samples of contraband ganja in safe custody before its
arrival with the S.F.S.L. authorities and absence of any chance of
tampering with the same has been proved by the prosecution.

                                19
            Law is well settled that it is the duty of the
prosecution to see that the contraband articles which reached
the chemical examiner were the very articles which were seized
at the spot from the possession of the accused persons. The
entire path right from the point of seizure till its arrival with the
chemical examiner has to be travelled by adducing cogent,
reliable and trustworthy evidence and if any suspicion arises that
there is chance of tampering with the contraband articles then
benefit of doubt should be extended in favour of the accused
persons.
            The informant (P.W.8) has stated that when he
detected the Tata Sumo vehicle bearing registration no.CG 04 H
1204 was coming from the side of Dandapadar village towards
Baliguda side, he detained the vehicle and found the appellants
present therein. He also found air bags inside the vehicle and
smell of ganja was emitting from the bags. The informant has
stated that he sent intimation to the Executive Magistrate and
also sent the report to his superior i.e. S.P., Phulbani relating to
detection of ganja from the appellants and he proved such report
as Ext.38. He has further stated that in the presence of the
Executive Magistrate (P.W.9), the ganja was weighed with the
help of the weighman (P.W.4) and sample packets were drawn

                                 20
and seizure lists were prepared. Therefore, as per the evidence
of the informant, Ext.38 was prepared at a stage when neither
the weighments of contraband ganja were taken nor any sample
was drawn or any seizure lists was prepared.
            Most peculiarly on a perusal of Ext.38, it indicates
not only about the weighment of the contraband ganja, drawing
of the samples but also dispatch of the sample to the Court for
chemical analysis. Therefore, it is obvious that the oral evidence
adduced by the informant relating to the stage of preparation of
Ext.38 runs contrary to the contents/averments made in Ext.38.
            The informant (P.W.8) stated that he released the
personal brass seal in the zima of Banamali Behera (P.W.1)
under    zimanama     Ext.3/2.   P.W.1   Banamali    Behera    has
categorically stated that the police has not given him any brass
seal in the zima. The purpose of handing over the brass seal to
an independent person is that when the bulk packets/sample
packets in sealed condition are produced before the Court, the
person who had taken the zima of the brass seal should also
produce the same before the concerned Court for verification by
the Court as to whether the seal impressions which have been
fixed on the packets tally with the brass seal which was handed
over to the independent and reliable person or not. If the brass

                                  21
seal is not produced before the Court for verification and it
remains with the person who has effected search and seizure
then there is possibility of tampering with the seized articles.
Similarly if the brass seal is not produced before the Court then
handing it over to the independent and reliable person is
meaningless and it will serve no purpose at all. In the present
case, the order sheet of the Court does not indicate that when
the sample packets and the seized ganja were produced, the
brass seal was also produced and it was verified by the Court.
             The search and seizure according to the prosecution
was made on 07.09.2008. It is the prosecution case that it was
kept in police malkhana on that day i.e. on 07.09.2008. The
appellants were forwarded to the Court on 08.09.2008 and the
learned S.D.J.M., Baliguda directed the accused persons to be
produced before the learned Special Judge -cum- Sessions
Judge, Phulbani and sent the case records to the said Court. The
order sheet dated 08.09.2008 of the learned S.D.J.M., Balliguda
is silent regarding production of the seized ganja as well as
sample packets in Court on that day. There was no earthly
reason not to produce the seized ganja as well as sample
packets on 08.09.2008 when the appellants were produced
before the Court. It is not only the duty of the investigating

                                  22
agency to keep the seized contraband articles and sample
packets in safe custody before its arrival in Court but also to see
that it is produced in the Court at an earliest.
              The order sheet dated 09.09.2008 indicates that the
case record was placed before the learned Special Judge and the
Officer in charge of Baliguda police station submitted F.I.R.,
seizure list and 161 Cr.P.C. statement and prayed for remand of
the appellants to jail custody and also to send the sample
exhibits to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh for chemical examination and to
keep the material objects in the Court Malkhana. The learned
Special Judge passed the order that the Malkhana clerk shall
receive the seized property i.e. ten sealed bags of ganja and one
sample part from each bag in the Malkhana and it was further
directed that the other sample part from each bag is to be sent
to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh for chemical examination. Since the
Special Judge had no time on that day, he directed the records
to be put up before the learned S.D.J.M., Phulbani for sending
the sample packets to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh and the appellants
were remanded to jail custody. On the very day i.e. 09.09.2008
the sample packets were produced before the learned S.D.J.M.,
Phulbani and the order sheet indicates that ten sample packets
were sealed in one packet in the presence of the Magistrate and

                                  23
were handed over to the investigating officer for sending the
same to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh for chemical examination. The
forwarding report of the samples packets vide Ext.40 indicates
that the extract of the sample exhibits were drawn in polythene
pouches separately, kept in paper envelops and sealed and were
sent   through   special   messenger   for examination   and   the
specimen sample seal impression with which the exhibits were
sealed was sent also therewith for comparison. The learned
S.D.J.M., Phulbani has put his signature and date to be
09.09.2008. Therefore, on the one hand when the forwarding
report (Ext.40) indicates that the sample exhibits were sent to
the chemical examiner through special messenger, the order
sheet dated 09.09.2008 of the learned S.D.J.M., Phulbani
indicates that the sample packets were handed over to the
investigating officer for sending the same to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh.
The investigating officer (P.W.7) has stated that on 09.09.2008
she produced the seized articles along with sample packets
before the Court and made a prayer for forwarding the samples
to S.F.S.L., Bhubaneswar for chemical examination and the
seized packets were kept in Malkhana of the Court and the
sample packets were kept in safe custody in police station
Malkhana as there was law and order situation in the district and

                                 24
on 12.09.2008 after normalcy returned and transportation was
restored, the sample packets were sent to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh,
Bhubaneswar through police constable no.245 Manoj Kumar
Nayak.
            Therefore, the narration which has been made in the
forwarding report vide Ext.40 regarding sending the sample
packets through special messenger runs contrary to the order
sheet of the Court dated 09.09.2008 as well the evidence of the
investigating officer (P.W.7). Even though P.W.7 has stated that
the   sample    packets   were   sent   to  S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh,
Bhubaneswar on 12.09.2008 but the chemical examination
report which has been marked as Ext.67 indicates that the parcel
was received in the office on 15.09.2008 i.e. about three days
after it was dispatched through constable Manoj Kumar Nayak.
The said Manoj Kumar Nayak has not been examined in this
case. The Malkhana register which has been exhibited in the case
as Ext.54 does not indicate that after the Court handed over the
sample packets in sealed cover, it was kept in the malkhana till
12.09.2008 as stated by the Investigating Officer. The Malkhana
register entry only indicates about the arrival of the sample
packets   and   seized   ganja  on  07.09.2008.   Therefore, the
prosecution case that the sample packets and the seized ganja

                                25
were kept in safe custody in police malkhana is doubtful. When
the material witness like constable Manoj Kumar Nayak has not
been examined and the Malkhana register does not indicate any
entry of the sample packets on 09.09.2008 and the prosecution
has not adduced any reliable evidence as to why there was three
days more delay after the samples were handed over to the
police constable Manoj Kumar Nayak to be produced before
S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar, the entire thing is shrouded
in mystery.
            The forwarding report (Ext.40) of the sample packets
for chemical analysis indicates that the sample exhibits were
drawn in polythene pouches separately and then it was kept in
paper envelopes and sealed. The order sheet of the learned
S.D.J.M., Balliguda dated 09.09.2008 indicates that the 10
sample packets were kept in one packet and it was sealed and
handed over to the investigating officer whereas the chemical
examiner’s report indicates that the parcel consisted of a
cardboard box which was enclosed within cloth cover and sealed
with the impression of the seal corresponding to the seal
impression forwarded and the ganja were kept in cellophane
packet. Therefore, the paper envelopes in which the polythene
pouches were kept as per the forwarding report were not there

                                   26
as per the chemical examiner’s report which creates doubt as to
whether the packet which was sent from the Court by the
Magistrate    reached   in   safe  condition  before the  chemical
examiner. Not only the inordinate delay in dispatch of the
samples to the chemical examiner is suspicious but also the
other surrounding circumstances create reasonable doubt that
there was every possibility of tampering with the sample packets
before its arrival at the S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh, Bhubanswar.
             P.W.8 though stated that he sent his report of
detection    of   ganja    from   the  accused    persons  to   the
Superintendent of Police, Phulbani vide Ext.38 on 09.09.2008 but
on a plain reading of the said exhibit, it appears to be a detailed
report regarding the detection of ganja on 07.09.2008 and action
taken thereof till that date which is probably prepared in
compliance of the provision under section 57 of the N.D.P.S. Act.
In the said letter of the IIC, Balliguda police station, it is
mentioned in the concluding paragraph that “ten sample packets
of ganja has also been sent to S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar
through Special Judge, Phulbani for examination and opinion”. If
according to the prospection case, ten sample packets of ganja
were   sent    to  S.F.S.L.,   Rasulgarh,   Bhubaneswar   only   on
12.09.2008, therefore, mentioning of such fact in Ext.38 which is

                                  27
dated 09.09.2008 clearly indicates that Ext.38 was not prepared
on the date on which it is shown to have been prepared or in
other words, it is an ante-dated document. It seems to have
been prepared either on 12.09.2008 or thereafter and the date
which has been mentioned under the signature of I.I.C. of
Baliguda police station is not the correct date when the signature
was put.
             Section 57 of the N.D.P.S. Act states that whenever
any person makes any arrest or seizure under the Act, he shall,
within forty eight hours next after such arrest or seizure, make a
full report of all the particulars of such arrest or seizure to his
immediate official superior.
             In this case according to the prosecution, the search
and seizure was effected in a public place that to on 07.09.2008.
Therefore, in compliance of section 57 of the N.D.P.S. Act, the
report should have been dispatched by the informant who was
the I.I.C. of Baliguda police station by 09.09.2008 but as I have
already held that the detailed report (Ext.38) was not sent to the
S.P., Kandhamal on 09.09.2008 but it was sent either on
12.09.2008 or subsequent to that and it has been ante-dated
just to keep it at par with the provision under section 57 of the
N.D.P.S. Act, I am of the view that the document has been

                                   28
fabricated to show the compliance of relevant provision of the
N.D.P.S. Act which makes the conduct of the Inspector in
Charge, Balliguda police station more suspicious.
            Learned counsel for the State placed reliance on the
decision of Sajan Abraham -Vrs.- State of Kerala reported
in A.I.R. 2001 Supreme Court 3190, wherein his lordship
while discussing the provision under section 57 of the N.D.P.S.
Act has held as follows:-
            “12. The last submission for the appellant is,
            there is non-compliance of section 57 of the Act.
            He submits under it, an obligation is cast on the
            prosecution while making an arrest or seizure,
            the   officer   should   make   full report of  all
            particulars of such arrest or seizure and send it
            to his immediate superior officer within 48 hours
            of such arrest of seizure. The submission is, this
            has not been done. Hence the entire case
            vitiates. It is true that the communication to the
            immediate superior has not been made in the
            form of a report, but we find, which is also
            recorded by the High Court that P.W.5 has sent
            copies of FIR and other documents to his
            superior officer which is not in dispute. Ex. P9
            shows that the copies of the FIR along with
            other records regarding the arrest of appellant
            and seizure of the contraband articles were sent
            by P.W.5 to his superior officer immediately

                                29
          after registering the said case. So, all the
          necessary information to be submitted in a
          report was sent. This constitutes substantial
          compliance and mere absence of any such
          report cannot be said it has prejudiced the
          accused. This section is not         mandatory    in
          nature. When substantial compliance has been
          made, as in the present case, it would not
          vitiate the prosecution case. In the present
          case, we find P.W.5 has sent all the relevant
          material to his superior officer immediately.
          Thus we do not find any violation of section 57
          of the Act.”
          In case of Sukhdev Singh -Vrs.- State of Haryana
reported in A.I.R. 2013 Supreme Court 953, it is held as
follows:-
          “23. Once the contraband is recovered, then
          there are other provisions like section 57 which
          the empowered officer is mandatorily required to
          comply with. That itself to some extent would
          minimize    the   purpose   and   effectiveness  of
          section 42 of the NDPS Act. It is to provide
          fairness   in   the   process  of   recovery    and
          investigation which is one of the basic features
          of our criminal jurisprudence. It is a kind of
          prevention    of  false  implication   of  innocent
          persons. The legislature in its wisdom had made
          the provisions of section 42 of NDPS Act

                                  30
             mandatory and not optional as stated by this
             Court in the case of Karnail Singh (supra).”
             In case of Gurbax Singh -Vrs.- State of Haryana
reported in 2001 Supreme Court Cases (Criminal) 426, it is
held as follows:-
             “9……Further, it is apparent that the I.O. has not
             followed the procedure prescribed under section
             57 of the N.D.P.S. Act of making full report of all
             particulars  of   arrest   and   seizure  to   his
             immediate    superior  officer. The   conduct   of
             panch witness is unusual as he offered himself
             to be a witness for search and seizure despite
             being not asked by the I.O., particularly when
             he did not know that the substance was poppy
             husk, but came to know about it only after being
             informed by the police. Further, it is the say of
             the Panch witness that Muddamal seal used by
             the PSI was a wooden seal. As against this, it is
             the say of P.W.2 SI/IO that it was a brass seal.
             On the basis of the aforesaid evidence and faulty
             investigation by the prosecution, in our view, it
             would not be safe to convict the appellant for a
             serious offence of possessing poppy husk.”
             In case of Bahadur Singh -Vrs.- State of Haryana
reported in (2010) 4 Supreme Court Cases 445, it has been
held as follows:-

                                    31
             “20. As far as compliance with the provisions of
             section 57 of the NDPS Act is concerned, as has
             been indicated earlier, it has been held by this
             Court that the same was not mandatory, and, in
             any event, information of the arrest of the
             petitioner and seizure of the contraband had
             been duly reported to the local police station on
             the basis of which the first information report
             had been drawn up.”
             In case of Kishan Chand -Vrs.- State of Haryana
reported in (2013) 2 Supreme Court Cases 502, it has been
held as follows:-
             “24. Reliance placed by the learned counsel
             appearing for the State on Sajan Abraham is
             entirely    misplaced,   firstly  in  view   of   the
             Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in
             Karnail Singh. Secondly, in that case the Court
             was also dealing with the application of the
             provisions of section 57 of the Act which are
             worded       differently    and     have    different
             requirements, as opposed to sections 42 and 50
             of the Act. It is not a case where any reason has
             come     in  evidence    as    to  why   the   secret
             information was not reduced to writing and sent
             to the higher officer, which is the requirement to
             be adhered to “pre-search”. The question of
             sending it immediately thereafter does not arise
             in the present case, as it is an admitted position

                                   32
              that there is total non-compliance of section 42
              of the Act. The sending of report as required
              under section 57 of the Act on 20.07.2000 will
              be no compliance, factually and/or in the eyes of
              law to the provisions of section 42 of the Act.
              These   are   separate    rights  and    protections
              available to an accused and their compliance has
              to be done in accordance with the provisions of
              sections 42, 50 and 57 of the Act. They are
              neither interlinked nor interdependent so as to
              dispense compliance of one with the compliance
              of another. In fact, they operate in different
              fields and at different stages. That distinction
              has to be kept in mind by the courts while
              deciding such cases.”
              Therefore, even though section 57 of the N.D.P.S.
Act is not mandatory in nature but the investigating officer
cannot totally ignore such a provision which is directory in nature
as the same has got a salutary purpose. When an official witness
like I.I.C., Balliguda police station is trying to create a document
by making it ante-dated just to show the compliance of section
57 of N.D.P.S. Act and there are large scale loopholes and
potholes in the prosecution story then obviously the conduct of
the   investigating   agency    cannot    be said    to   be  fair and
aboveboard.       The  investigation   has   to  be    fair, judicious,
transparent and expeditious to ensure with basic compliance of

                                  33
law i.e. to find out as to where the truth lies. The investigation
has to be conducted in such a manner which would reflect that
every possible measure has been taken to find out the whole
truth and to decipher the truth from the web of falsehoods.
When the independent witnesses have not supported the
prosecution case and when the official witnesses are found not to
be reliable and trustworthy and the search and seizure of
contraband ganja and keeping the seized articles in safe custody
is not free from suspicion and the delayed dispatch of the
samples to the chemical examiner has not been satisfactorily
explained and the chance of tampering with the contraband
articles cannot be ruled out, I am of the humble view that it is a
fit case where the benefit of doubt should be extended in favour
of the appellants.
9.           Accordingly, the impugned judgment and order of
conviction of the appellants under section 20(b)(ii)(C) of the
N.D.P.S. Act and the sentence passed thereunder is set aside.
             It is stated at the Bar that the appellants Smt. Pyari
Bag in CRLA No.566 of 2010 and Smt. Putana Kumbhar in CRLA
No.607 of 2010 are on bail. They are discharged from liability of
their bail bond. Their personal and surety bonds stand cancelled.

                                             34
                 The appellant E. Srinibas in CRLA No.591 of 2010
and Kamalesh Mandal in JCRLA No.11 of 2012 who are in judicial
custody shall be set at liberty forthwith, if their detention is not
otherwise required in any other case.
                 Accordingly, all the criminal appeals are allowed.
                                                     ...…………………………
