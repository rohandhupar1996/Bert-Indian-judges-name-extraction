PRESENT :
                         THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE D.DASH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of hearing : 21.07.2015                      :        Date of judgment: 04.08.2015
                  The unsuccessful opposite party has called in question
the judgment dated 20.12.2008 passed by the learned District Judge,
Keonjhar in guardianship petition no. 10 of 2007 declaring the
respondent to be the guardian of the person of minor girl child,
Bhagyalaxmi Barik, then aged about 2 years and five months.
                  2.       Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Perused
the impugned judgment.

                                  -2-
             3.    The respondent as the petitioner filed a petition for
appointment of guardian of minor Bhagyalaxmi Barik who happens to
be the daughter of Monalisha Barik, the deceased daughter of the
respondent. The appellant is the father of the Bhagyalaxmi. It is
stated that she was born on 12.03.2005 and since then she has been
brought up in the house of respondent who is the maternal
grandfather. It is the further case that mother of Bhagyalaxmi after
the marriage was not treated properly in the in-laws place and was
tortured for which she was brought by the respondent and was
treated. During then, Bhagyalaxmi was born. Though for the purpose
of ‘Namakaran’, Monalisha and Bhagyalaxmi were left in the house of
the appellant, then also tortured upon Monalisha didn’t come to an
end and rather it was further mounted upon causing severe mental
tension. On 01.09.2005, Monalisha died leaving the newly born
daughter, Bhagyalaxmi. And ultimately she died on 01.09.2005. The
respondent thereafter has been maintaining the child keeping her
with him and in the meantime it is stated that appellant had married
another woman and living together. An attempt being made by the
appellant to take the girl child by filing an application in the court of
Sub-Collector, Pallahada by way of issuance of search warrant,
however, the same did not ultimately succeed. It is further stated that
Bhagyalaxmi is being maintained properly and provided with all other

                                   -3-
facilities and the appellant is not providing even any sort of financial
or other help.
              The   appellant  resisted  the  claim  stating  that  the
respondent took Monalisha and Bhagyalaxmi forcibly and there was
never any torture upon Monalisha. It is stated that Monalisha was a
chronic patient and because of negligence of her father in giving
proper treatment, she ultimately died. The appellant claims to be all
along ready and willing to maintain his minor daughter Bhagyalaxmi
properly. Therefore, he opposes the prayer of respondent for
appointment of guardian of Bhagyalaxmi.
        4.    The parties have led evidence in support of their
respective case. The learned District Judge keeping in view the settled
principle of law that in such matters welfare of the child is the
paramount consideration to be considered looking at the age of the
child, atmosphere in which he/ she would be living and all other
surrounding circumstance as well as future of the child so that
ultimately he / she stands as a responsible member of the society,
having analysed the evidence on record has appointed the respondent
to be the guardian of the person of the minor female child
Bhagyalaxmi. This is now being assailed in this appeal.
        5.    It is the settled position of law that in the matter of
appointment of guardian of the minor in respect of the person, the
Court has to always look to the welfare of the minor and that is the

                                   -4-
paramount consideration. In such matter of appointment of guardian,
the court in view of the competing claims is under legal obligation
probably being placed in the position of a superior guardian under
the special legislation to consider as to in whose hands the welfare of
the minor would be best served.
       6.    For the purpose of judging the defensibility of the said
order of appointment of guardian of Bhagyalaxmi, let me begin the
exercise in having a critical look at the evidence on record, viewing
the facts and other circumstances including the conduct of the
parties althrough to decide the fate of rival prayers.
       However, before going to take up the said exercise, some
admitted factual aspects are felt necessary to be highlighted side by
side. The girl child Bhagyalaxmi has been staying with the respondent
almost since her birth. She has never stayed with the appellant after
the death of her mother, Monalisha. By now the girl child is aged
about 7 ½ years. The evidence is coming from the lips of the P.W. 2
and 3 that Bhagyalaxmi’s mother Monalisha was tortured in the
house of her in-laws. The appellant has married second time after
death of Monalisha. Be that as it may, the fact remains that she had
stayed most of the time since marriage with her parents in their
house. The financial capacity of the respondent is well established as
it is seen from evidence that he has the capacity to spend the
required money for upbringing of girl child in proper manner rather in

                                   -5-
a better status than what the respondent is enjoying. The girl child
for all the period has remained quite comfortable in the company of
the respondent and his family members. So far as the facility for
education, health and other aspects are concerned, the place of stay
of the respondent appears to be quite alright and suitable. The trial
court had taken the pain of calling the girl child and interacting with
her. During then, she had aired her desire to stay with the
respondent. This exercise was taken up shortly before the delivery of
the judgment. No such infirmity with the respondent has been stated
in evidence so as to dis-entitle him for such appointment. On analysis
of evidence, the trial court has found the respondent to be staying in
a better place and having better living with the capability of
shouldering the responsibility as the guardian. The view taken is that
the child would get proper atmosphere to grow and pursue her
studies by remaining with the respondent and his family members
who have been bestowing their love, care and affection all through
with which the child is also happy.
             The appellant has not led any evidence to show that
under the hands of the respondent, the interest of the girl child and
her welfare would not be safeguarded or would suffer. Even till now
no such allegation has come from the side of the appellant against the
respondent that he has acted in any way detrimental to the interest of
the minor or that there has been any change in the situation or

                                     -6-
surroundings in the meantime. The appellant has further not piloted
any evidence showing any such instances wherefrom the conduct of
the respondent can either be said or inferred to be adverse to the
minor or tending to injure the interest of the minor. The wish of the
minor to so reside remains. The appellant being the father has not
exhibited any concern for his minor daughter as yet in any matter. He
having abandoned his duties and responsibilities thus cannot be
constituent to the welbeing of the child. Thus this Court is led to hold
the respondent to be the fittest person to act as guardian of
Bhagyalaxmi while concluding that in his hands only the minors
welfare would be best taken care of and served.
         In view of aforesaid discussion this Court finds the judgment of
the learned District Judge to be well in order and thus the same does
not call for interference.
         7.      Accordingly, the appeal stands dismissed. No order as to
costs.
