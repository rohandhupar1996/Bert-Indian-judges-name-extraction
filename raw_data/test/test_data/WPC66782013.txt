                                      BEFORE
                     HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE UJJAL BHUYAN
31.08.2015
            Heard Mr. IH Saikia, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. SK
Medhi, learned Central Govt. Counsel for the respondents.
            By filing this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
petitioner seeks quashing of adverse remarks recorded in his Annual Confidential
Reports (ACRs) for the following periods: -
            i) 01.04.2006 to 31.03.2007
            ii) 01.04.2007 to 28.11.2007 and
            iii) 29.11.2007 to 31.03.2008
and further seeks quashing of order dated 27.07.2011, issued by respondent
No.2 rejecting the representation of the petitioner for upgradation of the
gradings in the ACRs. Petitioner also seeks a direction to the respondents to
grant him Non-Functional Section Grade (NFSG) at the grade pay of Rs.7,600.00
per month w.e.f. 27.06.2010 and Non-Functional Upgradation (NFU) at the grade
pay of Rs.8,700.00 per month w.e.f. 01.07.2011.
            Case of the petitioner is that he had joined as Assistant Executive
Engineer (E&M) in the Border Roads Organization (BRO) on 03.04.1996. He was
promoted to the post of Executive Engineer (E&M) on 27.06.2005. According to
the petitioner, because of his meritorious service, he was given foreign posting of
two years, besides being awarded commendation certificates and medals by the
Govt. of India.
            NFSG at grade pay of Rs.7,600.00 per month became due to the
petitioner w.e.f. 27.06.2010 and the NFU at the grade pay of Rs.8,700.00 per
month was due to him w.e.f. 01.07.2011 as those benefits were granted to his
batch mates with effect from the aforesaid dates. It is stated that for conferment
of such benefit, the bench mark in the gradings recorded in the ACRs for the
preceding 5 years should be “Very Good”.
            Contention of the petitioner is that for the aforesaid three periods, he
received final gradings of “Good”, “Average” and “Good” respectively. For the
period from 01.04.2006 to 31.03.2007, the Initiating Officer had graded the
petitioner as “Outstanding”, which was downgraded to “Very Good” by the
WPC No.6678/2013                                                     Page 1 of 8

Technical Officer and further downgraded to “Good” at the level of Reviewing
Officer and Accepting Officer. For the period from 01.04.2007 to 28.11.2007, the
Initiating Officer graded him “Very Good”, which was maintained by the
Technical Officer. However, the Reviewing Officer downgraded him to “Average”.
For this period, the Reviewing Officer was also the Accepting Officer.
             For the period from 29.11.2007 to 31.03.2008, the initial grading
“Very Good” was maintained by the Technical Officer, but was downgraded to
“Average” by the Reviewing Officer. However, at the level of Accepting Officer,
petitioner was graded “Good”.
            Petitioner came to know about the aforesaid adverse entries in the
ACRs only when those were communicated to him vide letter dated 25.10.2010.
Immediately after receipt of the impugned ACRs, petitioner submitted
representation dated 26.11.2010 before the competent authority for upgradation
of the gradings to the bench mark level of “Very Good” by expunging the adverse
entries. However, representation of the petitioner was rejected vide order dated
27.07.2011 by a cryptic order. Petitioner was informed that his prayer for
upgradation of the gradings was duly considered, but nothing exemplary was
found in his performance during the period under consideration and hence his
representation for upgradation of his ACRs was rejected by the competent
authority.
            Aggrieved, present writ petition has been filed seeking the relief as
indicated above.
            Contention of the petitioner is that his case was considered by the
Screening Committee by taking into account the adverse entries recorded in his
ACRs, which were not communicated to him. The ACRs were communicated to
the petitioner very belatedly and when represented against the same, it was
rejected without any proper consideration. The procedure followed in grading
him in his ACRs by the respective authorities was not inconformity with the
applicable guidelines. On merit also, it is contended that assessment of the
petitioner was not proper and he could not have been graded below the bench
mark.
            Respondents in their affidavit have contended that prior to the Office
Memorandum of the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), Govt. of
WPC No.6678/2013                                                   Page 2 of 8

India, dated 13.04.2010, there were no instructions for communication of ACR
entries to the concerned Government servant. It was in compliance to the OM
dated 13.04.2010 that the ACR gradings, which were below the bench mark for
the period under consideration, were communicated to the petitioner on
25.10.2010. It is contended that petitioner was properly assessed and the
gradings given reflected his performance for the period under consideration. It is
stated that the grading “Good” is not adverse. There were no provisions for
communication of “Good” grading to the petitioner at the relevant point of time.
It is admitted that petitioner was eligible for consideration for grant of NFU w.e.f.
01.07.2011. His name was considered by the Screening Committee upto the year
2013-2014. The Screening Committee had finally assessed him fit for grant of
NFU with grade pay of Rs.8,700.00 w.e.f. 01.04.2013. Order in this regard was
issued on 11.04.2014. With regard to NFSG with grade pay of Rs.8,700.00, it is
stated that petitioner became eligible for such consideration w.e.f. 01.04.2011,
which is under process.
             Thus from the above, it is evident that Screening Committee while
considering the case of the petitioner for conferment of aforesaid financial
benefits w.e.f. 27.06.2010 and 01.07.2011 had considered the aforesaid
uncommunicated gradings of the petitioner, which were below the bench mark of
“Very Good”.
             The object of recording of ACRs have been succinctly gone into by
this Court in a recent decision in Bharat Singh Panwar Vs Union of India &
Ors., reported in (2013) 1 GLR 320. This Court has held that preparation and
maintenance of confidential report of a Government servant is a means to an end
and not an end in itself. Ultimate objective is to optimize the performance level of
the Government servant. This is possible only when the short-comings as well as
the good qualities of a Government servant are brought to his notice when
periodical assessments are made. The main focus of the Reporting Officer should
therefore be developmental rather than judgmental. This Court has held as
under:-
                “     8. As reflected in dossier of preparation and maintenance
                of confidential reports, the system of Confidential Reports on
                the performance of Government servants is a means to an end
WPC No.6678/2013                                                      Page 3 of 8

             and not an end in itself. The ultimate goal is to optimise the
             achievement of Government policies and programmes. This is
             possible only if the Confidential Reports lead to the optimisation
             of the performance of the concerned Government servants. The
             main focus of the Reporting officer should, therefore, be
             developmental rather than judgmental. A Confidential Report
             should be a true indicator of the achievement of the
             Government servant; it should not be a mere tool to control or
             discipline him.
                   9. The system of Confidential Reports has two principal
             objectives and the Reporting officer should have a very clear
             perception of these objectives. The first and foremost is to
             improve the performance of the subordinate in his present job.
             The second objective is to assess the potentialities of the
             subordinate and prepare him through appropriate feedback and
             guidance for future possible opportunities in service. To a great
             extent, the second objective is dependent on the achievement
             of the first.
                   10. It is the duty of the superior officer to give the
             subordinate a clear understanding of the tasks to be performed
             and to provide requisite resources for his performance. The
             subordinate is required to contribute to the best of his capacity
             to the qualitative and quantitative achievement of the given
             tasks making optimum use of the resources provided. Also,
             both the superior and his subordinate have to be necessarily
             aware of the ultimate goal of their organisation, which can be
             achieved only through the joint efforts of both of them. This is
             the basic philosophy underlying any system of Confidential
             Report.
                   11. The performance of every Government servant is
             assessed annually through his Confidential Report, which is an
             important document providing the basic and vital inputs for
             assessing the performance of the Government servant and for
WPC No.6678/2013                                                   Page 4 of 8

               assessing his suitability for his further advancement in his
               career on occasion like confirmation, promotion, crossing of
               E.B., selection for deputation, selection for foreign assignment
               etc. Performance appraisal through confidential reports is a tool
               for human resource development in order to enable a
               Government servant to realise his true potential. It is not a fault
               finding process, but a developmental one.
                      12. In Annexure-3 guidelines dated 12.04.2010, it has
               been provided that a very cautious approach is required while
               awarding the grading and that any grading below the bench
               mark is to be adequately justified by citing specific reasons.
               Whatever adverse entry is made, same should be substantiated
               by counselling letters/warning letters or other relevant
               documents. It is also provided that in case of any difference of
               opinion, reasons for the same are required to be recorded.
               Emphasising the responsibility of the Accepting Authority, it has
               been provided that the said authority has to ensure that all the
               ACRs are duly initiated/reviewed within time. It also provides
               that adequate counselling/advise should be provided to its
               subordinates whose ACRs are written for overcoming the
               deficiencies and shortcomings.”
            Therefore, the object is the improvement in the performance level of
the Government servant through yearly monitoring, guidance and counselling
where necessary. Further, the expression 'Confidential Report' is a misnomer
because there is nothing confidential about it. Infact, it has now developed into a
transparent procedure of assessment as would be seen from the succeeding
paragraphs with the objective of guiding and developing the performance of the
Government servant for optimum utilization of his potential.
            The law relating to recording of Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs)
has by now crystallized by a series of decisions of the Apex Court. The decision in
Dev Dutt (supra) can be said to be a significant milestone in the development of
this particular branch of service jurisprudence. The Apex Court has held that
WPC No.6678/2013                                                     Page 5 of 8

every entry, irrespective of whether it is poor, average, good, very good or
outstanding, should be communicated to the concerned Government servant
within a reasonable period. Explaining the rational behind such a proposition, the
Apex Court held that non-communication of such an entry may adversely affect
the employee in two ways: (1) if the entry is communicated to him, he would
know about the assessment of his work and conduct by his superiors, which
would enable him to improve his work in future; (2) he would have an
opportunity of making a representation against the entry if he feels it is
unjustified and can pray for its upgradation. Thus non-communication of an entry
in ACR is arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The
Apex Court further held that when the entry is communicated to the Government
servant he should have the right to make a representation against such entry.
Such representation should be decided by an authority higher than the one who
made the entry. The representation must be decided in a fair manner and within
a reasonable period. In the context of promotion, it was observed that non-
communication of entries in Annual Confidential Reports has civil consequences
and may affect the chances of a Government servant for promotion or for
availing other benefits.
            In Abhijit Ghosh Dastidar Vs Union of India, reported in (2009) 16
SCC 146, the Apex Court referred to the decision in Dev Dutt (supra) and held
that non-communication of entries in the Annual Confidential Reports of a public
servant has civil consequences as it may affect his chances of promotion or
getting other benefits. Uncommunicated entries should not be taken into
consideration for the purpose of consideration for promotion to the higher grade.
            Again in the case of Sukhdev Singh Vs Union of India and Ors.,
reported in (2013) 9 SCC 573, a larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
approved the decision in Dev Dutt (supra) and also referred to the subsequent
decision in Abhijit Ghosh Dastidar (supra). It was held as follows:
               “       In our opinion, the view taken in Dev Dutt (supra) that
               every entry in ACR of a public servant must be communicated
               to him/her within a reasonable period is legally sound and helps
               in achieving threefold objectives. First, the communication of
WPC No.6678/2013                                                    Page 6 of 8

               every entry in the ACR to a public servant helps him/her to
               work harder and achieve more that helps him in improving his
               work and give better results. Second and equally important, on
               being made aware of the entry in the ACR, the public servant
               may feel dissatisfied with the same. Communication of the
               entry enables him/her to make representation for upgradation
               of the remarks entered in the ACR. Third, communication of
               every entry in the ACR brings transparency in recording the
               remarks relating to a public servant and the system becomes
               more conforming to the principles of natural justice. We,
               accordingly, hold that every entry in ACR poor, fair, average,
               good or very good-must be communicated to him/her within a
               reasonable period.”
            At this stage, the decision in Dev Dutt (supra) may once again be
referred to. In the said decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that
communication of entries in the ACRs and giving opportunity to represent against
them is particularly important in higher posts which are in a pyramidical structure
where often the principle of elimination is followed in selection for promotion.
            In the light of the above, Court is of the view that the matter is
required to be remanded back for fresh consideration of the case of the
petitioner for grant of NFSG at the grade pay of Rs.7,600.00 per month w.e.f.
27.06.2010 and NFU at the grade pay of Rs.8,700.00 per month w.e.f.
01.07.2011 by the Screening Committee at par with his batch mates. The
gradings given in the above ACRs shall not be taken into account by the
Screening Committee, who may independently assess the suitability of the
petitioner consistently with the observations made above and in accordance with
law.
            Let the fresh exercise be carried out within a period of three (3)
months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order and whatever be
the outcome of the said exercise, the same should be communicated to the
petitioner.
WPC No.6678/2013                                                      Page 7 of 8

            It is made clear that if the petitioner’s claim is upheld by the
Screening Committee, he would be entitled to the consequential benefits.
Accordingly, the gradings recorded in the ACRs for the period -
            i) 01.04.2006 to 31.03.2007
            ii) 01.04.2007 to 28.11.2007 and
            iii) 29.11.2007 to 31.03.2008
are quashed and consequently, the impugned order dated 27.07.2011 is also
quashed.
            Writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated above, but without any
order as to costs.
                                                                     Judge
