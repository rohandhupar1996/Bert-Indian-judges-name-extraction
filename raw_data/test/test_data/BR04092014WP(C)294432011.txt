               THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH

             Date of hearing : 26.08.2014                        Date of Judgment : 04.09.2014
             ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biswanath Rath, J.             By filing the present writ petition, the petitioner has
             sought for issuance of a writ of mandamus quashing the impugned
             order under Annexure-9 of the writ petition. The facts involved in the
             writ as borne out from the writ petition as well as the submission of
             the petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed as a Field Man
             Demonstrator in the establishment of the opposite party. He claimed
             to have been discharging his duties with dutifulness and to the best

                                    2
satisfaction of his authority. He has not suffered during his entire
service career, while he was working as such on 09.07.2003 an office
order was issued by the opposite party no.1 placing the petitioner
under suspension indicating therein that he has been placed under
suspension on account of his detention in custody on 07.02.2003 and
the detention by exceeding 48 hours. He has been suspended from the
date of detention, i.e., 07.02.2003 in terms of Rule-12(2) of the Orissa
Civil Services (CCA) Rules, 1962 and under Statute 46 of the OUAT
Employee Detention of Service Statute, 1989 as appearing vide
Annexure-1.
2.           The petitioner further contended that consequent upon
the development a regular disciplinary proceeding was initiated
against him on 30.12.2003 following service of article of charges on
his alleged unauthorized absence from Headquarters and suppression
of factum of arrest as well as detention in jail custody and misconduct.
The petitioner submitted his reply on 26.01.2004 denying the
allegations made therein.
3.           In the meanwhile, the petitioner faced with a Criminal
Proceeding vide Nayagarh P.S. Case No.166 of 2002 and upon
completion of trial in connection with the aforesaid Criminal
Proceeding, the petitioner was convicted by the judgment of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Nayagarh in S.T. Case
Nos.174/101/107 of 2005/2004, S.T. Case Nos.175/102/204 of
2005/2004 and S.T. Case Nos.176/8/26 of 2005 convicting the
petitioner under Sections 302/120-B, I.P.C. and sentencing him to

                                      3
undergo R.I. for life with fine of Rs.5,000/-, and in default to undergo
R.I. for further period of six months.
              The petitioner challenged the above judgment in this
Court in Criminal Appeal No.38 of 2007 and this Court by judgment
dated 04.11.2009 passed in Criminal Appeal Nos.564 of 2006 and 38
of 2007 as appearing at Annexure-4, pleased to set aside the order of
conviction and sentences and acquitted petitioner and others entangled
in both appeals from the charges under Sections 302/120-B, I.P.C.
4.            Be it stated here that following his acquittal in the
Criminal Appeal by this Court vide Annexure-4, the University vide
officer order dated 26.02.2010 reinstated the petitioner into service
with effect from 17.11.2009 and posted the petitioner at the disposal
of Dean, College of Agriculture, Bhubaneswar pending finalization of
the Disciplinary Proceeding.
              It is the further case of the petitioner that being aggrieved
by the above office order, the petitioner submitted a representation
before the Registrar of the opposite party University for regularization
of his service and allowing him with all other consequential service
and financial benefits. The petitioner made a specific claim, claiming
his regularization of all the period of service with effect from
07.02.2003, the date on which the petitioner was placed under
suspension. He further submitted that in the meanwhile, the enquiry
proceeding also proceeded and the enquiry was closed with a single
sitting submitting a report thereby against the petitioner. Being
noticed to show-cause, the petitioner objected the enquiry proceeding
on the ground that he has not been given a chance in the enquiry,

                                    4
while the position stood thus the petitioner was served with an office
order dated 15.07.2011 referring therein to the decision of the Board
of Management by Resolution No.3703 dated 02.07.2011 treating the
period of suspension of the petitioner as “No work no Pay” and
disallowing any other service or pensionary benefit for the period
between 04.02.2003 to 25.02.2010 as appearing at Annexure-9.
5.            The petitioner assailed the above order of punishment in
this writ petition on the ground that the entire action of the opposite
party University in issuing the letter is dehors under OCS (CCA)
Rules, 1962 at OUAT Statute, 1989 as well as cannons of law, before
imposing major penalty, the petitioner alleged that he was not even
issued with a show-cause notice before the impugned action was
taken. The petitioner also assailed the impugned order for lack of
opportunity of hearing in the proceeding. While referring to Rule
91(2) and 93 of the Orissa Service Code (for short ‘the OSC’) Rules,
1962 the petitioner claimed that when he has been fully exonerated
from the charges based on which the impugned suspension order and
the disciplinary proceeding was initiated, he is entitled to all his back
wages along with treatment of no break in service.
6.            Per contra, the university on its appearance filed a
counter inter alia contending that the university had rightly placed him
under suspension for his unauthorized absence from service from
04.02.2003 to 05.02.2003 on the plea of his daughter’s marriage.
During that period, he was detained in custody in connection with
Nayagarh P.S. Case No.166 of 2002 and was detained in police

                                    5
custody up to 07.02.2003. Consequently his detention exceeded 48
hours, the university also claimed its action is valid in view of
provisions contained under Statute 46 of Orissa University
Agriculture and Technology Employees Conditions of Service Statute,
1989. Further its action being protected under Rule 12, 15 and 16 of
Orissa Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1962.
Further claim of the opposite parties is that the petitioner faced with a
disciplinary proceeding and the Enquiry Officer submitted a report on
17.08.2010 with specific recommendations, which is quoted herein
below:-
              “The arrest and confinement of the petitioner is a
              result of criminal case from which he has already
              been acquitted by the Hon’ble Court, Odisha, He
              spent more than 6 years in custody and definitely
              would have gone mental stress and financial loss.
              As explained, therefore, all the charges leveled
              against him may not be treated as deliberative or
              intentional,     rather      co-incidental       and
              circumstantial”
7.            The university contended that since the petitioner had
suffered more than 6 years in Jail custody it called for a clarification
from the Government regarding regularization of his service vide their
letter No.58758/UAT, dated 24.11.2010 in response to which
Government by communication dated 06.04.2011 while giving a
clarification asked by the university, instructed it to obtain
clarification from S.P., C.I.D., Crime Branch, Cuttack in the matter if,

                                   6
there is any development to the criminal case. To the quarries of the
university, the S.P. Crime Branch, Cuttack submitted the reply
indicating that they have not preferred any appeal against the
judgment of the High Court, the opposite party university justified its
action taking the protection of Statute 45(1)(2) of the OUAT
University Statute, which provides no university employee shall be
granted leave of any kind for continuous period exceeding five years.
On placing the clarification of the State Government as well as the
inputs provided by the S.P. Crime Branch, Cuttack, the Board of
Management while considering the matter of the petitioner resolved
for no service benefit including the pensionary benefits for the period
of absence of the petitioner.
8.           In the above premises, it is now necessary to consider as
to whether the petitioner’s absence from service over 5 years is bona
fide and he has to suffer the entire period of his absence, in view of
the provision at 45(1) and (2) of the Orissa University of Agriculture
and Technology Statute, 1986? And further if the petitioner had
suffered on account of non-compliance of principle of natural justice
before providing a major penalty vide Annexure-9.
             Before proceeding to answer the above issues, it is
necessary here to reproduce the provisions contained at provision
45(1) and (2) of the University of Agriculture and Technology Statute,
1966.
             “45.(1) No University employee shall be granted
             leave of any kind for a continuous period
             exceeding 5 years.

                                    7
             (2) Where a University employees does not
             reasume duty after remaining on leave for a
             continuous period of 5 years or where a University
             employee after expiry of his leave remains absent
             from duty otherwise than on foreign service or an
             account of suspension, for any period which
             together with the period of the leave granted to
             him exceeds 5 years, he          shall unless the
             University     in   view    of   the   exceptional
             circumstances of the case otherwise determine, be
             deemed to have resigned and shall accordingly
             cease to be in the employment of the University.”
9.           On bare perusal of the above provisions makes it clear
that the provision applies to a person/employee, who does not resume
duty after remaining on leave for a continuous period of five years or
where a university employee after expiry of his leave remains absent
from duty otherwise than on foreign service on account of suspension
for any period which together with the period of the leave granted to
him during suspension exceeds five years, he shall unless the
university in view of the exceptional circumstances of the case
otherwise determine, be deemed to have resigned. It is in this context
since the petitioner remains absent for his languishing in jail as
because of his suffering a judgment of conviction in a criminal
proceeding in S.T. Case Nos.174/101/107 of 2005/2004, S.T. Case
Nos.175/102/204 of 2005/2004 and S.T. Case Nos.176/8/26 of 2005,
he was absenting from his duty under the compelling circumstance.

                                    8
For his acquittal by this Court in Criminal Appeal No.564 of 2006 and
Criminal Appeal No.38 of 2007 ought to have been treated an
exceptional circumstance and as such provision contained in 45(1)
and (2) of the OUAT Statute, 1966, have been misapplied            to the
present case. The opposite party failed to understand the provisions
contained in its statute and has proceeded wrongly in the matter. The
impugned order under Annexure-9 being passed in above wrong
premises ought to suffer and observe to interfere and set aside.
10.           Besides the perusal of the opposite parties counter as well
as the argument made through their counsel during the course of
hearing it could not be made clear that the petitioner was provided
with an opportunity of show-cause before the passing of the impugned
major penalty order. The petitioner’s submission to the above regard
is found to have force.
11.           Under the above premises and the findings arrived at
while answering both the issues in favour of the petitioner and as
against the opposite parties, I declare the impugned order vide
Annexure-9 as bad in law and while setting aside the same I direct the
opposite parties to treat the petitioner to have been continuing in
service without any break in his service. So far as the prayer of the
petitioner for back wages is concerned, even though the petitioner was
prevented from joining his duty for his suffering on account of bad
judgment of conviction by the trial court yet keeping in mind that he
had not performed his duty for the entire period, he may be paid with
50% of back wages for the period under dispute.

                                   9
12.           Under the above circumstance, the writ petition succeeds
to the extent directed hereinabove. However, there shall be no order as
to costs.
                                      ……………………..
                                        Biswanath Rath, J.
