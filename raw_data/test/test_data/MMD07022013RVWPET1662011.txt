                          RVWPET NO. 166 OF 2011
07. 07.02.2013                Heard learned counsel for the parties.
               2.             This review petition has been filed seeking
               review of the judgment dated 228.7.2011 passed in W.P.
               (C) No. 11684 of 2009.
               3.             The petitioners, who are continuing as
               Junior Assistants in the office of the Engineer-in-Chief,
               Water   Resources    Department,     Orissa,  Bhubaneswar
               allegedly since 1992 filed the aforesaid writ petition
               challenging the judgment dated 3.8.2009 passed by the
               learned Orissa Administrative Tribunal in O.A. No. 754 of
               2009 as well as the order dated 28.7.2009 under
               Annexure-9 to the writ petition passed by the Engineer-
               in-Chief,     Water    Resources     Department,    Orissa,
               Bhubaneswar and the order dated 2.7.2009              under
               Annexurre-10 to the writ petition passed by the State
               Government. A further prayer was made in the writ
               petition to issue a direction to the opp. parties to
               regularize the services of the petitioners against the post
               of    Junior Assistants in terms of the recommendation
               made by the Engineer-in-Chief under Annexures – 4 and
               7 and in terms of the direction given by the learned
               Tribunal in two other Original Applications, being O.A.
               Nos. 604 of 2006 and 1083 (C) of 2007.
               4.             This Court by the judgment under review
               considering   the   case   of  the   petitioners ultimately
               dismissed the writ petition finding no merit therein.

5.             Mr.   Routray,    learned   senior   counsel
appearing for the review petitioners     vehemently urges
that even though a question was raised while hearing the
writ petition on behalf of the petitioners that in similar
identical cases, the State Government has relaxed the
rules and regularized     the services of the employees of
other departments, the same having not been done in
the    case   of   the   petitioners,  and    instead,   the
recommendation         of   the   Engineer   –in-Chief    for
regularizing the services of the petitioners has been
rejected by the Government by order dated 27.10.2007,
the same amounts to discrimination resulting in violation
of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and this aspect
has not been taken into consideration in the judgment
under review. Non-consideration of the above submission
which was also given in the note of submissions by the
petitioners during hearing of the writ petition amounts to
an error on the face of the judgment and the same is
liable to be reviewed. He further submits that during the
course of hearing of the writ petition, orders of relaxation
made by the State Government in exercise of Rule 14
read with Rule 22 of the Orissa Ministerial Service Rules,
1994 were produced before this Court and         brought to
the notice of the Court and this Court has held in the
judgment that even if a Department of the State
Government      has committed a mistake and has taken a
decision contrary to the decision of the apex Court, the
said decision cannot be said to be binding on the State

Government. It is further submitted by Mr. Routray that
if the State Government has invoked the power of
relaxation under the self-same rules to different set of
employees of different Departments, there is no reason as
to why the said power of relaxation cannot be invoked in
view of the law laid down in the case of Ashok Kumar
Uppal v. State of J & K, AIR 1998 SC 2812.
6.             A counter affidavit to the review petition
has been filed on behalf of the State taking a stand that
the review petition is not maintainable as this Court in
the judgment under review has considered the plea of
relaxation of Orissa Ministerial Services Rules, 1994 in
proper perspective and the judgment does not suffer from
any error apparent on the face of the record. Learned
counsel for the State also submits that on perusal of the
judgment under review, it would be seen that this Court
considering all issues involved in the case and all
contentions raised before it by the petitioners passed the
judgment which neither suffers from any error apparent
on the face of record nor the judgment leads to failure of
justice. Learned counsel for the State has further
contended that once the case has been fully argued on
merits and    decided on merits, no application for review
lies for re-appreciating and/or rehearing the contentions
already raised and considered at the time of hearing.
Reviewing the judgment on the grounds taken by the
petitioners would amount to giving the petitioners a fresh
innings. Thus,   it is contended that there being no cause

for reviewing the judgment, the review petition is liable to
be dismissed.
7.             Mr. Routray, learned senior counsel for the
petitioners   draws   our   attention   to  the   notes   of
submissions filed during the course of hearing of the writ
petition, where, it was specifically stated that in case of
different departments including the Departments of
Agriculture and Law, services of the similar employees
have been regularized by relaxing the provision of Rule 14
read with Rule 22 of the Orissa Ministerial Service Rules,
which documents were produced before this Court.
8.             On perusal of the judgment under review, it
is seen that the plea of the petitioners that they are
continuing from 1992 on ad hoc basis was, in fact, the
result of an interim order passed by the learned Tribunal
by which they were permitted to continue as such and
the learned Tribunal in the said Original Application,
being O.A. No. 629 (C) of 1992, in respect of some of the
employees directed that they may be allowed to continue
on ad hoc basis until regular selection is made and they
should be given chance to apply for the post and compete
with others and, if necessary, their upper age limit be
relaxed. Thus, this Court found that it is clear that the
petitioners have worked from 1992 to 1996 on ad hoc
basis without intervention of the Court and since 1996,
they have been continuing on ad hoc basis because of the
order passed by the learned Tribunal.

9.             This Court considering the exception made
in the decision of the apex Court in the case of
Secretary, State of Karnataka and others v. Umadevi
and others, (2006)4 SCC 1 and accepting the contention
of the petitioners that appointment of the petitioners,
even though irregular, found that the petitioners have not
completed ten years of service without intervention of the
Court.
10.            With regard to discrimination, as alleged in
the review petition, in the judgment under review, this
Court categorically took note of the said submission
made on behalf of the petitioners and held that as per the
ratio of the judgment in the case of Secretary, State of
Karnataka and others v. Umadevi and others (supra), no
such regularization could be made by any Department
ignoring the law laid down by the apex Court and,
therefore, merely because one Department has committed
a mistake, the Resources Department cannot be directed
to commit the same mistake, specially, on the face of the
judgment of the apex Court      in the case of Secretary,
State of Karnataka and others v. Umadevi and others
(supra).
11.            We, therefore, repel the contention of the
review petitioners that the submission with regard to
discrimination on the ground that relaxation of Rules 14
and 22 of the Orissa Ministerial Service Rules has been
made by some of the Departments       was not taken into
consideration is incorrect . We find no error apparent on

      the face of the judgment under review so as to exercise
      the power of review of this Court.
                    The RVWPET stands dismissed.
                    Urgent certified copy of this order be
      granted as per rules.
