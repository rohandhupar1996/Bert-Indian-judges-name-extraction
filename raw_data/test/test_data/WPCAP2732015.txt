against the respondent No. 7, the Member Secretary of the said Zilla Parishad

Member Secretary of the said Zilla Parishad issued the impugned notice in

as Member Secretary of the Zilla Parishad, without any authority in law and in
violation of the provisions of Section 96 of the Arunachal Pradesh Panchayat
Raj Act, 1997 (1997 Act, in short) without placing the same before the
Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad for convening the meeting, usurping the
power and authority of the petitioner as Chairperson.
9)          Mr. Nair urged that the action on the part of the Member Secretary
of the said Zilla Parishad in issuing the impugned Notice dated 10.07.2015 is
illegal, malafide, with ulterior motive and on extraneous consideration, not in
exercise of his official duty but with personal and vested interest.

specify the exact venue of the meeting in question as there are three

            in the member prescribed at least five days before the prime fixed for such
            meeting and no business shall be brought before or transacted at any meeting at
            the than business of which notice has been given except the approval of the
            majority of the members present at such meeting:
                 Provided that if the Chairperson thinks that a situation has arisen for which
            an emergent meeting of the Zilla Parishad should be called, he may call such
            meeting after giving three days’ notice to the members:
                 Provided further that not more than one business shall be included in the list
            of business to be transacted at such emergent meeting.
19)         For a motion of no-confidence against Chairperson of Zilla Parishad
as provided under Section 95 of the 1997 Act provisions of Section 63 of the
said Act is required to be followed. As per Section 63 of the Act for moving a
WP(C) 273 AP 2015                                                                  Page 9 of 12

                                      - 10 -
motion of no-confidence against the Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad, it has
to be moved (i) by the minimum of one-third of the total number of members
of the Zilla Parishad, with (ii) seven days clear notice in writing to the
Member Secretary or any other prescribed authority of the Zilla Parishad of
its intention to move such a motion.         When the motion is carried by a
majority of not less than two thirds of the total number of members of the
Zilla Parishad, the Chairperson shall cease to hold office and but in such
meeting, where a motion of no-confidence against him is under discussion,
the Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad shall not preside at the meeting; but he
shall have the right to speak or otherwise take part in the proceedings of
such meeting so that he can defend the allegations made against him and
explain the same to the members of the Parishad.
(20)          List of business to be transacted at a meeting of Zilla Parishad
has been prescribed under Section 97 of the Act and except the provisions of
Section 96 of the said 1997 Act; there are no other provisions in the Act for
meeting of Zilla Parishad. Going through the provisions of the said 1997 Act,
it is seen that for the purpose of moving a no-confidence motion against the
Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad, as provided under Section 63 of the Act,
requisite members of the Zilla Parishad are required to give a written notice
to the Member Secretary of the said Parishad and after clear seven days time
such meeting for no-confidence is required to be convene.
(21)        Since Section 63 the said 1997 Act specifically dealts with the
motion of no confidence against the Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad, the
provisions of Section 96, with regard to the meeting of Zilla Parishad or
Section 97, with regard to the list of business to be transacted at a meeting
of Zilla Parishad, shall not come in to play as the provisions of Section 95 &
63 and Sections 96 & 97 cannot be equated for the purpose of motion of no
confidence and meeting of Zilla Parishad.

(22)        I have gone through the judgments cited on behalf of the
petitioners and considered them.        Those judgments relate to the Assam
Panchayat Act, 1994 as amended, where there are specific provisions under
the Assam Panchayat Act, 1994 as amended. As such said judgments are not
applicable in the present case.
(23)        From the reading of Section 95 & 63 of the Act, it is seen that to
move a no-confidence motion against the Chairperson of the Parishad, there
has to be a meeting and in the said meeting, the Chairperson though cannot
preside in it; but he has the right to speak or otherwise take part in the
proceedings of such meeting.
(24)        On receipt of the proper written notice from the requisite numbers
of ZPMs to move no confidence against the Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad
as provided under Section 63 of the Act, the Member Secretary of the Zilla
Parishad becomes empowered to convene the meeting to take up the said
motion of no confidence.
(25)        For the reasons aforesaid, the Court is of the view that for the
purpose of moving a no-confidence motion against the Chairperson of the
Zilla Parishad under the said 1997 Act, the Member Secretary of the Zilla
Parishad upon receipt of the written notice from the requisite numbers of
ZPMs, he is empowered to convene the meeting of no confidence against the
Chairperson of the Zilla Parishad in terms of Section 63 of the Arunachal
Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1997.
(26)        Accordingly, no illegality has been found with regard to the
impugned Notice of No-Confidence Motion issued by the Member Secretary of
Lower Subansiri Zilla Parishad under Memo No. ZRO/ZP-NCM/2015 dated 10-
07-2015 convening Zilla Parishad meeting of Lower Subansiri District.

(27)       In view of the above, this petition being devoid of merit stands
dismissed.   Consequently the interim order passed on 16.07.2015 stands
vacated.
(28)       No order as to costs.
                                                                    JUDGE
