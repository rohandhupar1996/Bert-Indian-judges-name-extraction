                        THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Date of Hearing: 28.9.2016                         Date of Judgment: 07.10.2016.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biswanath Rath,J.                     This Writ Petition has been filed assailing the final order
          dated 27.11.1996 passed by the Opp. party No.1- Commissioner, Land
          Records and Settlement, Orissa, Cuttack in R.P. Case No.2011 of 1996
          and R.P. Case No.2012 of 1996.
          2.        Succinctly stated the case of the petitioner is that Hal Plot No.29
          measuring an area Ao.54 decimals under Hal Khata No.70 (suit land in
          R.P.No.2011/1996) corresponding to Sabik plot No.34 under Sabik Khata
          No.38 measuring an area Ao.54 decimals stood recorded in the names of
          Bansidhar Panda, Kelu Panda, Nidhi Panda-all sons of Chanduri Panda
          with 12 annas share and                       Sukuti Panda, Chemei Panda-both sons of

                                       2
Baidhar Panda with 4 annas share in the 1928 R.O.R. Similarly in the
1928 R.O.R, fourteen Hal plots under Hal Khata No.69 (suit plots in
R.P.No.2012 of 1996) measuring total area A.3.32 decimals relate to
Sabik Khata Nos.15, 14 and 38 stood recorded in the names of Bansidhar
Panda, Nidhi Panda, Kelu Panda – all sons of Chanduri Panda. Out of
Ao.54 decimals in Hal Plot No.29 corresponding to Sabik plot No.24
Bansidhar, Kelu and Nidhi were jointly possessing 12 annas share. After
their death, petitioners being the successors / legal heirs are in joint
possession of the aforesaid 12 annas share and claiming to be in
enjoyment of the said property peacefully. Similarly in fourteen Hal plots
under Hal Khata No.69 corresponding to Sabik Khata Nos.14, 15, 38
measuring A.3.32 decimals,          Bansidhar Panda, Kelu Panda and Nidhi
Panda were jointly enjoying being in joint possession. After their death,
the petitioners being successors/legal heirs are in joint possession and
possessing peacefully.
        This status continued till 1995, in which year during settlement
operation, the Opp. party Nos.3 and 4 appearing before the Assistant
Settlement Officer claimed themselves to be the legal heirs of one
Chakradhar Panda being grand-sons. Recording oral statements of these
parties, the Assistant Settlement Officer directed inclusion of legal heirs of
Chakradhar Panda in the Hal R.O.R. Consequently the R.O.R including
the names of Opp. party Nos.3 and 4 was published on 02.3.1996.
        It is at this point of time, the petitioners objecting to such inclusion,
filed the aforesaid two R.P. Cases under Section 15 of the Orissa Survey
and Settlement Act, 1958. The Revision petitions have been dismissed
against the petitioners.
        Assailing the impugned orders in the aforesaid two R. P. cases
decided in a common judgment, the petitioners claimed that there is a
dispute with regard to claim of Opp. party Nos.3 and 4 being the legal
heirs of Chanduri Panda through Chakradhar Panda. Further since the
original R.O.R did not include the name of ancestors of Opp. party Nos.3
and 4 and the said R.O.R having not been challenged till 1996, the Hal

                                    3
R.O.R was published, rejection of the case of the petitioners in their
revisions in absence of their above contentions, is illegal and therefore
the petitioners claimed for interference in the order impugned herein and
for setting aside the same. Petitioners also pleaded that the claim of the
Opp. party Nos.3 and 4 on the basis of some amicable settlement
involving allotment of four annas share, has also no foundation. Besides
the evidence recorded during settlement proceeding being not clear, the
findings and the conclusion arrived by the Revisional authority, also
becomes wrong.
3.      While the matter was taken up for hearing, none appeared on
behalf of the private Opp. parties although a set of learned counsels
already entered their appearance for them by filing Vakalatnama.
4.      Mr.K.K.Mishra, learned Additional Government Advocate refuting
the contentions raised by Mr.Pani, learned counsel for the petitioners
contended that in view of clear and cogent observation and findings of the
revisional authority, there is no scope for interference in the order
impugned herein. Mr.Mishra further contended that the writ petition is
based on suppression of material facts, for which the writ petition should
be dismissed on this score.
5.      Considering the submissions of the learned counsels appearing for
the parties, this Court finds there is no dispute with regard to involvement
of the parties in the particular R.P. Case Nos.2011 and 2012 of 1996.
While going through the revisional orders impugned herein, this Court
finds that in a previous attempt, considering the objection of the present
petitioners that the present private Opp. parties are strangers to their
family, the Assistant Settlement Officer during Settlement operation after
holding due enquiry came to conclusion that Chakdradhar Panda was one
of the sons of late Chanduru Panda being the common ancestor of both
the parties and consequently the Assistant Settlement Officer after due
enquiry had directed      for inclusion of the names of the private Opp.
parties. Against such recording, the petitioners preferred two Appeals
bearing Nos.1437 of 1994 and 1438 of 1994 involving the properties in

                                     4
both the R.P.Nos.2011 and 2012 of 1996 .Both the Appeals were
dismissed upholding the orders of the Assistant Settlement Officer. There
has been no further challenge to the orders initially passed by the
Assistant Settlement Officer and by the appellate authorities. Hence the
findings therein remain confirmed and conclusive against the present
petitioners and under the circumstances the petitioners were not entitled
to bring the matter again to the Revisional court under Section 15 of the
Orissa Survey and Settlement Act. Further for the observation and
findings during preparation of Hal Settlement R.O.R and in the Appeals,
nothing also survives to reopen the case of the petitioners challenging the
status of the private Opp. parties. Consequently this Court holds, the
Revisional Authority did no wrong in dismissing the revision.
6.       Under the circumstances, this Court while declining to interfere in
the impugned order under Annexure-1, dismissed the Writ petition for
having no merit.
         Parties to bear their respective cost.
                                                …………………………….
                                              BISWANATH RATH,J.
