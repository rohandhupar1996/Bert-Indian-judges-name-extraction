      Date of hearing & judgment : 02.09.2015
                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
        Oriental Insurance Company Limited as appellant has preferred this
appeal under Section 30 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, challenging
the judgment and award dated 30.09.2004 passed by the learned W.C.
Commissioner at Dhubri in W.C. Case No.55 of 1998. By that judgment and
award, the leaned tribunal has directed the Insurance Company to make
payment of Rs.1,97,060/- within a period of 30 days along with simple interest @
9% per annum with effect from the date of institution of the claim petition.
 [2]     One Musstt. Sayeda Banu filed a petition before the learned W.C.
Commissioner at Dhubri stating that her husband Abdul Aziz was engaged as
handiman in the vehicle No. AS-01/B-0785 owned by one Kanu Paul and met
with an accident on 31.08.1997. As a result of the accident he received grievous
injuries on his person and had to receive treatment at Dhubri Civil Hospital, Coch
Bihar Nursing Home and North Bengal Medical College Hospital. Internal
gangrene developed in his left bone and he succumbed to the injury on
13.07.1998. A police case was also registered in connection with the same
accident.
[3]         On being summoned the owner/ opposite party No.2 appeared and
admitted his written statement about employment of the victim as handiman in
his vehicle and disclosed that the handiman was paid Rs.2,100/-as his monthly
wages. The Opposite party No.2 also disclosed that the vehicle was covered
under valid insurance of the Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Claimant examined
2 witnesses including herself and proved that her husband was engaged as
handiman in the vehicle by the opposite party No.2 and that he had met with an
accident on 31.08.1997 due to which he sustained grievous injuries and
ultimately, died for formation of internal gangrene. She exhibited as many as 13
MFA No.8 of 2006

                                         3
documents including the postmortem report as Exhibit-1 and thus, the fact that
the victim died was duly proved. On considering all the materials available on
records, the learned W.C. Commissioner decided the case under Section 4(1)A of
the   Workmen’s      Compensation   Act   and  assessed   the  compensation     at
Rs.1,97,060/-. It is this judgment which has been brought under challenge in this
present appeal.
 [4]    I have heard Mr. S. Dutta, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. C.
Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant. None appears for the respondents,
although notices were duly served on them.
 [5]    Upon perusal of the lower courts records, the learned Senior Counsel Mr.
S. Dutta, submits that the whole of the awarded amount was deposited with the
jurisdictional W.C. Commissioner and thereupon , the same has been disbursed
to the claimant already and this may be the reason for which no one has put up
appearance even after the notice of the appeal was served.
[6]     This appeal was admitted on the sole substantial question of law as
follows:
        “Whether the Commissioner, Workmen’s Compensation, Dhubri can pass
the award without deciding the causal connection with the accident and the
employment of the deceased?”
[7]     The claimant has proved Exhibit-12, photograph of the victim which
shows that there was amputation on the left leg of the victim. By adducing
Exhibit-1 it is proved that he died on 16.07.1998, whereas the accident was
taken place on 31.08.1997. Exhibit-7 is the discharge certificate from North
Bengal Medical College Hospital showing that the victim was an indoor patient in
Word No.MS4 and bed No.18 and he was hospitalized for the period from
06.09.1997 to 13.01.1998 for multiple injuries following road traffic accident.
This certificate issued by the North Bengal Medical College Hospital is indicative
of the fact that the victim was given treatment by that medical college owing to
MFA No.8 of 2006

                                           4
the injuries received due to the road traffic accident. Exhibti-5 is the injury report
given by the Medical and Health Officer, Dhubri which also shows as many as 4
injuries. All of these are described as grievous injuries by the issuing doctor. This
certificate was issued on 14.10.1997. The postmortem report shows that the left
leg and foot of the deceased contained as many as 3 injuries, whereas injury
No.1 is a multiple fracture on left leg along with extreme superficial ulceration on
the lateral surface. All these are indicative of the fact that on the place of
amputation there was infection leading to ulceration. So, it is clear that the
misfortune of the victim had started from the accident and resulted in his
ultimate death which appears to be substantially proved. This being the position
the sole substantial question of law does not appear to arise in the present case.
Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.
[8]      No order as to costs.
[9]      Send down the records immediately.
                                                                           JUDGE
