                                     BEFORE
                THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE HRISHIKESH ROY
Date of Hearing and Judgment          :       20 th August, 2015
                       JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                Heard Mr. B. Ullah, the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner. The legal heirs of late Tafazzul Islam Saikia (respondent No.3) are
represented by the learned counsel Mr. Z. Mukit. The learned Govt. advocate Mr.
J. Handique appears for the Addl. D.C., Lakhimpur (respondent No.2).
2.             The petitioner is the youngest and unmarried daughter of late
Tafazzul Islam Saikia, who was the owner of land measuring 4 kathas 7 lechas
covered by Dag No.917 of K.P. Patta No.82 of 1st Part Map of North Lakhimpur
Town of Lakhimpur Mouza. A portion of this land measuring 336 sq.ft.
encompassing 2 rooms plus 12’ x 9’ veranda was orally gifted by the father in the
year 1991 and the petitioner accepted the gift and took possession of the gifted
property. In the gifted premises, the daughter started a tailoring establishment
under the name and style “Farnaz Fashion and Designer”. Subsequently the
father acknowledged the oral gift, through written document executed on
01.11.1996.
3.             After receiving the valuable gift from her father, the petitioner
applied for mutation under Section 50 of the Assam Land and Revenue
Regulation, 1886 (hereinafter referred to as the “Revenue Regulation”) and in
the resultant Mutation Case No.229/2002 an order was passed on 18.07.2002
(Annexure-I), whereby the Circle Officer noted the succession and the possession
WP(C) 2264/2008                                                         Page 2 of 8

of the daughter over the gifted property and accordingly mutation was granted in
respect of the property measuring 336 sq.ft. out of the total 4 kathas 7 lechas
land owned by the father.
4.             Being purportedly aggrieved by the mutation order, the donor
applied for cancellation of mutation on 20.03.2006 (Annexure-II), where the
father claimed that he has not executed any deed of gift and accordingly
projected that the mutation order was secured by the petitioner by producing
forged document. In the resultant Revenue Appeal Case No.6/2003, an order
was passed on 23.02.2006 (Annexure-III) by the Addl. D.C., North Lakhimpur,
where the officer noted that oral gift is valid under the Mohammedan Law and
once the 3 essential ingredients of a gift is complete and possession is obtained
prior to execution of the written document on the basis of the oral gift, the
mutation granted to the petitioner by the Circle Officer was found to be in order
and accordingly the father’s appeal under Section 147 of the Revenue Regulation
was dismissed through the order dated 23.02.2006 (Annexure-III) by the Addl.
D.C.
5.             The appellate authority’s order was assailed by respondent No.3 in
the Assam Board of Revenue (hereinafter referred to as the “Revenue Board”),
where the petitioner appeared. In the case No.85 RA(L)/06, the approach of the
Revenue Board was different. The document executed by the father on
01.11.1996 was considered to be the gift deed and since this was an
unregistered document, the Revenue Board opined that this cannot confer a valid
transfer to the daughter. Accordingly on this basis despite observing that
daughter is in possession of the land, the mutation order passed in her favour by
the Circle Officer and the Addl. D.C. was set aside by the Revenue Board,
through the impugned order dated 06.05.2008 (Annexure-IV).
6.1            Assailing the legality of the impugned order, Mr. B. Ullah, the
learned counsel submits that a fundamental error was committed by the Revenue
Board by construing the written document of 01.11.1996 to be the gift deed. The
petitioner submits the daughter was orally gifted a portion of the father’s
property in the year 1991, whereafter, she took possession and the document
written by the donor on 01.11.1996 simply acknowledges the previous oral gift
and the succession is not based on the written document. Therefore the
WP(C) 2264/2008                                                         Page 3 of 8

petitioner argues that since it was an oral gift by a mohammedan father to his
unmarried daughter, the rigors of transfer through a registered instrument
specified in Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter
referred to as the “T.P. Act”) will not apply to the oral gift and the 1991 oral
transaction would be saved by Section 129 of the T.P. Act.
6.2             The petitioner contends that she took possession of the property
soon after the oral gift in the year 1991 and subsequently she has obtained a
trade licence and have also paid the municipality tax for the gifted property and
accordingly it is argued by the petitioner that the written acknowledgement of
the oral gift was erroneously construed as a gift deed by the Revenue Board and
that is how they erred in their verdict.
6.3             Mr. B. Ullah, the learned counsel submits that Mohammedan Law
permits oral gift of immovable property and once the essential requirements of
(i) declaration of the gift by the donor (Ijab); (ii) acceptance of the gift by the
donee (Qabul); and (iii) delivery of possession (Qabda) is complete and the
donee takes possession, the verbal gift is valid and no written document is
required for transfer of valid title to the donee.
6.4             Since the legal heirs of the donor Md. Tafazzul Islam Saikia has
contested this case by filing counter affidavit after the death of the donor on
17.01.2010, Mr. Ullah contends that the Warish or the legal heirs cannot contest
the oral gift, as that was within the knowledge of the donor and the donee and
the successors can’t go against the wish of their father.
7.1             On the other hand, Mr. Z. Mukit, the learned counsel submits that
the donor himself filed the Revenue Appeal Case No.6/2003 to challenge the
mutation granted to his daughter by the Circle Officer on 18.07.2002 (Annexure-
I) and accordingly it is argued that the case projected by the legal heirs is
consistent with the stand taken by the donor himself, in his lifetime.
7.2             The learned counsel for the private respondents refers to the
written acknowledgement of the donor made on 01.11.1996 (Annexure-1 in the
counter affidavit) to contend that interpolation was made in that document to
create a 2nd document (Annexure-2 to the counter affidavit) to acknowledge the
previous oral gift by the donor and it was the donor himself who in his challenge
WP(C) 2264/2008                                                          Page 4 of 8

to the mutation order stated that the daughter secured mutation on the basis of
forged document. Since fraud obliterates everything, Mr. Mukit argues that the
petitioner could not secure any valid right over her father’s property, on the basis
of such forged document or the so called oral gift.
7.3             The learned counsel submits that since the issue of title arising out
of forged document crops up in the present case, the matter could not have
been decided by the Revenue Authorities and under Section 154 of the Revenue
Regulation, the case should be left to be decided by the Civil Court.
8.              The gift of immovable property under Section 123 of the T.P. Act
can only be effected by a registered instrument, but an exception is curved out
by Section 129 in respect of gifts made under the provision of the Mohammedan
Law, where property transfer through oral gifting is legally recognized.
9.              In Illahi Shamsuddin Nadaf Vs. Jaitunbi Makbul reported in
1994(5) SCC 476, the Supreme Court acknowledged that “an oral gift is perfectly
valid under the Mohammedan Law. The declaration as well as acceptance of the
gift may be oral whatever may be the nature of the property gifted.” Similarly
this Court in Md. Hesabuddin Vs. Md. Hesaruddin reported in AIR 1984 GAU 41
declared that a gift under the Mohammedan Law is legally valid once the 3
essential ingredients of Ijab, Qabul and Qabda are fulfilled and the possession of
the gifted property is taken over by the donee. The rigors of Section 123 of the
T.P. Act for such oral gift is also addressed by the High Court in this decision.
Similar views were taken by this Court in Jubeda Khatoon Vs. Moksed Ali
reported in AIR 1973 GAU 105, Nurumahal Nessa Vs. Dr. Abdul Hakim reported
in 1995(2) GLT 492 and Saiful Islam Vs. Hasen Ali reported in 2001(1) GLT 1.
10.             What emerges from the above discussion is that under the
Mohammedan Law, a registered document is unnecessary for gifting immovable
property and if the 3 essential ingredients are satisfied, the donee acquires a
valid title through an oral gift. In this case, the daughter claims the gift to have
been made by her father orally in the year 1991 and according to her, the
written document subsequently executed by the father on 01.11.1996, simply
acknowledges the previous oral gift. But the impugned order of the Revenue
Board clearly shows that the claim of an oral gift projected by the daughter was
overlooked and instead the written acknowledgment of 01.11.1996 was
WP(C) 2264/2008                                                            Page 5 of 8

construed as the gift deed, whereby the transfer of property was allegedly
effected.
11.              If a written document is the instrument of gift, the same is
compulsorily registerable through application of Section 123 of the T.P. Act. But
at the same time unless the 3 essential ingredients of gifting is satisfied under
the Mohammedan Law, mere registration of the document does not confer legal
validity on the transaction. Here the Revenue Board construed the document of
01.11.1996 executed by the father to be the instrument of gift and since the said
document was unregistered, it was thus held that the daughter does not acquire
valid title through such unregistered gift deed and on that basis the order passed
by the Addl. D.C. on 23.02.2006 (Annexure-II) in the Revenue Appeal Case
No.6/2003 was held to be invalid.
12.              But the issue here is whether it is a case of succession through
oral gift because the petitioner’s projected case is that she accepted the oral gift
from her father in 1991 and took possession of the gifted property. In fact, the
possession of the daughter is acknowledged by all the forums and that is how
the mutation was granted to her on 18.07.2002 (Annexure-I) by the Circle
Officer.
13.              According to the respondents, interpolation was made in the
written document executed by their father on 01.11.1996 to reflect that the
property was gifted orally to the daughter earlier in the year 1991. In fact, in the
application filed by Md. Tafazzul Islam on 20.03.2006 (Annexure-II) it is alleged
that the petitioner secured mutation by producing forged document and the
applicant never executed any deed of gift in favour of his daughter. When
allegation of forgery is made by a party and on that basis the transfer of title is
questioned, the proper forum for adjudication of such dispute is the Civil Court
and Section 154 of the Revenue Regulation gets attracted to such matters. In
Sukumari Dev Vs. Manindra Ch. Dev reported in (1991)1 GLR 236, this Court
after referring to the provisions of Section 154, held that the Civil Court is the
best authority to decide title over property and can also direct cancellation of
mutation in such cases.
14.              It is apparent in the present case that the adjudication process
must take into account the allegation of forgery made by the donor. The title
WP(C) 2264/2008                                                           Page 6 of 8

issue of the gifted property is also required to be decided. Thus while deciding
the appropriate forum, these two factors must be taken into account.
15.             Mutation under Section 50 of the Revenue Regulation is granted
primarily on the basis of possession by the person succeeding to the estate but it
well known that mutation does not confer any title. Therefore, on the strength of
the mutation order granted to her on 18.07.2002 (Annexure-I), the daughter
cannot claim a legal title, although she may be in possession of the gifted
property.
16.             It may also be borne in mind that revocation of gift by the donor
even after delivery of possession is permissible. But the gift can be revoked only
by the donor and not by his legal heirs when the donor is dead. However under
sub-clause (4) of Section 167 of the Mohammedan Law, once possession is
delivered, revocation of gift can be ordered only through a decree of the Civil
Court.
17.             When the Court is confronted with an allegation of forgery and the
revocation of gifted property is sought by the legal heirs after possession is
delivered and taken over by the donee, the proper forum to decide the issue in
my perception is the Civil Court where the contesting parties can lay their
evidence. In this case the donor and now his legal heirs, are questioning the
legality of the gift and have applied for revocation. In their challenge, the donor
alleges forgery of the written instrument whereby the oral gift was acknowledged
by the donor. In such circumstances, consistent with the provisions of Section
154 of the Revenue Regulation, since the Revenue authorities are not the best
forum to decide the issue of title and the question of forgery, it has to be held
that the aggrieved party who make the challenge should go to the Civil Court, if
so advised. In that event, if a case is made out by the challengers, the Civil Court
can declare the oral gift to be invalid and revoke the same and the title of the
land can also be declared in favour of the donor or their successors. The
consequential order for correction of mutation can also be ordered by the Civil
Court as was held in Sukumari Dev (supra).
18.             When the petitioner claims her right to the gifted property on the
basis of a verbal gift made by the father to the daughter in the year 1991, the
Revenue Board should not have described the written acknowledgement of the
WP(C) 2264/2008                                                            Page 7 of 8

    donor to be the gift deed. Of course, the appellant before the Revenue Board
    could have projected that no oral gift was made, but this aspect was never taken
    into consideration and the Revenue Board proceeded with the erroneous
    understanding that the written acknowledgement of 01.11.1996 was the gift
    deed. According to me this was an incorrect approach and therefore the
    impugned judgment of the Revenue Board rendered in the Case No.85RA(L)/06
    is declared to be vitiated and the same is accordingly quashed. But this order will
    not preclude the right of the respondents if so advised, to approach the Civil
    Court to apply for revocation of the gift and for declaration of title in their own
    favour, as the successors of the donor Md. Tafazzul Islam Saikia. It is ordered
    accordingly.
    19.            With the above order, this case stands allowed without any order
    on cost.
                                                                           JUDGE
