                                   Date of Judgment               :     09.03.2011
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.R. Dash, J.                 Both the appeals arise out of the judgment and order of
            sentence dated 13.12.2000 and 22.01.2001 respectively passed by
            learned First Additional Sessions Judge, Puri in Sessions Trial No.
            7/106 of 1997.            Learned trial court found accused Debaraj Baral
            (appellant in JCRLA No. 30 of 2001) and accused Sukanta Kishore
            Baral and Akshaya Baral (appellants in CRLA No. 33 of 2001) guilty
            of offence under Section 302/34, I.P.C. and sentenced each of them to
            suffer imprisonment for life.
            2.                Prosecution case, as found from the record, is that the
            occurrence happened in between 11 a.m. to 12 noon on 09.1.1994 at
            village Balikuda under Satyabadi P.S. in the district of Puri. Deceased
            Chhaila Pradhan at that time was sitting on the verandah in front of
            his house. Sukanta Baral, Akshaya Baral and Debaraj Baral (present
            appellants) along with Sagar Baral and Budhinath Baral came in front
            of the house of the deceased Chhaila Pradhan and started abusing him
            in filthy language.            The deceased protested to such action of the
            appellant and others. All of a sudden, appellant Sukanta Baral and
            Akshaya Baral caught hold of the deceased, and at that time appellant
            Debaraj Baral dealt a ‘farsha’ blow on the head of the deceased and
            the deceased fell down unconscious at the spot. Laxmidhar Pradhan
            (P.W.9), who happens to be the son of deceased Chhaila Pradhan,
            raised hulla seeing the assault on his father. When the other witnesses
            came, the accused persons decamped from the spot, and while so
            decamping appellant Sukanta Baral threw a ‘katari’ aiming at

                                    3
Laxmidhar Pradhan (P.W.9), for which he sustained injuries on his
right leg. On the basis of the report lodged by Laxmidhar Pradhan
(P.W.9), a case for the offence punishable under Sections
341/342/323/326/307/354/34, I.P.C. was registered by the S.I. of
Police, Satyabadi P.S. (examined as P.W.20). In course of treatment
at hospital, deceased Chhaila Pradhan succumbed to the injuries, and
the case turned to one under Section 302, I.P.C. On completion of the
investigation, the O.I.C., Satbayadi P.S. (P.W.18), who took up the
charge of investigation at a subsequent stage, filed charge-sheet.
3.            The prosecution has examined 20 witnesses to prove the
charge. P.W.9 is the informant, P.Ws.3 and 5 are eye-witnesses to the
occurrence.    P.W.1 is the Medical Officer, who had examined
deceased Chhaila Pradhan on police requisition and had also recorded
his dying declaration vide Ext.6. Subsequently P.W.19 conducted
post-mortem over the dead body of the deceased on his death.
P.Ws.2, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 do not support the prosecution case.
P.Ws.4 and 13 are witnesses to the seizure. P.W.6 is a witness to the
recovery and seizure of the ‘farsha’, the weapon of offence, at the
instance of convict Debaraj Baral.      P.W.14 is the witness to the
inquest. P.Ws.15, 16 and 17 are the witnesses, who stated that they do
not know anything about the occurrence. P.Ws.18 and 20 are the
Investigating Officers of the case.
              The defence plea is one of complete denial and no
witness has been examined by the defence.
4.            Learned trial court, on consideration of the evidence on
record, found the aforesaid three appellants guilty of the offence under

                                     4
Section 302/34, I.P.C. and acquitted the other co-accused persons of
the charge under Sections 302/323/324/342/354/34, I.P.C.
5.           Learned counsel for the appellant Debaraj Baral (in
JCRLA No.30 of 2001) submits that in view of the discrepancies and
contradictions in the evidence of P.Ws.3 and 5, learned trial court
should not have returned the finding of guilt against the appellant.
Learned counsel for the appellants Sukanta Baral and Akshaya Baral
(in CRLA No.33 of 2001) while supporting the aforesaid contention
advanced by learned counsel for appellant Debaraj Baral, further
submits that in the midst of quarrel convict Sukanta Baral and
Akshaya Baral caught hold of the deceased and at that time convict
Debaraj Baral having mounted the assault on the deceased by ‘farsha’
(M.O.-I), these appellants Sukanta Baral and Akshaya Baral should
not have been found guilty of offence under Section 302, I.P.C. by aid
of Section 34 thereof.
             Learned counsel for the State on the other hand supports
the impugned judgment and order of sentence.
6.           Evidence of P.W.1, who examined the deceased Chhaila
Pradhan during his treatment on police requisition, shows that the
deceased had sustained the following injuries -
       (i)   Incised wound 5” x ½” x 1/4” extending over
             right front parietal region.
       (ii)  Contusion 5½” x 3” surrounding the injury No. (i).
He (P.W.1) further opined that injury no.(i) has been caused by sharp-
cutting weapon.

                                    5
       P.W.19, the Medical Officer, who conducted post-mortem on
the dead body of the deceased, has testified that the cause of death is
shock and hemorrhage due to the aforesaid injuries on the skull bone
affecting the brain tissues. From the aforesaid evidence of P.Ws.1 and
19, it is clear that there has been assault by a sharp cutting weapon
and only one blow has been given by the assailant. There was no
injury on any other part of the body of the deceased.
              The evidence of P.Ws.3 and 5 shows that the accused
persons including the appellants were quarrelling with the deceased in
front of the house of the deceased. The deceased protested to such act
of the accused persons. At this, accused Sukanta Baral and Akahsya
Baral caught hold of the deceased and at that moment accused
Debaraj Baral dealt a ‘farsha’ blow on the head of the deceased.
7.            P.W.3, in his cross-examination, has specifically testified
that at the beginning of the occurrence the accused persons were not
armed with any weapon of offence. He has further testified that in
course of the incident, accused Debaraj Baral might have obtained the
‘farsha’, by which he assaulted the deceased. P.W.5, in his cross-
examination, has testified that the entire incident continued for about
two hours.
              The deceased in his dying declaration (Ext.6) has stated
that accused Akshaya Baral and Sukanta Baral caught hold of him and
dragged and accused Debaraj Baral dealt a ‘farsha’ blow on his head.
              Evidence of P.Ws.3 and 5, therefore, finds corroboration
in the dying declaration of the deceased, recorded vide Ext.6 and vice-

                                    6
versa. While recording the evidence of P.W.1, learned court below
has wrongly recorded the name of accused Sukanta Baral as Subala
Baral, and in this case there is no accused facing trial in the name of
Subala Baral. On scrutiny of Ext.6, we find that the deceased has
stated before the Medical Officer (P.W.1) that Akshaya Baral and
Sukanta Baral manhandled him (‘TANA OTORA KALE’) while he
protested and at that time accused Debaraj Baral gave a ‘farsha’ blow
on his head. From the sequence of events leading to the action of
accused Debaraj in giving the ‘farsha’ blow to the deceased, it is
found that no where the witnesses have testified in a manner to give
the impression that accused Sukanta Baral and Akshaya Baral caught
hold of the deceased to facilitate ‘farsha’ blow by Debaraj Baral.
Rather it is found from the evidence on record and from the dying
declaration of the deceased that when the deceased protested to use of
obscene words against him by the accused persons, Sukanta Baral and
Akshaya Baral came and manhandled him (‘TANA OTORA KALE’).
At that time accused Debaraj Baral dealt a ‘farsha’ blow on the head
of the deceased. As found from the evidence of P.W.3, none of the
accused persons were armed at the beginning of the incident and
P.W.3 has further testified that Debaraj Baral might have brought the
‘farsha’ in course of the incident. Such evidence on record makes it
clear that appellants Sukanta Baral and Akshaya Baral might not have
any knowledge about the fact that Debaraj Baral is holding a ‘farsha’
and he may mount assault on the deceased by said ‘farsha’ all of a
sudden. If the appellants had any intention to kill the deceased, they
could have done it immediately after beginning of the occurrence and
they would not have waited for a long period, in as much as we find

                                    7
from the evidence of P.W.5 that the incident continued for about two
hours.
8.            Taking into consideration the sequence of events leading
to the assault on the deceased by Debaraj Baral by means of ‘farsha’
(M.O.-I), we are of the view that accused Sukanta Baral and Akshaya
Baral cannot be held to have shared the common intention with
accused Debaraj Baral, so far as the fatal assault is concerned, in as
much as they had no knowledge about the ‘farsha’ held by Debaraj
when they caught hold of the deceased. Reacting to the protest by the
deceased, they only rushed to the deceased to manhandle him. The
appellants namely Sukanta Baral and Akshaya Baral, for the act they
have committed, at best be held to be guilty of the offence punishable
under Section 352, I.P.C., as their action in manhandling the deceased
when he protested to the use of obscene words by them, amounts to
use of criminal force against the deceased otherwise than on a grave
and sudden provocation given by the deceased.           The appellants
namely Debaraj Baral is responsible for his individual act.
9.            Perusal of the evidence of P.Ws. 3 and 5 shows that
though there are some contradictions in their evidence so far as
narratives are concerned, on thorough scrutiny of their evidence in
entirety it is found that there is no major contradictions and both of
them are corroborated by the dying declaration of the deceased
recorded vide Ext.6. In that view of the matter, we do not find any
justification to accept the contention of learned counsel appearing for
appellant Debaraj Baral so as to disbelieve P.Ws.3 and 5 and the

                                     8
dying declaration recorded by P.W.1 to bail out the appellant Debaraj
Baral.
10.           From the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 19, it is found that the
blow by ‘farsha’ was given on the head of the deceased, which had
affected the brain tissues. From the injuries, as described by P.W.1, it
is clear that only one blow was given by ‘farsha’, which had caused
the incised wound of the size 5” x ½” x ¼” on the fronto-parietal
region of the head of the deceased. In the post-mortem report, Ext.22,
it is opined that cause of death is owing to shock and hemorrhage as
an effect of injury to skull bone and vital organ like brain tissues. In
such a case more often it is submitted that the case should be covered
by Clause – 3rdly of Section 300, I.P.C., in as much as not only the
accused had intended to inflict that particular injury but the injury
intended to be inflicted was (by objective medical test) found to be
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The test laid
down in Virsa Singh’s case (AIR 1958 SC 465) for the applicability
of Clause – 3rdly of Section 300, I.P.C. is now ingrained in our
system and has become part of the rule of law. Under Clause – 3rdly
of Section 300, I.P.C. culpable homicide is murder if both the
following conditions are satisfied; (a) that the act, which causes death,
is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury, and (b) that the
injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of
nature to cause death. It must be proved, therefore, that there was an
intention on the part of the offender to inflict that particular bodily
injury, which, in the ordinary course of nature, was sufficient to cause
death, viz., that the injury found to be present was the injury that was
intended to be inflicted.

                                      9
              In the present case, therefore, the question that arises is
could it ever be held that appellant Debaraj Baral intended to inflict
the particular injury, which proved to be fatal. It is seen from the
evidence of P.Ws. 3 and 5 that they have not seen appellant Debaraj
Baral holding a ‘farsha’. There is nothing on record to show that
appellant Debaraj Baral had hidden that ‘farsha’ somewhere in his
person. The incident continued for about two hours, as found from
the evidence of P.W.5. When the deceased being positioned on his
‘pinda’ protested to the act of the appellants, Sukanta Kishore Baral
and Akshaya Baral rushed to him and caught hold of him, and at that
time accused Debaraj Baral gave a ‘farsha’ blow, which struck the
head of the deceased resulting in the aforesaid injury. There was no
premeditation. If there would have been premeditation, the appellant
Debaraj Baral could have assaulted the deceased without waiting for
about two hours to mount the assault. He could have come to the
scene of occurrence being armed. What has happened has happened
suddenly without premeditation in course of the quarrel between the
parties. In such a case Clause 3rdly of Section 300, I.P.C. would not
be attracted, because it cannot be said that appellant Debaraj Baral
intended to inflict that particular injury which ultimately was found to
have been inflicted and became fatal. Taking into consideration the
totality of circumstances, appellant Debaraj Baral having used a
‘farsha’ in inflicting the single injury, can be held to have the
knowledge that the injury he is going to inflict is likely to cause death.
The action of appellant Debaraj Baral, therefore, shall fall under Part-
II of Section 304, I.P.C.

                                            10
        11.           In view of our discussion supra, conviction of appellants
        Sukanta Kishore Baral and Akshaya Baral (in Criminal Appeal No. 33
        of 2001) under Section 302/34, I.P.C. is modified to one under
        Section 352/34, I.P.C.      Both of them having already undergone
        imprisonment for more than the maximum sentence prescribed for the
        offence they are held guilty of, be discharged of the bail bonds
        furnished in the present case.
                      Conviction of the appellant Debaraj Baral (in JCRLA
        No.30 of 2001) is modified to one under Section 304, Part-II, I.P.C.
        and he is sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for seven years.
        It is found from the order dated 25.08.2006 passed in Misc. Case No.
        27 of 2005 that appellant Debaraj Baral was in custody since 1994 and
        he was released on bail vide order dated 25.08.2006 passed in the
        aforesaid Misc. Case. He having already served the sentence awarded
        against him in this appeal, he be discharged of the bail bond furnished
        in the present appeal.
                      The Criminal Appeal is accordingly allowed in part and
        the Jail Crl. Appeal is also accordingly allowed in part.
