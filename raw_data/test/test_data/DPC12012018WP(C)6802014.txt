      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of hearing:05.12.2017                   Date of Judgment:12.01.2018
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. D.P.Choudhury, J. Since these two writ petitions have got common
      question of law involved, the same are being taken up together and are
      being disposed of by this common judgment.
      2.           Challenge has been made to the order passed by the learned
      District Judge, Cuttack, opposite party no.2 by posting the petitioners in
      W.P.(C) Nos.680 and 681 of 2014 as Sheristadar in the Court of the

                                    -2-
learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Kujanga and Sheristadar in the
Court of the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Jagatsinghpur
respectively illegally and the inaction of the opposite party no.2 in not
restoring the petitioners at Cuttack.
3.          The unfolded story of the case of the petitioner in W.P.(C)
No.680 of 2014 is that the petitioner was appointed as Junior Clerk on
01.03.1989 in the undivided district of Cuttack whereas the petitioner in
W.P.(C) No.681 of 2014 has been appointed as Junior Clerk on
19.08.1997 in the Court of the learned S.D.J.M., Athagarh in the
undivided judgeship of Cuttack. In 2012, when there was creation of
Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada and Jajpur judgeship, options were called for
from the employees of mother judgeship of Cuttack. Although the
petitioners gave their respective options to be retained in Cuttack.
4.          Be it stated that while the options were sought for on
carvation of judgeships, i.e., Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur on 17.05.2013
from the judgeship of Cuttack, the option of the petitioners were not
considered. On the other hand, after creation of separate judgeships on
24.06.2013, learned District Judge, Cuttack promoted the petitioners to
the cadre of Bench Clerk Grade-II and posted them as Sheristadar in the
Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Kujanga and Jagatsinghpur
respectively, which are within Jagatsinghpur Judgship. They made
representation for their retention in the judgeship of Cuttack but the
same was not considered. Since the action of the learned District Judge,
Cuttack was arbitrary and without jurisdiction, the writ petitions are filed

                                    -3-
to declare their posting as Sheristadar in their respective places as
illegal with a further prayer to restore them in the judgeship of Cuttack
against available vacancies.
5.           SUBMISSIONS
             Mr.Kanungo, learned counsel for the petitioners in both the
writ petitions submitted that the bottom-up principle as circulated by the
General Administration Department in 1996 has not be adhered to while
the judgeships were separated. According to him, as per the bottom-up
principle, the senior most employees, who have given the first
preference in order to remain in the mother district, have to be allotted
the mother district and after first bifurcation, the second subsequent
preference should be acted upon. Since the petitioners are the senior
persons, their option ought to have been taken into consideration to
retain them in the mother district of Cuttack.
6.           Mr.Kanungo, learned counsel for the petitioners further
submitted that after separation of the judgeships of Kendrapada,
Jagatsinghpur and Jajpur, learned District Judge, Cuttack, opposite party
no.2 has no administrative control to promote the petitioners to the
cadre of Bench Clerk Grade-II and post them to their respective places
outside the divided Cuttack Judgehship. So, he submitted that neither
the bottom-up principle was followed nor the opposite party no.2
exercised jurisdiction legally. Hence, he challenged the action of the
opposite party no.2 in posting the petitioners at their respective places

                                      -4-
at Jagatsinghpur and further prayed to direct for their posting according
to their exercised option.
7.           Mr.Amit Kumar Pattanaik, learned Additional Government
Advocate submitted that the bottom-up principle has been followed as
far as practicable because the guiding factor of the said principle is that
the authorities would consider the vacancies in the relevant grades of
the assignment of the employees to the cadre of mother district and also
as far as practicable, the options of employees would be taken into
consideration. Further, he submitted that on 17.05.2013, meeting of the
Departmental Promotion Committee (in short “DPC”) was held and the
DPC has cleared the names of these petitioners to be promoted to the
post of Bench Clerk Grade-II although the order of promotion was issued
on 24.06.2013. Since on the date of separation, they were promoted to
the cadre of Bench Clerk Grade-II, the promotion and posting cannot be
said as illegal. Moreover, he submitted that even if on 17.05.2013, the
districts were separated but due to time taken for completion of process
of deployment, the order of promotion and posting were issued.
Therefore, there is no illegality in promoting and posting the petitioners,
so also, there is no illegality in rejecting the option of the petitioners to
be retained in the mother district of Cuttack.
8.           POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION
             The main point for consideration is as to whether the posting
of the petitioners at Kujanga and Jagatsinghpur is liable to be quashed
and they are liable to be restored in the judgeship of Cuttack?

                                   -5-
9.          DISCUSSIONS
            It is admitted fact that both the petitioners were initially
appointed in the undivided judgeship of Cuttack before the new
judgeships Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur and Jajpur were created. It is not
in dispute that on 17.05.2013, the district separation was effected
where Jagatsinghpur judgeship was created. It is also not in dispute that
the petitioners were promoted to the cadre of Bench Clerk Grade-II and
posted as Sheristadar in the Court of the learned Civil Judge (Senior
Division) at Kujanga and Jagatsinghpur by virtue of the order dated
24.06.2013 passed by the learned District Judge, Cuttack, opposite
party no.2.
10.         It is also admitted fact that both the petitioners before
bifurcation of the judgeship were asked to give their options and they
have been given their options to be retained in the judgeship of Cuttack.
Learned counsel for the petitioners took the plea that the bottom-up
principle as envisaged as per the circular of 1996 of the General
Administration Department has not been adhered to while their options
were considered. On the other hand, Mr.Pattanaik, learned Additional
Government Advocate submitted that such guidelines of General
Administration Department vide Office Memorandum No.31775/SC/6-
73/96/Gen dated 13.12.1996 was followed by distributing the staff
between the mother judgeship and the bifurcated judgeship and there is
no discrimination with the petitioners for their deployment in the newly
created judgeship of Jagatsinghpur.

                                          -6-
11.          For the benefit of the parties, relevant portion of the Office
Memorandum No.31775/SC/6-73/96/Gen dated 13.12.1996 issued by
the General Administration Department, which is very much admitted by
both the parties to have been pressed into service to decide the issue in
question is reproduced below:
                              “No.31775-SC/6-73/96-Gen.
                                GOVERNMENT OF ORISSA
                       GENERAL ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT
                                  OFFICE MEMORANDUM
                                  The 13th December, 1996
             Subject- Guidelines for re-deployment of surplus staff of
             mother district to the newly created districts on re-organization.
                     The re-organization of the districts in the State has
             inevitable rendered a lot of staff surplus in the mother districts,
             not only in the Collectorate but also in the various district
             offices. It has been decided by the Government that different
             categories of posts created in the new districts on re-
             organization shall be filled up by deployment of the staff
             rendered surplus in the mother districts. In order to regulate
             the deployment of surplus staff, the Revenue and Excise
             Department in their letter No.42820, dated 21st September,
             1993 read with letter No.39900, dated the 5th September, 1994
             have issued the guidelines and action accordingly has already
             been taken by the concerned authorities in most of the
             districts. The guidelines by Revenue and Excise Department
             may have no binding effect on all the district offices of various
             Departments.
             Xx      xx      xx     xx
             2.4. As far as practicable and subject to the vacancies available
             in the relevant grades the assignment of the employees to the
             cadre of the mother district or the cadres of the newly created
             districts may be made on the basis of the position in the
             gradation list of the original district cadre taking into account
             their preferences. To illustrate, if there are 15 vacancies in a
             cadre in a district and 30 employees have given their first
             preference for the district, the senior-most 15 employees of the
             30 will be allotted to the district. Having exhausted the first
             preference, the second and subsequent preferences may be
             acted upon in that order.
             Xx      xx      xx     xx
             2.6. If all the vacant posts in a cadre of the districts, carved out
             of the mother district, cannot be filled upon on the basis of the
             preferences as above, the posts shall be filled up by the

                                         -7-
            following the “bottom up” principles subject to the following
            exceptions:-
            (i)     The widow or any other female member of the family of
            a deceased or disabled Government Servant who has been
            appointed under the rehabilitation assistance scheme may be
            allowed to continue in the mother district unless she pre
            prefers to be assigned to some other district carved out of the
            mother district.
            (ii)    An employee who had come on transfer to the cadre of
            the mother district from another district by forgoing his/her
            seniority in pursuance of General Administration Notification
            No.28949, dated the 15th July, 1992 and Resolution No.18380,
            dated 26th August 1993 may be allowed to continue in the
            cadre of mother district unless he/she prefers to be assigned to
            some other district carved out of the mother district.
            (iii)   The employees, whose son/daughter is/are already
            enrolled in a school for blind, deaf, dumb or mentally retarded,
            may be allowed to continue in the cadre of mother district, if
            similar instructions are not available in the other newly created
            districts. The proof of admission and continuance of studies of
            their children in such institutions shall be produced by the
            employees for the satisfaction of the cadre controlling
            authority.

            From the aforesaid Office Memorandum issued by the
General Administration Department for re-deployment of the surplus
staff of mother district to the newly created districts on re-organization
of the district have been issued on 13.12.1996 by superseding the
earlier circular issued in 1994. Clause 2.4 of the aforesaid Office
Memorandum        dated    13.12.1996       has    been     well   echoed    by the
petitioners. Such clause has got also exception in certain cases as
enumerated in Clause 2.6. However, clause 2.4 states that as far as
practicable and subject to the vacancies available in the relevant grades,
the assignment of the employees to the cadre of the mother district or
the cadres of the newly created districts is crucial clause because the
employer has to keep it in mind the vacancies available on different

                                        -8-
dates and the authority would consider the option to be retained the
employees in the mother district as far as possible. The aforesaid Office
Memorandum does not disclose that the option of the parties must be
carried out in all cases. On the other hand, the authority has got right to
consider the representations showing option given by the petitioners.
12.          The Additional counter affidavit has been filed by the
opposite party no.2. Paragraph-4 of the said additional affidavit is placed
below for better reference:
             “4.That in reply to the averments made in Paragraph-2 of
             rejoinder, it is humbly submitted that keeping in view the
             opening of new Judgeship the process of promotion was already
             started to fill up the estimated vacancies in different
             promotional posts of the undivided Judgeship including that of
             the District Judge, Jagatsinghpur and the Court of CJ (SD),
             Kujang prior to the date of separation of the Judgeship. As per
             resolution of the District Promotion Committee dated
             17.05.2013, only 15 employees have been recommended to
             the promoted to the post of Bench Clerk Grade-II out of the
             total estimated vacancy of 20.
                     A Xerox copy of the resolution of the District Promotion
             Committee dated 17.05.2013 is annexed herewith as
             Annexure-A/2.
                     The deponent further humbly submits that there were
             41 posts of Bench Clerk Grade-II for the un-divided judgeship
             at the time of separation of judgeship, out of which 28 posts
             were for Cuttack Judgeship and 13 posts for Jagatsinghpur
             Judgeship but only 36 employees in the said posts were
             available at the time of deployment of staff. The remaining 5
             vacancy as to the total sanctioned strength was approximately
             12.195% the proportionate vacancy as to 13 posts has been
             kept vacant and 11 employees in the said post were deployed
             there. In the above premises, even if all the vacancies would
             have been filled up, the petitioner must have come under the
             “bottom up” principle. It may further be submitted that since
             promotion was taken up as per resolution of the Promotion
             Committee dated 17.05.2013, which was effected vide order
             No.110 dated 24.06.2013, there was no scope to consider the
             vacancies occurred after 17.05.2013.”
             In the aforesaid paragraph of the additional counter affidavit
of the opposite party no.2, it is candidly admitted by the said opposite
party that the bottom-up principle has not been followed and although

                                   -9-
there were 13 posts of Bench Clerk Grade-II in the judgeship of
Jagatsinghpur made available and Annexure-C/2 clearly shows that this
Court has sent letter on 14.05.2013 to the learned District Judge,
Cuttack   for  opening   of  separate   judgeship   at Jagatsinghpur     on
17.05.2013. Learned District Judge, Cuttack, opposite party no.2 took
up DPC on 17.05.2013 and gave promotion to the petitioners. When the
opposite   party  no.2   came   to  know    that  separate  judgeship    at
Jagatsinghpur is going to be opened on 17.05.2013, he ought not to
have hurriedly held the DPC on the very same day, i.e., on 17.05.2013
and gave promotion to the petitioners to the cadre of Bench Clerk
Grade-II and posted them against their option in the judgeship of
Jagatsinghpur. It is also admitted in the additional counter affidavit that
even if the separation of judgeship was ordered by the Court, it took
some time to complete the process. There is no doubt over the
submissions because even after bifurcation of the judgeship, the process
of separation takes time to take a shape. But in the instant case, holding
of DPC on the very same day of separation of judgeship and after
promotion to the concerned employees again issuing the order on
24.06.2013, which is much after the separation of the judgeship do not
appear to be legal and proper.
13.         Besides, Annexure-D/2, which is the deployment order after
separation shows that these petitioners, after being promoted, have
been placed as Sheristadar in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior
Division at Kujanga and Jagatsinghpur respectively. But there is nothing

                                  - 10 -
found from the order as to why their options are not considered. On the
other hand, from the same order, it appears that Smt. Harapriya
Behera, Sridhar Sarangi and Pratap Kumar Barik, who are at serial
nos.10, 11 and 12 of said Annexure-D/2, have been retained in the
judgeship of Cuttack as per their option. It must be remembered that
every administrative order must be preceded with reasons. When there
is no reason for the deployment of the petitioners in the newly created
judgeship of Jagatsinghpur against their option, the reasons should have
been maintained by the learned District Judge, Cuttack, opposite party
no.2. Either the opposite party no.2 has not applied his mind to the fact
of the case or the options have been conveniently ignored. It is true that
for administrative ground, transfer can be made but when there is
already provision for option to be exercised, rejection of the same must
be supported with reasons.
14.         In terms of the above discussion, we are of the view that the
deployment of the petitioners in the judgeship of Jagatsinghpur is liable
to be quashed. Non-consideration of the options of the petitioners and
consideration of some options exercised by some other employees would
amount to violation of the principle of natural justice. The point is
answered accordingly.
15.         CONCLUSION
            It has been prayed in both the writ petitions to declare the
deployment    and   posting  of  the  petitioners  in  the   judgeship  of
Jagatsinghpur as Sheristadars as illegal and arbitrary and it has been

                                        - 11 -
   further prayed to restore them in the judgeship of Cuttack as per their
   option.
   16.           In the writ petitions, the petitioners have stated that they
   have been promoted but deployment with posting in the judgeship of
   Jagatsinghpur was against their option. They have not challenged their
   promotion. So, the question of their promotion on 17.05.2013 when the
   judgeship was separated cannot be set aside. Hence, we are of the view
   that the order and posting as per order dated 24.06.2013 is liable to be
   quashed to such extent and the Court do so. In the result, we hereby
   direct the learned District Judge, Cuttack, opposite party no.2 to pass
   necessary order of posting of the petitioners in the present judgeship of
   Cuttack within a period of four weeks from the date of communication of
   this order in accordance with law. It is made clear that learned District
   Judge, Jagatsinghpur shall relieve the petitioners immediately after
   receipt of orders from opposite party no.2.
                 The writ petitions are disposed of accordingly.
                 Requisites for communication of this order shall be filed
   within a week.
