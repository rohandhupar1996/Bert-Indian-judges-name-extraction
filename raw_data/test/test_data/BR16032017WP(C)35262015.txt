       PRESENT:-
           THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH
       Date of hearing : 08.03.2017          Judgment : 16.03.2017
Biswanath Rath, J.        This writ petition has been filed by the
       petitioners seeking setting aside of the orders dated 17.9.2014
       issued by O.P.2, Director, Biju Pattnaik International Airport
       under    Annexure-2    series and further     issuing necessary
       direction to prohibit the O.P.2 from forcibly taking away the

                                 2
private lands of the petitioners and others residing in Bhimpur
Mouza in Bhubaneswar.
2.                 Assailing   the    impugned     orders,  the
petitioners claiming to be the residents of Bhimpur Mouza
adjacent to Biju Pattnaik International Airport since 1994
made request to the Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary and
other dignitaries of the State to provide a 10 feet wide road
connecting Bhimpur Mouza from the Airport gate till Kine
House. While the matter was pending consideration of the
appropriate authority, considering substantial increase of the
residents in the locality, an amended request was made to the
Government for providing at the minimum a 30 feet wide road.
It is claimed, the State Government after considering the
difficulties of the residents was pleased to alienate an area
measuring Ac.1.506 pertaining to Khata No.740, Plot Nos.454
and 466 under Mouza-Bhimpur in favour of the Airport
Authority and in lieu of that area, the Airport Authority also
surrendered equal extent of land pertaining to Khata No.746
Plot Nos.698, 699, 729, 1004, 285, 296 & 297 in Mouza-
Bhimpur measuring an equal extent of area of Ac.1.506 for
utilization of the local public as public road of 30 feet wide
subject to condition that the Airport Authority shall develop
and construct the road at their own cost. The petitioners

                                 3
claimed that they along with other local public are already
enjoying 10 feet wide Government road along with another 10
feet wide from private land as has been assigned by the private
recorded land owners. Involving a dispute with regard to the
measurement and demarcation, the petitioners made G.A.
Department and the Director of Estate several times and the
Authorities after visiting the area along with the R.I. and Land
Officers and after discussing with the local residents sought for
demarcation of the land to find out the 10 feet land, as claimed
to have been provided by the vendors to the petitioners
through their sale deed with reference to Sabik and Hal Map
through the field staff of the Tahasildar involving sale deeds in
order to find out the actual position of the road.
                   It is alleged that in spite of adhering to the
decision of the Special Secretary, G.A. Department, Orissa and
in clear ignorance of the documents produced by the
petitioner, a fabricated map was prepared in order to deprive
the present petitioners along with the local public of Bhimpur
Mouza. The petitioners moved a writ petition in their first
attempt, vide W.P.(C) No.10169/2014, this Court disposed of
the same on 28.5.2014 directing the competent authority to
consider the grievance of the petitioners therein within a period
of three months from the date of communication of this order.

                                 4
Another set of persons including some of the petitioners filed
another writ petition, i.e., W.P.(C) No.12192/2014, which
matter was disposed of on 11.8.2014 again directing the
Director of Biju Pattnaik International Airport Authority to
dispose   of   the   representation   submitted  by   them.   The
representation was disposed of by the O.P.2 observing that
there is no illegal construction of the boundary wall by Airport
Authority and the construction has been undertaken on
appropriate demarcated line made by the G.A. Department
after carving out 20 feet width land corresponding to an area of
Ac.1.506, as per their letter dated 18.8.2006. It is claimed that
there already existed a road constructed by the Bhubaneswar
Municipal Corporation prior to handing over the land to the
Airport Authority by the G.A. Department.
                    It is further alleged that though the O.P.2
started a constructed work on a 40 feet road from Kine House
but while approaching towards Bhimpur Mouza, they are now
trying to forcefully take away the 10 feet private land of the
petitioners including that of the private land of more than 50
residents of the locality with an intention to develop 30 feet
wide road following their promise. The petitioners’ complain to
the competent authority including the Airport Authority did not
make any improvement in the situation, on the other hand the

                                 5
Airport Authority taking help of a large number of police
attempted to have the construction taking away the petitioners’
land compelling the petitioners to file the present writ petition
seeking direction, as indicated herein above.
3.                  Referring to several documents enclosed
along with the writ petition and the interim order passed by
this Court facilitating a fresh measurement of land by its order
dated 26.2.2015, Sri Ashok Mohanty, learned senior counsel
appearing for the petitioners, strenuously urged that even
though a demarcation process has been undertaken but since
the demarcation process did not follow the direction of this
Court in true spirit and there has been no application of hal
status of the land involved therein, alleged that a demarcation
report has been prepared to benefit the opposite parties and
with a deliberate intention to deprive the permanent residents
in the locality from their right over particular land. It is also
alleged that since the lands included in the road project
belonging to the petitioners with the support of registered sale
deeds, their private lands cannot be utilized for road purpose
unless and until there is acquisition under the statute meant
for the same by the competent authority and the action of the
public authorities alleged to be absolutely illegal and contrary
to the provision of law. It is under the circumstance, Sri

                                 6
Mohanty, learned senior counsel for the petitioners, submitted
that   the  public   authorities   should   be   prohibited  from
undertaking their ill-designed action and also prevented from
depriving the petitioners from their right over their won lands.
4.                 Pursuant to the notice, O.P.1 filing counter
affidavit challenging the maintainability of the writ petition on
the premises that the writ petition involves disputed questions
of facts also contended that the petitioners are in the habit of
moving this Court again and again for no lawful reason. In
spite of this Court’s direction for measurement/demarcation
involving the petitioners and the measurement process though
undertaken involving the petitioners, the petitioners finding the
factual position against them refused to sign the demarcation
proceeding. It is asserted that there has been an appropriate
demarcation proceeding not only involving the parties but also
taking into consideration all the information available and the
documents connecting the locality. Thus, while justifying the
report prepared for the purpose submitted that there is no
wrongful deprivation to the petitioners from their land and the
allegation that the O.P.2 is forcibly taking away the private
lands of the petitioners is out and out false and also contrary
to the materials available on record.

                                 7
5.                 Referring to the detailed counter affidavit, Sri
V.Narasingh, learned counsel for O.P.2, on allegation that there
has been illegal diversion of petitioners’ lands by the O.P.2,
contended     that  the   demarcation     proceeding   has   been
undertaken taking into consideration the relevant records
available involving the particular area and the lands. For the
time and again direction of this Court for considering the
petitioners’ grievance, the matter has also been taken up with
due care and caution. It is alleged that the previous attempt for
demarcation was deliberately obstructed by the petitioners.
However, following the interim direction of this Court, a fresh
demarcation process has already been undertaken finding the
claim of the petitioners false and under the circumstance, Sri
Narasingh, learned counsel for O.P.2, contended that the writ
petition firstly is not maintainable for the involvement of
disputed question of fact and secondly, the claim of the
petitioners runs contrary to the land particulars and materials
available with the Revenue Authority.
6.                 Sri S.P.Mishra, learned Advocate General for
the State referring to the counter affidavit of the State, O.P.1,
the yadast and draft R.O.R. submitted that the claim of the
petitioners that there has been illegal diversion of the
petitioners’ lands is not only contrary to the records available

                                  8
with the Revenue Authority but for the involvement of the
disputed questions of fact, no adjudication of the dispute
involved is possible in exercise of power under Article 226 or
227 of the Constitution of India, further referring to the fresh
demarcation undertaken following the interim direction of this
Court submitted that there has been a clear indication of the
actual fact supporting the case of the Government as well as
the Airport Authority and the demarcation undertaken in
presence of the petitioners even though signed by several local
people but the petitioners refused to sign on the false pretext.
Under the above premises, Sri S.P.Mishra, learned Advocate
General,   while    claiming    that an   important    assignment
involving security of the Airport at Bhubaneswar is being
delayed for the illegal attempt of the petitioners and thus, while
requesting for dismissal of the writ petition urged for vacation
of the interim order and permitting the O.Ps. to proceed with
the construction of the compound wall of the Airport and also
for making available of the road provision in the locality.
7.                  Considering the rival contentions of the
parties and on scan of the pleading in the writ petition, this
Court   finds,   the    petitioners’ claim    runs   through  the
information available in sale deeds running in their favour.
There is dispute with regard to the starting point and end point

                                 9
involving    a  road   construction    in  the   local  when  the
Government Authority and the Airport Authority claim that
there has been appropriate measurement and construction of
the compound wall as well as the road is being made following
the proper measurement and based on the information
available through the land records. Considering the rival claim
of the parties at an earlier occasion by way of interim direction
dated 26.2.2015, this Court in this writ petition passed the
following order :-
                    “As an interim measure, it is directed
        that the General Administration Department-
        opposite party no.1 is to take a fresh
        measurement in presence of the concerned
        villagers including the petitioners involving the Air
        Port Authority and submit a report on the next
        date. Further, it is directed that fresh
        measurement will be conducted taking into
        account the Sabik map of the locality.
                    In view of the urgency in the matter
        and keeping in mind the allegations made by the
        petitioners particularly on the aspect that their
        land is illegally going to be taken over b the Air
        Port Authority in connivance with the State
        Officials, this Court directs for maintenance of
        status quo by the parties in respect of the
        construction at the spot till next date.
 Following the direction dated 26.2.2015, this Court finds, the
Authorities have also entered into a measurement and
demarcation process in the matter of construction of public
road and the boundary wall of the Biju Pattnaik International

                                10
Airport at Bhubaneswar and from the report, this Court finds,
the following :-
                    “As per direction of the Hon’ble High
        Court dated 04.03.2015 in Misc. Case No.3560 of
        2015 the fresh measurement of the road land has
        been conducted on the basis of the sabik
        settlement (1953-54) map of mouza-Bhimpur. We
        have also measured some plots relating to the
        adjacent Mouza-Bhubaneswar on the basis of the
        sabik settlement map (1953-54) of Mouza-
        Bhubaneswar to identify the village boundary of
        Mouza-Bhimpur as the petitioner’s land is
        situated near by the village boundary of mouza
        Bhimpur. After due measurement of the land
        belonging to petitioner’s we have also demarcated
        the boundary line of the 30’.0” wide road land out
        of which 20’.0” wide road land was left by the
        Airport authority & 10’.0” wide road land belongs
        to State Government of Mouza-Bhimpur. After
        field measurement, it was found that the points
        on the southern side of the 30’.0” wide road land
        fixed earlier on the basis of the Hal settlement
        map (1988-89) of Mouza-Bhimpur, Unit No.22 is
        intact with the fresh measurement as per the
        sabik map (1953054) of mouza-Bhimpur. So the
        boundary line of the Airport land identified for
        construction of the public road and the compound
        wall of Biju Patnaik International Airport,
        Bhubaneswar is correct as per the Sabik as well
        as the Hal map of Mouza Bhimpur.
                    The trace map prepared on the basis of
        the sabik (1953-54) settlement map of Mouza-
        Bhimpur and Mouza-Bhubaneswar is enclosed
        along with the attendance of the persons present
        at the time of field measurement. The petitioner
        Sri Krutibash Mohanty and others have refused to
        put their signature on the attendance.”
Reading of the aforesaid observations in the report, this Court
finds, the measurement involving the dispute raised by the

                               11
petitioners  though    has   been   undertaken     involving  the
petitioners and the measurement has been taken up involving
both the hal settlement map as well as sabik map and even
though the report has been signed by several residents of the
locality, as appearing at Page-91 of the brief, showing their
attendance at the time of enquiry and signatures thereof as a
matter of mark of acceptance of the measurement/demarcation
report but the present petitioners though were present at the
spot but refused to sign the same.
8.                 Considering    the     discussions    in   the
measurement/demarcation       report,   this  Court   finds,  the
allegation of Sri Ashok Mohanty, learned senior counsel that
the measurement has been undertaken without taking into
consideration the sabik plot index runs contrary to the detailed
discussion therein. At this stage, this Court wants to refer to a
decision of the Hon’ble apex Court in the case of State of
Rajasthan vrs. Bhawani Singh & others reported in 1993
Supp (1) SCC 306. This Court finds, deciding the question of
maintainability of the writ petition for involvement of the
disputed questions of fact, the Hon’ble apex Court held that
the matter involving the disputed questions relating to title of
the parties over the land cannot be gone into adjudication in a

                                12
writ petition either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution
of India.
9.                 For the observations made herein above, for
the law of the land and particularly for the observations in the
demarcation report, this Court finds no scope for interfering in
the impugned action. Consequently, the writ petition stands
dismissed.
10.                For dismissal of the writ petition, the interim
order passed in Misc. Case No.3560/2015 stands vacated.
                                            …………………………
