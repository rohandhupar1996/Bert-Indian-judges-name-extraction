                THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE INDRAJIT MAHANTY.
                            Date of Judgment: 15.07.2014
I. Mahanty, J.      This application has been filed by the petitioner-M.D.N.
           Panicker under Section 14 read with Section 12 of the Contempt
           of Courts Act, 1971 against opposite party No.1-M.K. Panda,
           Inspector-in-Charge and opposite party No.2-Rupak Patnaik,
           Sub-Divisional Magistrate for non-compliance of the direction of

                                 2
this Court issued in CRLREV No.791 & 937 of 2010 disposed of
on 25.10.2010.
2.        It was asserted by the petitioner that after the aforesaid
order was passed, copy thereof was served on opposite party No.2
along with a letter dated 30.10.2010 and a similar copy was also
served on opposite party No.1 along with a covering letter, but in
spite of the said communication, the residence of the petitioner,
which was under the lock and key, had not been unlocked and
the petitioner had not been permitted or allowed to stay in his
residence i.e Qrs. No.D/81, Sector-18, Rourkela.
3.        Affidavits have come to be filed by both the Inspector-in-
Charge, Udit Nagar Police Station, Rourkela as well as the
Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Panposh, Rourkela. On perusal of the
same, it appears that opposite party No.1 on receipt of letter
dated 06.01.2011 from opposite party No.2 who claims to have
taken steps to hand over the keys of the quarters to the
petitioner on 07.01.2011 and since the petitioner was not
available at Rourkela on that day, the same could not be handed
over to him and the same was complied with on arrival of the
petitioner at Rourkela on 08.01.2011 when he was handed over
possession of the first floor of the disputed quarters. The opposite
parties have expressed their regret for the delay in non-

                                               3
               compliance of the Court’s order and pray that the compliance
               made, though belatedly, may be condoned keeping in view the
               long service career of the contemnors.
               4.       In view of the above, since the orders passed by this
               Court in CRLREV Nos.791 & 937 of 2010 disposed of on
               25.10.2010 have been complied with though belatedly, the
               apology tender is accepted and the proceeding stands dropped.
                                                      …………………….
                                                        I.Mahanty,J.
