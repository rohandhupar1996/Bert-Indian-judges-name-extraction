                                                    --------------------------
           PRESENT:
                                THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M. M. DAS
           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. Das, J.                    Election to the Office of Sarpanch of Odanga Gram
           Panchayat, which consists of 15 wards, was held on 15.02.2007. The
           petitioner was returned as the Sarpanch of the said Gram Panchayat
           in the aforesaid election. The election of the petitioner has been
           challenged by the opposite party in Election Misc. No.56 of 2007
           pending before the learned Civil Judge (Junior                       Division), Bhadrak.
           The grounds set forth in the election petition filed under section 31 of

                                     2
the Orissa Gram Panchayat Act, 1964 are that 12 numbers of votes
cast in favour of the election petitioner have been wrongly rejected,
three ballot papers one each in Booth Nos.4,5 and 7 have been
illegally accepted in favour of the writ petitioner, nine persons have
voted in Booth Nos.8 as well as Booth No.14 and similarly 5 persons
have cast their votes in Booth No.7 of Odanga Gram Panchayt as well
as in Booth No.1 of Chhyalsingh Gram Panchayat and such persons
were supporters of the writ petitioner, who was the opposite party in
the election petition. The petitioner on appearing in the Election Misc.
Case filed his written statement. After closure of evidence, the
opposite party filed a petition on 18.02.2008, inter alia, making the
following prayer:-
               “a)     That the counter foils of the ballot papers
                       issued to the votes of booth nos.7,8,11,13,14
                       of Odanga Gram Panchayat, who are
                       specifically mentioned in the election petition
                       be marked and the corresponding ballot
                       papers be taken off from the valid ballot
                       papers.
                b)     That the ballot papers counted for the
                       opposite party and rejected ballot papers be
                       inspected, scrutinized and recounted”.
 The petitioner filed his objection to the said application. Upon
 hearing on the application, the learned Civil Judge (Jr. Division),
 Bhadrak by his order impugned in the present writ petition dated
 29.03.2008 allowed the said application observing and directing as
 follows:-

                                       3
                          “In view of the above narration, I am of the
                 view that for the just decision of the case, prayer
                 made by the petitioner in respect of recounting
                 and inspection, recheck of ballot papers and
                 counter foil only is worth considering and as such
                 it is allowed.
                                 Put up on 17.04.2008 when both
                 parties/counsel are to be present in the open
                 court for recounting and inspection and recheck
                 ballot papers and counter foils as prayed”.
                The petitioner being aggrieved by the said order has
preferred the present writ application seeking quashing of the same.
Reliance has been placed on various decisions of the Apex Court as
well as this Court by the petitioner in support of his contention that
the circumstances did not warrant an order to be passed by the
Election Tribunal directing inspection and recounting of ballot papers
as has been done in the impugned order.
2.              Mr. R.K. Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner
relying upon the decision in the case of Vadivelu v. Sundaram and
others,    A.I.R. 2000 S.C. 3230 submitted that the facts of the
present case do not satisfy the prerequisites conditions where an
order for recounting/inspection of ballot papers could have been
passed. He submitted that as has been held by the Supreme Court in
the aforesaid decision as well as in the case of Baldev Singh V.
Shinderpal Singh and another, (2007) I SCC 341, to pass an order
for inspection/recounting of ballot papers, the Court must be
satisfied that a prima facie case has been established, the material
facts and full particulars have been pleaded stating the irregularities

                                  4
for counting of votes. He further submitted that the Supreme Court
held in the said case that a roving and fishing inquiry should not be
directed by way of an order to recount the votes and in the process,
the secrecy of the ballot papers should be guarded. A Division Bench
of this Court in Writ Appeal No.67 of 2008 (Narayan Chandra
Nayak Vrs. Harish Chandra Jena and two others) by judgment
dated 04.11.2008 taking note of a number of decisions of the Apex
Court as well as this Court, while dealing with a similar question
held that the Court has to strike a balance so that the purity of
election is preserved and remains unpolluted in order to achieve the
goal of democracy but at the same time the secrecy of the ballots
remains guarded. This Court further held that recounting can be
directed in exceptional circumstances where the Court comes to the
conclusion that the petitioner is not seeking a roving and fishing
inquiry, he has pleaded the material facts and adduced evidence in
support of his case and the returned candidate has failed to rebut
the same.
3.             Law on this question has been well settled and it has
been laid down that unless particulars with regard to illegality in
counting of ballot papers, rejecting the ballots papers as invalid etc.
have been pleaded in detail and evidence has been led in support of
such pleading making out a prima facie case, an order, for
recounting/inspection of ballot papers cannot be passed. In the case

                                       5
  of Harikrishna Lal Vs. Babu Lal Marandi, (2003)8 SCC 613, the
Apex Court held that the success of a winning candidate is not to be
lightly interfered with and the burden of proof lies on the one, who
challenges the election to raise necessary pleadings and adduce
evidence to prove such averments as would enable the result of the
election being set aside on any of the grounds available in the law.
The secrecy of the ballot must be zealously guarded. In the case of
R.Narayanan Vs. S. Semmalai, AIR 1980 SC 206, the Supreme
Court held that the fact that the margin of votes by which the
successful candidate was declared elected was very narrow, though
undoubtedly an important factor to be considered would not by itself,
vitiate the counting of votes or justify recounting by the Court. In
Vadivelu (supra), the Supreme Court while dealing with a case under
the Representation of People Act, 1951, referring to several earlier
decisions held as follows:
                         “The result of the analysis of the above cases
               would show that this Court has consistently taken
               the view that recount of votes could be ordered very
               rarely and on specific allegation in the pleadings in
               the Election Petition that illegality or irregularity was
               committed while counting. The petitioner who seeks
               recount should allege and prove that there was
               improper acceptance of invalid votes or improper
               rejection of valid votes. If only the Court is satisfied
               about the truthfulness of the above allegation, it can
               order recount of votes. Secrecy of ballot has always
               been considered sacrosanct in a democratic process
               of election and it cannot be disturbed lightly by bare
               allegations of illegality or irregularity in counting.
               But if it is proved that purity of lections has been
               tarnished and it has materially affected the result of
               the election whereby the defeated candidate is

                                     6
               seriously prejudiced, the Court can resort to recount
               of votes under such circumstances to do justice
               between the parties”.
After holding as above, the Supreme Court, analyzing the pleadings in
the election petition, came to a conclusion that the appellant therein
has not set forth material facts or particulars required for recounting
of votes, to justify his contention that there was irregularity or
illegality in the counting, except making some general and bald
allegations, no other details were found to be given in the pleadings.
In the said case though an allegations was made that electoral roll
contained the names of dead persons and the first respondent took
advantage of the same and some persons had impersonated and cast
votes in his favour, no details were given as to who committed such
irregularities. The appellant therein also did not mention as to how
many such votes were cast in favour of the first respondent and has
also not alleged the nature of illegality or irregularity said to have
been committed by the Counting Officer. It was also not specified as
to in what manner, there was improper acceptance of invalid votes
and improper rejection of valid votes. The Supreme Court, therefore,
concluded that the election petition is bereft of all details and the
appellant, when examined as P.W.1 cannot supplement anything by
way of evidence. Taking note of the ratio of several Supreme Court
judgments, this Court has also held in the case of Narayan Chandra
Nayak (Supra) that it is the solemn duty of the election petitioner to

                                      7
plead material facts. The case of illegal acceptance or rejection of
ballots has to be pleaded giving the serial numbers and the source of
information. Merely showing that petitioner’s agent had told him was
not enough. The name of the agent, who had furnished such
information was to be disclosed in the election petition itself and note
book on the basis of which such details had been furnished must be
produced. The above findings were arrived at, following the decisions
in the case of Jitendra Bahadur Singh Vs. Krishna Behari, AIR
1970 SC 276, M. Chinnaswamy Vs. K.C. Palanisamy & Ors. AIR
2004 SC 541 and Chandrika Prasad Yadav Vs. State of Bihar &
Ors., AIR 2004 SC 2036. In the present case, the election petitioner
pleaded the following facts in the election petition in support of his
plea that there was irregularity in counting of the votes.
                       “That during the process of counting the
           Presiding Officers of different booths illegally rejected 12
           nos. of votes cast in favour of the petitioner on flimsy
           ground of major portions of the cross mark being in
           symbol ‘sun’ and also that there have been marking in
           favour of more than one candidates there has been
           marking on symbols like Sun, Plough and Umbrella in
           addition to the ‘fish’ symbol of the petitioner. It is
           humbly submitted that there has been only two
           candidates in the election for the post of Sarpanch of
           Odanga Gram Panchayat. For the whole State of Orissa
           there has been one set of ballot papers bearing six
           symbols as per the Orissa Gram Panchayat Election
           Rules. Names of the candidates are not printed on the
           ballot papers. The symbols of sun, umbrella, plough and
           ladder have not been allotted to the any candidates in
           the election for the office of Sarpanch of Odanga Gram
           Panchayat. These votes have been wrongly rejected
           though they should have been counted in favour of the
           petitioner.
                       That in three ballot papers, one each in
           booth nos.4, 5 and 7 have been illegally accepted in

                                      8
           favour of the O.P. though the major portion of the arrow
           cross mark is on the symbol ‘fish’. These three ballot
           papers should have been counted in favour of the
           petitioner but has wrongly been counted in favour of the
           O.P.
                         That by such illegalities the O.P. has been
           declared to have secured 1523 votes and the petitioner
           have been shown to have secured 1509 votes. In the
           event of correct and proper inspection of the ballot
           papers it would be seen that the petitioner has secured
           1524 valid votes and the O.P. has secured 1520 votes.
                         That 10 persons of Odanga Gram Panchayat
           have been enrolled as voters in both Ward Nos.11 and
           13. Similarly 7 persons have been enrolled in Ward no.7
           of Odanga Gram Panchayat though they are voters and
           inhabitants of adjacent Ganijanga Gram Panchayat.
           Coming to know about this, the agents of this petitioner
           as well as of other candidates contesting for different
           offices filed a written objection to the Presiding Officer of
           Booth no.11 of Odanga Gram Panchayat, praying him
           not to allow these voters to cast their votes in Booth
           no.11 as they have already exercised their franchise in
           booth no.13 of Odanga G.P. and in Ganijanga Gram
           Panchayat. A copy of the said application is being filed
           along with this petition. It is humbly submitted that the
           Presiding Officer of booth no.11 did not take any step
           against those voters as a result of which 10 persons
           have cast their votes in booth no.11 though they have
           already cast their votes in booth no.13 of Odanga Gram
           Panchayat. All of them have cast their votes in favour of
           the Opposite Party in both the booths.
                         That after the closure of polling the
           petitioner further came to know that 9 persons of
           Odanga Gram Panchayat have cast their votes in favour
           of the O.P. both in booth nos.8 and 14. Similarly, 5
           persons have cast their votes in booth no.7 of Odanga
           Gram Panchayat though they have also cast their votes
           in booth no.1 of Chhayalsingh Gram Panchayat. It is
           humbly submitted that all these persons are supporters
           of the O.P. and have been canvassing votes for the O.P.
           All of them have cast their votes in favour of the
           opposite party”.
4.           The pleadings, as quoted above, do not specify as to who
are the nine persons of Odanga Gram Panchayat, who have cast their
votes in favour of the opposite party in the court below (writ

                                   9
petitioner) both in booth nos.8 and 14 and similarly who were the five
persons, who have cast their votes in booth no.7 of Odanga Gram
Panchayat have also cast their votes in booth no.1 of Chhyalsingh
Gram Panchayat. The source of such knowledge of the election
petitioner has also not been disclosed in the pleadings. It has not
been specifically stated as to which are the 12 votes which were
illegally rejected though they were cast in favour of the election-
petitioner. No particulars have been mentioned with regard to the
alleged three ballot papers, one each in booth nos.4, 5 and 7 which
have been illegally accepted in favour of the opposite party in the
court below (writ petitioner). In the petition filed for calling for the
counter foils of the ballots papers issued to the voters of the booth
nos.7, 8, 11, 13 and 14 of Odanga Gram Panchayat and the ballot
papers counted in favour of the writ petitioner and the rejected ballot
papers for inspection, scrutiny and recounting, additional allegations
have been made which are not there in the election petition.
5.            Considering the pleadings of the election petitioner in the
touch stone of the ratio of the decisions of the Apex Court referred
above as well as the Division Bench decision of this Court in W.A.
No.67 of 2008 and also applying the ratio of the decision in the case
of Gajanan Krishnaji Bapat Vs. Dattaji Gaghobaji Meeha, AIR
1995 SC 284, it would be seen that the Election Tribunal has
considered facts which are beyond the pleadings of the election

                                    10
 petitioner and the and the direction issued in the impugned order
 that for the just decision of the case there should be recounting/
 inspection/rechecking of ballot papers and counter foils as prayed, is
 contrary to law as laid down. The learned Election Tribunal also
 without any basis has concluded that the allegation with regard to
 irregularity in counting of ballots papers has been vividly mentioned
 in the election petition. In view of such position, the impugned order
 dated 29.03.2008 passed in Election Misc. Case No.56 of 2007 under
 Annexure-1 cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly
 quashed. The Election Tribunal is directed to hear arguments of the
 parties and dispose of the election petition on the materials available
 on record within a period of one month from the date of receipt of this
 order.
 6.           The writ petition is accordingly allowed, but in the
 circumstances without cost.
                                          …………………….
