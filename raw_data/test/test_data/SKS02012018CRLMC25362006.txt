S. K. SAHOO, J.           This is an application under section 482 of Cr.P.C.
        filed    by     the     petitioner        Purusottam          Prusty      challenging         the
        impugned order dated 04.07.2006 passed by the learned
        S.D.J.M., Dhenkanal in I.C.C. Case No.120 of 2006/C.T. Case
        No.1540 of 2006 in taking cognizance of the offence under

                                    2
section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereafter
‘N.I. Act’) and issuance of process against him.
             The opp. party no.2 Dinesh Patnaik filed a complaint
petition in the Court of learned S.D.J.M., Dhenkanal alleging
commission of offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act against
the petitioner. In paragraph-9 of the complaint petition, it is
mentioned as follows:-
             “9.    List of documents filed:-
             (i)     Post dated cheque bearing No. 140404,
                     dt. 15.12.2005.
             (ii)   Deposit slip.
             (iii)  Intimation slip of U.B.I., Dhenkanal to
                     S.B.I., Evening Branch, Dhenkanal.
             (iv)   Letter    of  S.B.I., Dhenkanal,   Evening
                     Branch to the complainant.
             (v)    Pleader Notice through Regd. Post.
             (vi)   Receipt of Regd. A.D.
             (vii)  Acknowledgment duly received by the
                     accused.
             (viii) Any other found relevant at the time of
                     hearing.”
             The complainant filed the affidavit in chief as
provided under section 145(1) of the N.I. Act. The learned
Magistrate vide impugned order dated 04.07.2006 has been
pleased to hold that no document has been filed by the
complainant though the same has been mentioned in the

                                   3
affidavit. However, the learned Magistrate found sufficient prima
facie materials to issue process against the petitioner for
commission of offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act.
             In spite of valid service of notice on opp. party no.2-
complainant, none appears on his behalf.
             On perusal of the lower court record which was
called for by this Court, it appears that not a single document
which is mentioned in paragraph-9 of the complaint petition has
been filed.
             Learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Pravat Kumar
Panda contended that a case under section 138 of the N.I. Act is
mainly    based    on   documentary     evidence    and   when   the
complainant has mentioned regarding some documents in the
complaint petition on the basis of which he alleged commission
of offence by the petitioner but he has not filed the same, the
learned Magistrate without perusing any such documents was
not justified in coming to hold that sufficient prima facie
materials to issue process against the petitioner regarding the
commission of offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act is made
out and therefore, the impugned order should be quashed.
             It is not in dispute that the case of the complainant
is  mainly    based   on   the   documentary     evidence  which   is
mentioned in paragraph 9 of the complaint petition. It is also not

                                         4
in dispute that those documents were not brought to the notice
of the Court at the time of passing the impugned order. In a
case of this nature, the Court is required to go through the
documents          to    come     to a  prima   facie  opinion         regarding
commission of offence as well as issuance of process.
                 Thus I am of the view that the learned Magistrate
should not have passed the impugned order hastily without
verifying any such documents. Mere mentioning the documents
on the body of the complaint petition is not enough, in fact those
documents were required to be brought on record in accordance
with law even at the stage of taking of cognizance and issuance
of    process.       The     learned  Magistrate  after  perusal            of      the
documents could have come to a prima facie opinion regarding
the fulfillment of the ingredients of offence under section 138 of
the N.I. Act.
                 Therefore, I find sufficient force in the contention of
the learned counsel for the petitioner. Accordingly, the impugned
order dated 04.07.2006 stands quashed.
                 The CRLMC application is allowed.
                                                         .................................
