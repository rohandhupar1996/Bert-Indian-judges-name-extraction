                  HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                             C.M.P. No.981 of 2014
     In the matter of an application under Article 227 of the
     Constitution of India.
                                   -------------
     Tila Jena @ Tilottama Jena                      ….. Petitioner
                                      Versus
     Sukhi Jena and others                           ….. Opposite parties
                  For Petitioner   --    Mr.Maheswar Mohanty,
                                          Advocate
                  For Opp. Parties --     None
                                 JUDGMENT
     PRESENT:
                    THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
                 Date of Hearing & Judgment: :04.01.2017
DR.A.K.RATH, J. This petition challenges the order dated 1.8.2014
     passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr.Division), Puri in C.S.No.163
     of 2011. By the said order, the learned trial court rejected the
     application of the plaintiff-petitioner under Order 18 Rule 1 C.P.C.
     for a direction to the defendants to begin first.
     2.           One Indramani Jena instituted the suit for partition
     impleading opposite parties 1 to 3 as defendants. During pendency

                                   2
of the suit, he died, whereafter the petitioner and proforma opposite
party no.4 have been substituted. The case of the plaintiff is that
Halu Jena was the common ancestor of the parties. He has two
sons, namely, Kalu and Indramani (Plaintiff). Defendants are the
sons and daughters of Kalu. The suit schedule property originally
was the intermediary estate of one Mani Gopal Das. Halu Jena was
a tenant in respect of the suit land. After death of Halu Jena, his
two    sons   remained   in   possession    of  the  suit   land.  After
promulgation of the Land Reforms Act, the plaintiff filed OLR Case
No.2723 of 1974 before the Tahasildar, Puri for declaration of
raiyat along with his brother. The Revenue Officer-cum-Tahasildar,
Puri passed an order in favour of the tenant on 31.7.1975. But in
the order-sheet, name of the plaintiff was omitted. The order was
passed behind his back at the instance of Kalu Jena. He could not
challenge the same. However, he is in possession of the suit land
along with defendants. Though there is an amicable arrangement
between the parties, but there is no partition of the suit properties
by metes and bounds. Pursuant to issuance of summons,
defendants 1 and 3 entered appearance and filed a comprehensive
written statement denying the assertions made in the plaint. The
specific case of the defendants is that Mani Gopal Das was the land
owner of the suit property. He inducted Kalu Jena as tenant. Kalu
Jena was in cultivating possession of the suit land since 1962 and
was paying rent. In OLR Case No.2723 of 1974, Kalu Jena was
declared as a raiyat. The plaintiff has no semblance of any right,
title and interest in the suit property. It is further stated that Halu
Jena died in the year 1960 leaving behind his two sons, namely,
Kalu Jena and Indramani Jena and two daughters. After his death,

                                          3
there was a partition of ancestral property in the year 1961. The
defendant no.2 took the same stand in her written statement as
that of defendant nos.1 and 3. While the matter stood thus, the
plaintiff filed an application under Order 18 Rule 1 C.P.C. for a
direction to the defendants to begin first. The learned trial court
rejected the application.
3.            The sole question hinges for consideration before this
Court as to whether defendants shall begin first ?
4.            Order 18, Rule 1 C.P.C., which is hub of the issue, is
quoted hereunder:-
                     “1. Right to begin- The plaintiff has the right to begin
              unless the defendant admits the facts alleged by the plaintiff
              and contends that either in point of law or on some
              additional facts alleged by the defendant, the plaintiff is not
              entitled to any part of the relief which he seeks, in which case
              the defendant has the right to begin.”
5.            In Balakrishna Kar and another Vrs. H.K.Mahatab, AIR
1954 ORISSA 191, the Division Bench of this Court in paragraph-5
of the said report held as follows:-
                     “(5). It should therefore be borne in mind that the
              right to begin is not the same as the adducing of evidence in
              support of a party's case. There is a distinction between the
              two. It is open to the plaintiff to say that although he has the
              right to begin he may rest content with relying upon the
              averments made in the written statement and may say that
              he does not propose to adduce further evidence, but the
              plaintiff should make this statement before the defendant is
              called upon to adduce evidence. Unfortunately, the Court
              below has confused the issue and has called upon the
              defendant to open his case even before the plaintiff went into
              the box or testified to the truth of his story. We are clearly of
              opinion that the order of the learned Subordinate Judge is
              erroneous and must be set aside.”

                                    4
6.          In   Baidhar    Behera    and  others   Vrs.  Pranabandhu
Maharatha, ILR 1966 Cut.51, it is held that the rule in the first
instance enjoins an obligation of the right to begin on the plaintiff
but the same is subject to certain riders. When the controversy
usually starts between the parties as to who has the right to begin it
is incumbent upon the Court to decide the controversy. The
determination of the question as to which party has a right to begin
is an integral part of the hearing itself.
7.          In Chittaranjan Das Vrs. Janaranjan Das and others, 84
(1997) CLT 296, it is held that the plaintiff in all cases has the right
to begin, exception being that when the defendant admits the facts
and contends either in the point of law or on some additional facts
alleged by the defendants the plaintiff is not entitled to any part of
the relief which he seeks in the suit and in that event only the
defendant is to begin. The same view was taken in the case of
Smt.Manorama Chhotray Vrs. Sri Prafulla Kumar Chhotray and
another, 2014 (I) OLR-575.
8.          Admittedly, in OLR Case No.2723 of 1974, the Revenue
Officer-cum-Tahasildar, Puri declared Kalu Jena as raiyat. The
plaintiff asserts that he instituted the suit along with Kalu Jena,
but inadvertently his name was omitted. He could not challenge the
said order. The suit schedule property was the subject matter in
OLR Case. The plaintiff has to prove that he has instituted the OLR
Case No.2723 of 1974 along with Kalu Jena and the order of the
Revenue Officer-cum-Tahasildar, Puri is an infraction of the
principles of natural justice. In view of the same, the order passed

                                  5
by the learned trial court can not be said to be perfunctory or
flawed warranting interference of this Court under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed. No
costs.
