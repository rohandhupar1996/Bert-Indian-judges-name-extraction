       PRESENT:
                     THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE S.N.PRASAD
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Date of hearing and judgment: 05.05.2015
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S.N.Prasad,J.         Mr. Aurobind Mohanty, Central Government Standing Counsel
       submits that he has filed memo of appearance on behalf opposite parties 1 to
       4. Office is directed to trace out and bring on record.
       2.             The petitioner being aggrieved with the order dated 25.2.2003
       passed by the Inspector General, Central Industrial Security Force, Patna by
       which order of punishment of compulsory retirement has been confirmed by
       the regional authority has approached this Court.
       3.             Brief facts of the case is that the petitioner who was performing
       his duty    as Guard of C.I.S.F. Unit, NALCO, Damanjodi and detailed for „A‟
       shift duty from 0500 hours to 13 hours on 12.2.2001 at Plant main gate

                                        2
collected money from the incoming trucks illegally. When checked a sum of
Rs.130/- excess than the pocket money of Rs.10/-               was    found and
recovered.
4.            Accordingly, article of charge has been served on the petitioner
directing to face regular disciplinary proceeding by appointing an Enquiry
Officer. The petitioner has participated in the enquiry, witnesses have been
examined and cross-examined, Enquiry Officer has found the charge proved
against the petitioner and thereafter he referred before the disciplinary
authority.   The disciplinary authority after accepting the same has issued
certain show cause with the proposed punishment, petitioner has given reply
to the show cause and the disciplinary authority has not found satisfactory to
the show cause reply and thereafter order of punishment of compulsory
retirement was imposed upon the petitioner.
5.            The petitioner being aggrieved with the order passed by the
disciplinary authority, has preferred appeal before the Deputy Inspector
General, Eastern Zone and against the order of the appellate authority, the
petitioner preferred revision against the penalty of compulsory retirement from
service awarded by the       as provided under the statute and the original
authority has also confirmed the order of punishment vide order dated
25.2.2003, against which the petitioner has filed this writ petition.
6.            Grounds taken by the petitioner is that the order of punishment
is disproportionate to the charges. The enquiry officer has conducted enquiry
without appreciating defence of the petitioner and as such finding given by the
Enquiry Officer is perverse. It is submitted that on the basis of the perverse
finding, order of punishment will be vitiated in the eye of law.
7.            The Enquiry Officer without any eyewitness to the occurrence has
proved the charge against the petitioner, hence the order of punishment is
absolutely improper and is not sustainable in the eye of law.
8.            On the other hand the opposite party has supported the order
passed by the disciplinary authority on the ground that the memo of charge

                                         3
has been issued against the petitioner against serious allegation of commission
of corruption i.e. taking gratification from truck drivers and when pocket of
the petitioner was searched, amount more than Rs.10/- which is permissible
to a CISF personnel by way of pocket money, was found from the pocket of the
petitioner and as such article of charge has been issued against the petitioner
on the basis of such allegation.
9.            Regular disciplinary proceeding has been initiated against the
petitioner before the Enquiry Officer and the petitioner has been provided with
opportunity of hearing i.e. to make his defence, cross-examine witnesses, etc.
and thereafter the Enquiry Officer after appreciating the submission of the
petitioner, has found charge proved.
10.           The finding of the Enquiry Office was forwarded before the
disciplinary authority and after accepting it has issued second show cause
notice to the petitioner, the petitioner has given due reply to the second show
cause which has found to be dissatisfactory by the disciplinary authority and
thereafter as provided under Central Industrial Security Force Rules,2001 the
authority thought it proper to impose punishment of compulsory retirement.
11.           The authorities have taken lenient view while passing order of
punishment of compulsory retirement because            the petitioner will get
retirement benefits after order of compulsory retirement.
12.           The petitioner has preferred appeal and revision before the
appellate and revisional authorities, after appreciating defence of the
petitioner, has found that the disciplinary authority has taken decision in right
prospective.
13.           Further submission made by the learned counsel for the opposite
party submitted that concurrent finding of the disciplinary authority cannot be
challenged under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and sitting as
appellate authority to reappraise the evidence.         On the basis of such
submission, it has been submitted that the order impugned needs no
interference by this Court.

                                       4
14.           Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents
on record.
15.           Admitted fact in this case is that the     petitioner    has   been
awarded compulsory retirement from service by the disciplinary authority and
the same has been confirmed by the Inspector General, CISF.
16.           Memorandum of charge has been issued against the petitioner for
commission of taking gratification while on duty on 12.2.2001 at Plant main
gate from the incoming trucks illegally. On the basis of such allegation when
the petitioner‟s pocket was searched out it was found in his pocket excess
money of Rs.10/- which was permissible to keep by way of pocket money and
accordingly article of charge has been framed against the petitioner.
17.           The petitioner being found receiving illegal gratification while on
duty, an enquiry was directed to be conducted by appointing Enquiry Officer
before whom petitioner was directed to appear, petitioner had appeared and
put his defence. The Enquiry Officer has taken statement of witnesses before
whom the pocket of the petitioner was searched out and Rs.130/- was
recovered. While the witnesses have been given statement in presence of the
petitioner, which the petitioner has not objected, rather the petitioner has
admitted this fact of commission of omission, the Enquiry Officer on the basis
of the statements having been recorded by the witnesses, has found the charge
proved and thereafter the Enquiry Officer has forwarded         the same to the
disciplinary authority who after its acceptance has issued second show cause
notice to the petitioner which has been replied but not found satisfactory by
the disciplinary authority, the disciplinary authority has taken decision to
impose punishment of compulsory retirement.
18.           The petitioner being aggrieved with the order of compulsory
retirement has challenged before the appellate authority by raising all points
and the appellate authority has found the order of the disciplinary authority
against the petitioner, the petitioner preferred revision as provided under the
statute and the revisional authority has also found that the order of
compulsory retirement is not illegal.

19.             Now the question of interference by this Court under Article 226
of the Constitution of India is concerned, this has been answered by the
Hon‟ble Supreme court in the case of State of U.P. and others –vs- Raj
Kishore Yadav and another, reported in (2006)5 SCC 673 wherein at
paragraph-4 it has been held:
       “ xxx It is a settled law that the High Court has limited scope of
       interference in the administrative action of the State in exercise of
       extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
       and,therefore, the findings recorded by the enquiry officer and the
       consequent order of punishment of dismissal from service should not be
       disturbed. xxx”
                In the case of Panchmahal Vadodara Gramin Bank –vs-
D.M.Parmar, reported in (2011)15 SCC 310 at paragraph-18 Hon‟ble Supreme
Court held:
       “ As has been held by this Court in the recent decision in Punjab & Sind
       Bank v.Daya Singh, (2010)11 SCC 233, in which                   one of us
       (H.L.Gokhale,J.) was a party, as long as there are materials and evidence
       in support of the findings, the High Court cannot interfere with such
       findings in exercise of powers of judicial review under Article 226 of the
       Constitution of India. xxx ”
       In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh and another –vs- Man Mohan
Nath Sinha and another, reported in (2009) 8 SCC 310 at paragraph-15 the
Honble Supreme Court held:
       “The legal position is well settled that the power of judicial review is not
       directed against the decision but is confined to the decision-making
       process. The court does not sit in judgment o merits of the decision. It is
       not open to the High Court to reappreciate and reappraise the evidence
       led before the inquiry officer and examine the findings recorded by the
       inquiry officer as a court of appeal and reach its own conclusions. xxx”
       In    the   case    of    Avinash Sadashiv Bhosale v. Union of
India,reported in (2012)13 SCC 142 at paragraph-58 Hon‟ble Supreme Court
held :
        “ It is a settled proposition of law that the findings of an enquiry officer
        cannot be nullified so long as there is some relevant evidence in support
        of the conclusions recorded by the inquiry officer.xxx”

                                         6
               In this case, nothing is given which can suggest that finding of
the Enquiry Officer can be said to be unjust since based on some relevant
facts. Hence, relating to the ratio relied upon by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
as referred to above, it cannot be said that finding of the Enquiry Officer which
is the basis of imposing punishment upon the petitioner is improper.
20.            Here in this case, there are four concurrent findings, right from
the finding of Enquiry Officer up to the finding of the revisional authority. This
Court cannot sit as appellate court to prove the factual facts and to disturb the
fact finding that too in a case like corruption committed by the CISF constable.
21.            All the authorities have considered all aspects of the matter.
From perusal of revisional order this Court finds that all the 13 truck
drivers/helpers have given their statement/written complaints at their own
without compulsion in presence of the petitioner and the petitioner signed
thereon without any compulsion.
22.            Money was recovered by P.W.1 who is eyewitness of the incident
of taking money by the petitioner.
23.            Moreover, from perusal of the record and the order passed by the
revisional authority where finding given by the Enquiry Officer has been
discussed, it is settled that finding of Enquiry Officer cannot be nullified so
long as there is some relevant facts in support of the conclusion recorded by
the Enquiry Officer.
24.            In this case the authority has taken a lenient view against the
petitioner which cannot be said to be disproportionate punishment against the
petitioner rather it seems reasonable considering the length of service of the
petitioner.
25.            In view of the fact that the petitioner being a member of
disciplinary force has committed serious irregularities/misconduct of taking
gratification from truck drivers for the purpose of which he has been deployed

                                         7
in the main gate of the Corporation for checking and as such he has failed in
discharging official duty rather he has involved himself           in       getting
gratification.
26.            In view of the facts stated hereinabove, I find no reason to
interfere with the order impugned.
27.            Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed being devoid of merit.
                                                     ….…………………
