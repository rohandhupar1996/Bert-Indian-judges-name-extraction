PRESENT:
                 THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE D.Dash
   Date of hearing – 09.01.2017         :     Date of judgment – 25.01.2017
            By filing this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, the
appellants in RFA No. 48 of 2007 who are the unsuccessful plaintiffs of T.S.
No. 247 of 2001 in the court of learned Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Jajpur
pending in the court of learned Ad hoc Addl. District Judge (Fast Track),
Jajpur have called in question the order dated 7.3.2011 passed in the said
appeal rejecting their petition to stay further proceeding of the appeal till
disposal of OEA Lease Appeal No. 2 of 2007. For the purpose they had
sought for the aid of the provision of section 10 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, in the alternative the provision of section 151 of the Code.

                                         2
2.           Facts for the purpose may be          briefly stated as under:
             The petitioners as the plaintiffs have        filed the  suit  for
declaration of their right, title and interest along with those of their co-
owners and opp.party nos. 5 to 18 (defendant nos. 5 to 18) over the suit
land and for confirmation of their possession. They have also prayed for
further declaration that the settlement entry in the corresponding M.S.
ROR standing in favour of defendant nos. 1 and 2 be declared as void and
so also the order passed in OEA Lease Case No. 8261 of 1965-66.
             It is stated that the property in question was that of the
intermediaries namely, Adhar Chandra Banarjee and Sridhar Banarjee
representing their nominal Thakur Sri Joginnath Jew and Sri Gopinath
Jew. It is further stated that note of possession was there in favour of one
Govinda Prasad Bose who is the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners
and opp.party nos.5 to 18 in the C.S. record of the year 1928-29. It is next
stated that he had approached those landlords for lease of the land for
agriculture and horticulture purpose and the ex-landlords created tenancy
by accepting the rent and by way of attornment of their previous
possession. So Govinda Prasad Bose having come into the possession as
settled raiyat, it is said that he had acquired right of occupancy raiyat over
the same and as such remained all along in possession till his death
whereafter his successors including these petitioners, opp. party nos. 5 to
18 are in such occupation.

                                         3
             It   is  further   stated   that   the possession  of  the   land
having remained with them continuously for all these periods which has
although been peaceful, without any interruption and as of its owner, there
has also been acquisition of title by adverse possession. The petitioners
assert that the order passed in OEA Lease Case No. 8261 of 1965-66 does
not bind them and others and the occupancy right over the property which
they have acquired by virtue of the provision of sections 23 and 24 of
Orissa Tenancy Act is not taken away by the said order.
             The opp. party nos. 1 to 4 who are the contesting defendants
deny the claim of the petitioners. They state that the petitioners have never
remained in possession and have not acquired the right, title and interest
over the property either by adverse possession nor they have acquired
occupancy right by virtue of the provision of Orissa Tenancy Act. The trial
court dismissed the suit by finally answering the contentious issues
particularly holding that the petitioners and others (opp. party nos. 5 to 18)
have no right, title and interest over the suit land. In deciding the said
issue, the order passed in OEA Lease Case has been accepted as legal and
valid. Thus the trial court within its competency, jurisdiction and power as
that of the civil court has refused to interfere with the same.
3.           The unsuccessful plaintiffs as the appellants had filed the suit
in the year 2001 which stood dismissed by judgment dated 7.7.2007
followed by the decree. After disposal of the suit in that year this OEA
Appeal has been filed challenging the vesting and consequential order

                                        4
standing in favour of the opp. party nos. 1 to 4. Thereafter, it having been
projected in the first appeal filed by the petitioners under section
96 of the Code as the ground to stay of further proceeding of the said first
appeal till disposal of the OEA Appeal, the lower appellate court has turned
down the prayer.
4.            Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel
for the opp. parties.
              I have carefully gone through the order which is the subject
matter of the present proceeding.
5.            Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that as on date,
the said OEA Appeal is pending and that according to him would decide the
fate of the claim of the petitioners in respect of the suit land as they claim
to have acquired the occupancy right over the same by virtue of their long
standing possession since the time of ex landlords with their consent.
According to him, since it is asserted that the order in the OEA case has
clothed the opp. party nos. 1 to 4 with right, title and interest in so far as
the suit land is concerned, thus when that order is under challenge having
been passed behind the back of the petitioners who are in possession of
land in question, the lower appellate court has erred in law by not staying
the proceeding of the appeal till disposal of that OEA Appeal in exercise of
inherent power under section 151 of the Code.
6.            Learned counsel for the opp. party nos. 1 to 4 vehemently
refutes the submission. According to him, the move itself is mischievous

                                         5
that when the suit remained pending for six years in the trial court, the
petitioners only after becoming unsuccessful in the       suit    have   taken
chance by filing the OEA appeal and this is only for the purpose of
protracting the litigation when the case that they have set out per se is not
acceptable and has been discarded by the trial court on appreciation of
evidence let in by the parties. It is his further submission that when even
for more than five years the first appeal has remained stayed by order of
this Court, the petitioners have taken no such step for disposal of the OEA
Appeal, for which it has remained pending as is now submitted. He
contends that if ultimately in the said OEA appeal, the petitioners became
successful, they would not stand deprived forever and can well get the fruit
of the said order as per law.
7.           The petitioners while filing the suit were well aware of the order
passed in the OEA lease case and their very case is that the same is not
binding on them. They have taken the chance of questioning that order in
the suit itself within the limited powers of the civil court which has been
decided by the trial court against them and that is laced for legal scrutiny
of the lower appellate court. So now after being unsuccessful in the suit by
filing an appeal, the very move to stay the first appeal on its face appears to
be unclean and its the purpose being for protracting the litigation is not
ruled out.
             Moreover, when they question the vesting of the land with the
State and consequential order in favour of opp. party nos. 1 to 4, the trial

                                             6
court has answered the question regarding their possession and that
now stands to be judged again in the first appeal through the legal
spectrum. The claim of the petitioners with regard to acquisition of title by
adverse possession having been answered against them, that is also again
before the lower appellate court for decision by reappraisal of evidence in
the touchstone of the settled position of law.
                  In view of the aforesaid, this Court does not find that by such
order passed by the first appellate court, refusing to stay the first appeal till
disposal of that OEA Appeal filed by the petitioners, there has occasioned
failure of justice or the same has led to miscarriage of justice warranting
interference in exercise of power under Article 227 of the Constitution.
8.                The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
                  No order as to cost.
                  Viewing the age of the appeal, this Court directs the lower
appellate Court to make all endeavour for expeditious disposal of the
appeal preferably within four months from 23.02.2017 on which date the
parties are directed to appear before the lower appellate court to receive
further instruction.
                                                       ..…………………..
