                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
               Heard Mr. P.P. Baruah, the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner. The respondents are represented by Mr. C.K.S. Baruah, the learned
Central Govt. counsel.
2.             A disciplinary proceeding was drawn up against the petitioner, who
was a Constable (GD) in the 131 Battalion of the CRPF, through charge memo
dated 02.09.1999 (Annexure-A). Under Rule 27 of the Central Reserve Police
Force Rules, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the “CRPF Rules”) 4 charges were
levelled and the substance of the imputation pertains to the Constable procuring
out living permission with the false pretext to meet with his wife Deepa Mishra,
who suddenly arrived from Bihar because of domestic problem. But it was found
later that he utilized the opportunity to spend time with one local lady Deepa
Deka at a hotel in Bongaigaon from 27.07.1999 to 29.07.1999. The lady in
question turned out to be a married lady with 2 children and had travelling from
Mangaldoi (Assam) and not from Bihar. The 2nd charge relates to the petitioner
leaving the camp area without obtaining permission to stay with the same lady at
a hotel in Mangaldoi from 21.07.1999 to 30.07.1999. Thus it was alleged that the
petitioner acted in a manner unbecoming of a member of a disciplined force and
thus he violated the provisions of Section 11(1) of the CRPF Act, 1949. The 3rd
and 4th charges pertains to desertion of the CRPF camp without permission, on
two separate occasions.
3.             An Enquiry Officer was appointed to examine the charges and the
delinquent Constable participated in the proceeding. His primary defence was
that the lady Deepa Deka was deserted by her husband Prafulla Deka and the
delinquent produced a marriage agreement dated 16.08.1999 to project that he
is married to the lady in question. Smt. Deepa Deka in her testimony before the
Enquiry Officer agreed that she was married to Prafulla Deka and 2 sons were
born out of that wedlock, but she alleged desertion by her husband. Then she
became acquainted with the Constable and they agreed to marry each other.
4.             Several witnesses were produced by the employer to prove that
the petitioner secured the out living permission by making a false representation
about his wife suddenly arriving from Bihar. The witnesses also proved that the
lady for whom permission was sought was not married to the petitioner and in
WP(C) 1404/2009                                                         Page 2 of 5

fact he was a bachelor. The so called marriage agreement dated 16.08.1999 was
executed on stamp paper of Rs.6/-, but this was not accepted by the Enquiry
Officer as the lady was still married and her marriage to Prafulla Deka was not
dissolved through due process. That apart the alleged incidents took place during
July, 1999, whereas the marriage agreement was executed on 16.08.1999 and
hence the defence version that the petitioner left the camp to meet up with his
married wife who purportedly came from Bihar was found to be unbelievable. As
the delinquent failed to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses and did not
produce any acceptable evidence to prove his innocence, all the 4 charges were
found to have been established and accordingly the Enquiry Officer gave his
report on 26.11.1999 to the disciplinary authority.
5.               The Commandant of the Battalion examined the enquiry report
and also the response of the delinquent to the enquiry findings. The disciplinary
authority concurred with the conclusion recorded against the delinquent and
after considering the gravity and the nature of the charges, ordered for dismissal
of the Constable, by invoking the power under Section 11 of the CRPF Act read
with Rule 27 of the CRPF Rules, through its order dated 18.12.1999 (Annexure-
C). An appeal was then filed against this order, but the same was dismissed by
the appellate authority on 08.08.2000.
6.               Earlier the petitioner had filed a writ petition before the Allahabad
High Court, but the same was withdrawn on 24.10.2007 and thereafter this
petition is filed in this Court of competent jurisdiction.
7.               Assailing the finding of the Enquiry Officer, Mr. P.P. Baruah, the
learned counsel submits that the delinquent was in a love relationship with the
married lady Deepa Deka, who was deserted by her husband and accordingly he
argues that the conduct of the petitioner should be construed in the appropriate
perspective. The learned counsel refers to the statement given by the lady before
the Enquiry Officer to project that Deepa Deka was divorced by her husband and
accordingly it is argued that she was free to marry the petitioner.
8.               But on the other hand, the learned Central Govt. counsel submits
that the previous marriage of Deepa Deka was not dissolved through due process
nor she could produce any evidence to show that she was free to marry the
delinquent. Therefore it is argued that no consideration can be shown to the
WP(C) 1404/2009                                                              Page 3 of 5

petitioner who secured out living permission under false pretext of his wife
suddenly arriving from Bihar for some domestic problem.
9.             The primary defence of the delinquent was that he met with his
wife Deepa Deka and to prove the marital status he produced the agreement
dated 16.08.1999. But the Enquiry Officer did not accept the marriage agreement
executed on Rs.6/- stamp paper as the lady had falsely declared herself to be
unmarried in the said agreement while she was still married to her husband
Prafulla Deka. Moreover, there was no formal divorce between Deepa Deka and
her husband Prafulla Deka.
10.            The proceeding of the departmental enquiry shows that adequate
opportunity was provided to the delinquent to prove his innocence but he failed
to prove the defence version that he left camp to meet his wife who suddenly
arrived unannounced from Bihar.
11.            But when the out living permission was secured by the petitioner
with a false pretext of meeting with his wife and he used the opportunity for the
tryst with a lady married to another person and taking note of the fact that the
petitioner was a bachelor then, it is abundantly clear that the conclusion reached
by the Enquiry Officer is a believable conclusion, as Deepa Deka was still to be
divorced from her husband. Moreover, the so called marriage agreement in the
stamp paper executed on 16.08.1999 can have no bearing on the marital status
of the two parties in respect of the incidents which occurred in the previous
month i.e. July, 1999.
12.            When a disciplinary proceeding is drawn up against an employee,
the standard of proof is preponderance of probabilities and some relevant
material to justify the conclusion reached by the Enquiry Officer and the writ
Court is not expected to act as an appellate authority to judge the merit of the
conclusion reached by the Enquiry Officer. Interference would be justified only
when there is procedural error leading to manifest injustice. But in the present
case, as earlier noted, the delinquent was afforded a fair opportunity to defend
the charges and the conclusion of the Enquiry Officer is based on relevant
evidence. In such circumstances, I find no infirmity with the enquiry proceeding
and the conclusion reached against the delinquent.
WP(C) 1404/2009                                                          Page 4 of 5

    13.            When the charges are analyzed in its proper perspective, it is
    apparent that the petitioner has made false representation to his superior, broke
    Rules, left camp without authorization only to spend time with a married woman
    and in this manner he committed serious breach of discipline. When such is the
    nature of the misconduct, it is natural for the employer to opt for severe
    punishment as it is a natural case warranting loss of confidence, by the
    employer.
    14.            For the above reasoning, I find no reason to interfere with the
    disciplinary proceeding and hence this case is found devoid of merit and the
    same is accordingly dismissed. No cost.
