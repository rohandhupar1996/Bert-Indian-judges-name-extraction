        PRESENT:
                  THE HONOURABLE KUMARI JUSTICE S. PANDA
                                          AND
                  THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI
         Date of hearing: 17.09.2013 |Date of judgment : 01.10.2013
Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.      The petitioner-Indira English Medium School, has filed
        this writ petition seeking to quash the order dated 29.5.2007 passed
        by the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar in D.R.No. 48 of 2001 & Alienation
        Case No. 25 of 2001 under Annexure-12, whereby the proposal for
        allotment of Ac.2.00 of land in favour of the petitioner-School has

                                    2
been dropped and also the consequential order of confirmation made
by the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar vide order dated 24.6.2011
passed in W.L.Appeal (OGLS) Case No. 27 of 2008 under Annexure-
16 on the ground that the same are arbitrary and unreasonable.
2.             The factual matrix of the case, in hand, is that, Indira
English Medium School, hereinafter to be referred as “petitioner-
School” is a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act,
which started an English Medium Public School at A.G. Square,
Bhubaneswar in the year 1990. In order to open a branch school at
Patrapada, the petitioner-School filed an application before the
Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar for grant of lease of Ac.2.00 of land under
the Orissa Government Land Settlement Act in respect of Khata No.
no.779, plot no. 441(P) measuring Ac.2.00 in mouza Patrapada in
the year 2001. On the basis of the said application, Alienation Case
No. 25 of 2001 was initiated and since de-reservation is required for
granting lease, De-reservation Case No. 48 of 2001 was started at
the instance of the petitioner-school for alienation of the same in its
favour.   It  appears   from    the  records    that  the   Tahasildar,
Bhubaneswar in D.R.Case No. 48 of 2001 and Alienation Case No. 25
of 2001 in Annexure-12 vide order dated 3.8.2001 directed the R.I.
Patrapada to report after conducting in depth enquiry on the
following points:

                                        3
          (i)      Whether the applied land is free of encroachment or
                   not?
          (ii)     Whether there is any forest growth of timber value
                   or not?
          (iii)    Whether the land is suitable for school building or
                   not?
          (iv)     Whether there is any public objection of the land is
                   alienated in favour of the school”
That as per the request of the record keeper the applied land
recorded as Gochar, the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar by order dated
11.9.2001 directed the R.I. Patrapada to start a De-reservation
proceeding and issue istahar inviting public objection in the locality/
G.P. by beat of drum to de-reserve as well as to alienate the applied
land in favour of the petitioner-School. On verification of the case
record, it is revealed that the kisam of the land, as applied for, is
Government Rakhit Khata No. 780, which has been recorded as
Gochar and De-reservation proceeding bearing No. 48 of 2001 has
been initiated. On verification of the area in question, it is found that
an extent of Ac.33.370 is required for the village against which a
total extent of Ac.204.991 of Goachar land is made available. Thus,
an extent of Ac.172.621 is found excess than the actual requirement
of the village and there is no bar to de-reserve Ac.2.000 dec. out of
the said Gochar land as per the requirement of the petitioner-School
in the said mouza and no objection had been received till that date.
It is also indicated in the said order that mouza Patrapada is one of

                                      4
the restricted villages out of 62 villages banned by the Govt. in
Revenue and Excise Department vide their notification No. 2864/R.
dated 14.1.1986 with a view to keep these lands reserved for
planned development in the Capital City. The Government in G.A.
Department vide their letter No. 8123 dated 26.12.1989 have also
restricted the mouza. However, the case of the petitioner may be
considered at the level of the Government keeping in view the above
restriction and necessity of opening an educational institution to
meet the need of the rural based persons. The field enquiry report
submitted    by  the   R.I.  Patrapada   vide  letter  No  429   dated
19.10.2001, reveals that Khata No. 780, Plot No.441 is recorded as
Gochar and the suit land is free from all encumbrances and there is
no forest growth over the plot and the land is suitable for house site.
Considering the above facts and circumstances, recommendation has
been    made   by   the  Tahasildar,   Bhubaneswar    by  order  dated
30.5.2003 for alienation of Ac.2.000 of land in favour of the
petitioner-School. On perusal of the record, it is revealed that the
Collector, Khurda has also intimated the Government in Revenue
Department vide letter dated 23.121.2002 stating that there is no
bar for grant of lease and there is also necessity of an English
medium school in the locality. Due to the delay caused by the
authorities, the petitioner filed a representation on 3.1.2003 to the
Hon’ble Minister, Revenue Department in consequence whereof, the

                                     5
Under Secretary to the Government requested the Collector, Khurda
to expedite the lease proposal vide letter dated 21.2.2003. However
in the D.R. alienation proceeding, certain defects were pointed out by
the Tahasildar vide order dated 13.6.2003 and accordingly, by letter
dated     20.6.2003,   the   Tahasildar,   Bhubaneswar    sought    for
clarification from the petitioner and in response to the same,
immediately the petitioner gave its reply on 21.6.2003. The Collector
intimated the Revenue Divisional Commissioner (C.D.), Cuttack
about the lease proposal and sent the entire case record for
consideration vide letter dated 10.12.2003. However, vide letter
dated    6.3.2004,   the  Revenue   Divisional  Commissioner   (C.D.),
Cuttack intimated the Revenue Department to waive the restriction
of the State Government to facilitate grant of lease. On consideration
of the same, the Government in Revenue Department requested the
Revenue Divisional Commissioner (C.D.), Cuttack to process the
lease proposal and submit before the Department for examination
vide letter dated 26.3.2004. Accordingly, the Revenue Divisional
Commissioner (C.D.), Cuttack submitted the lease record before the
Revenue Department for examination. However, on 12.10.2004, the
Revenue Department intimated the Revenue Divisional Commissioner
(C.D.), Cuttack that certain defects have been observed in the lease
proposal and therefore, returned the lease record for necessary
rectification.

                                     6
3.             At this juncture, the Orissa State Housing Board filed
requisition for alienation of Ac.2.441 dec. of land out of the same
Gochar plot no.441 of mouza Patrapada and accordingly, the
Tahasildar re-submitted the record to the Sub-Collector for kind
consideration and onward transmission to the Collector, Khurda. The
Sub-Collector vide letter dated 22.4.2006 stated that he has perused
the   compliance    of   the  Tahasildar,   Bhubaneswar     and     while
resubmitting the     proposal, he   has   mentioned    about   filing of
requisition of Orissa State Housing Board for alienation of Ac.2.441 of
Gochar land from Plot No.441. The Sub-Collector observed in order
dated 22.4.2006 that the Tahasildar being the manager of the
estate, should clearly mention whether the applied land of Orissa
State Housing Board is over the area (plot) involved in the lease
proposal and if so, what is the present position and accordingly, the
case record was returned to the          Tahasildar. The Tahasildar,
Bhubaneswar again by order dated 12.6.2006 stated that there were
total area of Ac.7.480 in Plot No.441 with kisam Gochar under Khata
No. 780 (Rakhit) of mouza Patrapada and vide order in D.R.Case No.
54 of 2002 an area of Ac.5.039 was de-reserved for alienation in
favour of Orissa State Housing Board and further vide order passed
in D.R.Case No. 48 of 2001 an area of Ac.2.000 were de-reserved for
eventual alienation in favour of the petitioner-School. Thus, an area
of Ac.0.441 is only available at present in plot no. 441. But the

                                    7
Orissa State Housing Board has filed a petition for alienation of
Ac.2.441 of land in its favour for implementation of social housing
scheme, which includes the land de-reserved for the petitioner-
School. The proposal of Orissa State Housing Board initiated in
W.L.Case No. 31 of 2005 (A) was submitted to the Sub-Collector for
onward transmission to the Collector, Khurda. As per the decision in
the meeting under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister, Revenue in
the presence of the Commissioner-cum-Secretary, Revenue and
Revenue Divisional Commissioner (C.D.), Cuttack the proposal for
alienation of Ac.2.441 of Govt. land in mouza Patrapada submitted
by the Orissa State Housing Board was processed and since the case
land relates to the proposal given by the petitioner-School, it was
directed to process the same in favour of the Orissa State Housing
Board in respect of the said land and so far as it relates to the
petitioner, the proposal was directed to be dropped vide order dated
29.5.2007. Finding no other alternative, the petitioner approached
this Court by filing W.P.(C) No.12527 of 2007 and vide order dated
4.5.2008 this Court directed that if the petitioner is so advised, he
may file an appeal before the appropriate forum within one week
along with an application for condonation of delay, which shall be
considered liberally and if the appeal along with the application for
condonation of delay is filed, then each of them be heard and
disposed of in accordance with law and if he is so advised, the

                                       8
petitioner may apply the appellate court for interim protection and it
is for the appellate court to consider the same strictly in accordance
with law and further directed that the interim protection granted by
this Court on 9.10.2007 in Misc. Case No.11552 of 2007 shall
continue for a period of seven days. With the above direction, the
said writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 14.5.2008. In
compliance to the same, the petitioner filed OGLS Appeal No. 27 of
2008 before the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar under the provisions of
the O.G.L.S. Act. Learned appellate authority, namely, Sub-Collector,
Bhubaneswar vide order dated 24.6.2011 in Annexure-16 declined to
interfere with the order of the Tahasildar taking into consideration
the following facts:
                “It is a fact that the application of lease by the
               appellant was processed upto the level of RDC(CD),
               Cuttack but it never got the sanction of the Government.
               On the contrary it was decided in a meeting chaired by
               the Hon’ble Minister, Revenue in presence of the
               Commissioner-cum-Secretary,        Revenue     and     the
               RDC(CD), Cuttack to accept the proposal for lease of
               Ac.2.441 of land in Mouza-Patrapada in favour of OSHB,
               Bhubaneswar as has been communicated to the
               Tahasildar vide Letter No. 756 dated 16.5.2007 of the
               A.D.M., Khordha. It is also true that the suit land was
               de-reserved by the Collector, Khordha with a purpose to
               sanction the said land in favour of the applicant. But
               lease attains finality only after execution of the deed
               between the lessor and lessee. The Government
               exercising the eminent domain can decline sanction of
               lease. As regards the question of limitation the order
               dated 14.5.2008 of the Hon’ble High Court in W.P.(C)
               No.12527 puts to rest the interpretation of limitation.”
4.             Mr.S.P.Mishra, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the
petitioner specifically urged that the application for grant of lease

                                      9
filed by the petitioner-School being earlier one, the subsequent
application filed by the Orissa State Housing Board for the very same
land should not have been entertained. Apart from the same, he
further urged that the appellate authority should not have dismissed
the appeal observing that although the lease proposal of the
petitioner was processed, the Government exercising the eminent
domain can decline sanction of lease and return the lease application
of the petitioner, and there is no illegality in the order of the
Tahasildar. As per the provisions contained in the Act, procedure has
been prescribed for settlement of Government land and power to de-
reserve the land and the purpose for which such settlement can be
done has been envisaged under the Government Land Settlement
Rules, 1983 and the same having been followed, the subsequent
dropping of the proceeding by the Tahasildar is vitiated and as such
steps taken by the petitioner-School is in furtherance of the directive
principles of State policy to make the provision for free and
compulsory education of children up to 14 years and for promotion of
educationally weaker sections of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes and other weaker sections of the Society. He contended that
when recommendation has been made for alienation of the land in
favour of the petitioner-School at the fag end due to interference of
the Hon’ble Minister in the meeting held under the Chairmanship of
Hon’ble   Minister,   in the   presence  of  the  Commissioner-cum-

                                       10
Secretary, Revenue Department and Revenue, Revenue Divisional
Commission (C.B), Cuttack, the proposal has been diverted to the
Orissa State Housing Board instead of the petitioner. That itself
indicates that there is arbitrary, unreasonable exercise of the power
by the authority, who has not been vested with the power under the
statute to do so.
5.             Mr.B.Bhuyan,     learned   Addl.   Government  Advocate
appearing for the State, vehemently urged that the action taken by
the authorities is well within their jurisdiction and competence and as
such, dropping of the proceeding is in conformity with the provisions
of law and also admits that on the basis of the decision of the
meeting held under the Chairmanship of the Hon’ble Minister,
Revenue and Disaster Management, Orissa on 1.5.2007, it was
decided to lease out the said land in favour of Orissa State Housing
Board and also stated that the necessity of leasing out the land in
question in favour of Orissa State Housing Board accorded the
priority compared to allotment of the same in favour of the
petitioner-School and accordingly, prays for dismissal of the writ
petition.
6.             Mr.Ashok Mohanty, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for
the Orissa State Housing Board, opposite party no.3 reiterated the
contentions raised by Mr.Bhuyan and also referring to the counter

                                    11
filed by the Orissa State Housing Board submitted that the
Government allotted Ac.5.039 dec. out of total area of Ac.7.480 of
land in mouza Patrapada under Khata No.778 and Plot No.441 on
24.3.2004 for implementation of Social Housing Scheme and since
the allotted area became insufficient for planned housing scheme due
to want of passage to the allotted area, the opposite party no.3 filed
an application to allot the balance Ac.2.441 dec. of the said plot for
compactness and contiguity of the area for planned housing scheme.
Referring to the decision of the high level meeting held on 1.5.2007,
he submitted that the Government decided to allot Ac.2.00 dec. of
land out of balance Ac.2.441 dec. in favour of the opposite party
no.3 and to retain Ac.0.441 dec. as Gochar. Mr.Mohanty again
brought to the notice of the Court that out of Ac.2.00 dec., Ac.0.450
dec. of land was required for construction of 4/6 lane road for AIIMS
at Sijua under Bhubaneswar Tahasil for which the Collector by letter
dated 7.6.2007 recommended the proposal of the Orissa State
Housing Board to the Revenue Divisional Commissioner (CB), Cuttack
for sanction of Ac.1.550 dec. out of Ac.2.00 dec. It is further urged
that the said land measuring Ac.2.00 dec. was badly essential to
ensure approach to the entire land of Ac.5.039 dec. as well as
compactness and contiguity of the said area as per Section 18(s) and
subsequent explanation enshrined in the Odisha Housing Board Act,
1968. According to Mr.Mohanty, equity stands in favour of supplying

                                     12
house accommodation to needy people than in favour of a school,
which intends to teach in English medium since dwelling house is
required for all the needy persons, but teaching in English Medium
School is not required for all. Therefore, he submitted that the claim
of the petitioner is not sustainable and accordingly, he seeks for
dismissal of the writ petition. That apart, he also argued that since
alternative remedy is available the writ petition should be dismissed.
7.              Admittedly, the petitioner filed an application for de-
reservation of the land in its favour, which has been registered as
D.R.Case No. 48 of 2001 and Alienation Case No.25 of 2001 for
allotment of Ac.2.00 dec. for its institution. On perusal of Annexure-
12, it appears that all through initiation has been taken by the
petitioner for allotment of Ac.2.00 of land in its favour and whenever
a query has been made, the same has been complied with and after
satisfying the conditions when the authorities competent was about
to allot the land in favour of the petitioner-School, at this juncture,
the Orissa State Housing Board intervened in the matter and though
Ac.5.039 dec. of land has been already allotted in its favour, the
Board sought for further allotment of Ac. 2.441 dec. of land, which
includes Ac.2.00 dec. recommended for allotment in favour of the
petitioner-School. But on the basis of the decision taken by the so-
called high level committee, recommendation has been made for
allotment of Ac.2.00 of land in favour of Orissa State Housing Board,

                                      13
which has been recommended earlier for allotment in favour of the
petitioner. Law is well settled that if the power has been vested on a
particular authority under the Statute, the same should be exercised
by the same authority and any higher or lower authority has no
jurisdiction to interfere with the same. The same view has also been
taken in L.Lavender & Sons Ltd. V. Minister of Housing and
Local Government, (1970) 3 All.E.R. 871 wherein it is held that a
statutory power conferred on a particular authority should be
exercised by that authority. Therefore, considering the above
proposition of law, the application for de-reservation as well as the
proposal for alienation has been considered by the Tahasildar and
recommended to the Sub-Collector in accordance with law and
thereafter to the Collector, but because of the so-called decision of
the high level committee, decision has been taken to drop the
proposal for alienation of land in favour of the petitioner-School and
to process the proposal for allotment in favour of Orissa State
Housing Board, which itself amounts to over-reaching the power
vested under the Statute and thus, such decision is vitiated. The
impugned order passed by the Tahasildar clearly indicates that in
view of the decision taken by the high level committee, he has
recommended for allotment of the land in favour of Orissa State
Housing Board and dropping the proceeding initiated in favour of the
petitioner. That very action of the authority being not in conformity

                                        14
with the provisions of law and any action taken pursuant to the
decision taken by the high level committee cannot be sustainable
inasmuch as the order suffers from gross material irregularities
committed by the authority vested with such statutory powers. Apart
from the same, in appeal though the judgment of the apex Court
reported in Mahabir Auto Stores and others v. Indian Oil
Corporation and others, AIR 1990 SC 1031 has been cited by the
petitioner and though referred to in its written note of submission,
the   same   has    not   been    taken   into   consideration  in   proper
perspective. On the other hand, the appellate court dismissed the
appeal   referring    to  the    phrase    “eminent     domain”    without
understanding the implication thereof. The question of “eminent
domain” came up for consideration by the apex Court in Jilubhai
Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1995 SC 142, which
reads as follows:
                “The right of eminent domain is the right of the
                sovereign State, though its regular agencies, to
                reassert, either temporarily or permanently, its
                dominion over any portion of the soil of the State
                including private property without its owner’s consent
                on account of public exigency and for the public good.
                Eminent domain is the highest and most exact idea of
                property remaining in the Government, or in the
                aggregate body of the people in their sovereign
                capacity. It gives the right to resume possession of the
                property in the manner directed by the Constitution and
                the laws of the State, whenever the public interest
                requires it. The term “expropriation” is practically
                synonymous with the term “eminent domain”.

                                       15
8.              Mr.S.P.Mishra,     learned   Sr.Counsel   appearing    for  the
petitioner cited the recent judgment of the apex Court in Laxman Lal
(dead) through LRS and another v. State of Rajasthan and others,
(2013) 3 SCC 764, wherein in para 15, the apex Court held as follows:
                “The statutory provisions of compulsory acquisition contained in
                the 1953 Act are not materially different from the 1894 Act.
                This Court has explained the doctrine of eminent domain in a
                series of cases. Eminent domain is the right or power of a
                sovereign State to appropriate the private property within the
                territorial sovereignty to public uses or purposes. It is an
                attribute of sovereignty and essential to the sovereign
                government. The power of eminent domain, being inherent in
                the Government, is exercisable in the public interest, general
                welfare and for public purpose. The sovereign is entitled to
                reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State
                including private property without its owner’s consent provided
                that such assertion is on account of public exigency and for
                public good.”
9.              In view of the aforesaid provision of law, dismissal of the
appeal by the appellate authority using the phrase “eminent domain” is
absolutely misconceived one.         Therefore, the impugned order dated
24.6.2011 passed by the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar in W.L. Appeal
(OGLS) Case No. 27 of 2008 under Annexure-16 confirming the order
dropping the proceeding initiated at the instance of the petitioner is
liable to be set aside.
10.             In the present context under the O.G.L.S. Act, even
though there is a provision for revision, but that ipso facto cannot take
away the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground of availability of
alternative remedy. In support of such position, Mr.Mishra, learned
Sr.Counsel relies upon the judgments of this Court in M/s.Crystal

                                    16
Towers v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Orissa and others,
1998(1) OLR, 14 (para-13), Sri Durga Construction v. Sales-tax
Officer, Ganjam II Circle, Bhanjanagar, 1998 (II) OLR 255 (para 6,7
8)   and   Rabindranath      Choubey     v.    Chairman-cum       Managing
Director, Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd., Sambalpur and another,
2013(II) OLR 400 (para-7), Sri Raghunath Jew and another v.
Commissioner of Endowments, Orissa and others, AIR 1990 Orissa
87 (para-8).
11.             The  Constitution  Bench     of   the   Supreme    Court   in
K.S.Rashid and son Vs.Income Tax Investigation Commission and
others, AIR 1954 SC 207 held that Article 226 of the Constitution
confers on all the High Courts a very wide power in the mattere of
issuing writs. The said power is limited. However, the remedy of writ is
an absolutely discretionary remedy and the High Court has always the
discretion to refuse to grant any writ if it is satisfied that the aggrieved
party can have an adequate or suitable relief elsewhere. Similar view has
been reiterated by the Apex Court in Sangram Singh Vs.Election
Tribunal, Kotah and another, AIR 1955 SC 425: 1955(2) SCR 1,
holding that the power of issuing writs are purely discretionary and no
limit can be placed upon that discretion.
12.             The aforesaid view has also been taken subsequently in
catena of decisions including the judgments cited by Mr.Mishra. It is
stated that out of Ac.2.00, Ac.0.450 dec. was required for construction of

                                            17
      4/6 lane road to AIIMS        from Sijua to Bhubaneswar, the balance
      Ac.1.550 dec. should be considered for allotment in favour of the
      petitioner-School with the premium, ground rent and cess applicable for
      such allotment. So far as applicability of equity is concerned, it is stated
      that the housing accommodation is made for needy people. Equally
      education is also essential for all categories of people remaining in and
      around the locality. Therefore, the contention raised that teaching in
      English medium school is not required for all, is bereft of any substance.
      13.            In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, and the
      law applicable to the present context, the impugned order dated
      29.5.2007 passed in D.R.Case No. 48 of 2001 and Alienation Case No.25
      of 2001 under Annexure-12 and confirmation thereof vide order dated
      21.5.2008 in W.L.Appeal (OGLS) Case No. 27 of 2008 under Annexure-
      16 are hereby quashed and the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar is directed to
      proceed for allotment of the remaining land       measuring Ac.1.550 dec.
      out of Ac.2.00 in favour of the petitioner-School.
      14.            The writ petition is accordingly allowed. There shall be no
      order as to cost.
                                                       ……….………………………..

S.Panda, J.         I agree
