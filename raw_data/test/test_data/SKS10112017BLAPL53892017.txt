        P R E S E N T:
                     THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO
        ………………………………………………………………………..................
        Date of Hearing: 08.11.2017                     Date of Order: 10.11.2017
        ……………………………………………………………………………………...
S. K. SAHOO, J.      Criminals and politics which should have been poles
        apart from each other are now on the two sides of the same
        coin. Politics have become criminals’ paradise. Criminals have
        built up their nest in politics by virtue of money and muscle
        power. The trend of criminalization of politics is growing at a fast

                                    2
pace with active connivance of white devils. When the political
atmosphere is infected by virulent criminals’ bacteria, no
antibiotics   can    decontaminate     it.  It  requires   complete
sanitization, identification of such unwanted elements, their
dislodgement and complete seal of their entry path. Here is a
case of politician against whom accusation has been leveled for
playing dirty political game for eliminating his political opponent
for the sake of power. There is no dearth of such politicians in
this Country which is the largest democracy in the world and a
home to 1.324 billion people. They can go to any extent and
commit any crime leaving political ideology far behind. Such
politicians should be changed like diapers which would be a
healthy state of affairs for all concerned.
             This is an application under section 439 of Cr.P.C. for
grant of bail to the petitioner Simanchala Samal in connection
with G.R. Case No.102 of 2017 arising out of Kodala P.S. Case
No.50 of 2017 pending in the Court of learned J.M.F.C.,
Khallikote for offences punishable under sections 147, 148, 452,
294, 302, 506, 120-B read with section 149 of the Indian Penal
Code and sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act.
             The prosecution case, as per the first information
report lodged by Sadasiba Swain of village Mardakote before the

                                 3
Inspector in charge, Kodala police station is that on 20.02.2017
at about 9.30 p.m. while his younger brother Pitambar Swain
(hereafter ‘the deceased’) was taking dinner in his house, the
petitioner along with other co-accused persons being armed with
deadly weapons came to the house of the deceased, kicked and
pelted stones at his door and abused him in filthy language.
When the deceased came out of his house and found the accused
persons in a very aggressive mood, he tried to enter into the
house but the petitioner dragged him from the house, abused
him in filthy language and assaulted him by means of sword. The
other accused persons also assaulted the deceased by means of
different weapons as well as by kick and fist blows. When the
son of the deceased, Rama Chandra Barada, Prafulla Sahoo so
also the informant tried to rescue the deceased, they were also
assaulted.
             The petitioner moved an application for bail before
the Court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Chatrapur which was
rejected on 12.07.2017.
             Mr.   Asok   Mohanty,   learned    Senior  Advocate
appearing for the petitioner contended that there are three
independent eye witnesses to the occurrence namely, Trinath
Swain, Jogi Mohapatra and Rabi Pallai and they have not stated

                                   4
about the presence of the petitioner at the scene of occurrence.
Though as per F.I.R., apart from the deceased, four persons
including the informant were assaulted but two of them namely,
Rama Chandra Barad and Prafulla Sahoo sustained injuries and
out of those two injured, Prafulla Sahoo has not stated about the
presence of the petitioner at the spot and the other injured Rama
Chandra Barad though stated about the presence of the
petitioner at the spot in his 161 Cr.P.C. statement but during
supervision by Addl S.P., he has not stated about such presence.
He further contended that only the close relatives of the
deceased like his wife, son, daughter, brother and nephew have
stated about the involvement of the petitioner in the assault of
the deceased and they are highly interested witnesses and
therefore, the possibility of false implication of the petitioner on
account of political rivalry cannot be ruled out. It is further
contended that even though two witnesses namely, Dipti Prakash
Nayak and Dibakar Swain have stated about a meeting which
was organized in the house of the petitioner prior to the
occurrence where other co-accused persons were also present
but there is no material as to what was discussed in that meeting
and what decision was taken therein and therefore, it cannot be
said that the petitioner was a party to the conspiracy. It is

                                  5
further contended that the petitioner is in custody since
29.05.2017 and therefore, his bail application may be favourably
considered.
             Mr. Arupananda Das, learned Addl. Government
Advocate appearing for the State on the other hand contended
that the investigation has been kept open and some accused
persons are yet to be arrested. It is further contended that it is a
political murder and there are prima facie material against the
petitioner and number of eye witnesses have stated about the
specific overt act played by the petitioner and the post mortem
report indicates the ghastly manner in which the offence has
been committed and therefore, since the petitioner is an
influential person being the Ex-Sarpanch, in the event he is
released on bail, there is likelihood of tampering with the
evidence    and   also  investigation   and   therefore, the    bail
application should be rejected.
             Mr. Suryakanta Dash, learned counsel appearing for
the informant also opposed the prayer for bail and contended
that the occurrence has taken place in an extremely brutal,
barbaric and inhuman manner and the petitioner belonged to the
ruling party and the supervising authority was hand in gloves
with the petitioner due to political pressure for which he has

                                   6
prepared a false supervision report which has got no evidentiary
value in the eye of law. It is further contended that the
statements     of  related    witnesses    cannot   be   disbelieved
particularly when their presence at the spot which is in front of
the house of the deceased cannot be doubted and it is not
expected on their part to falsely implicate the petitioner leaving
the real culprits.
             Law is well settled that while granting bail, the Court
has to keep in mind the nature of accusation, the nature of
evidence in support thereof, the severity of the punishment
which conviction will entail, the character, behaviour, means and
standing of the accused, the circumstances which are peculiar to
the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of
the accused at the time of trial, reasonable apprehension of the
witnesses being tampered with so also the larger interests of the
public or State. Laxity in granting bail in serious offences creates
an adverse impact on the society and makes the society a
paradise for the criminals. The Court granting bail should
exercise its discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter
of course.
             The occurrence in question took place on 20.02.2017
in the night and the first information report was presented on the

                                  7
very next day and specific overt act has been attributed to the
petitioner that he dragged the deceased out of the house to the
village danda and he was armed with a sword and assaulted on
the head of the deceased with such sword. It is also mentioned
that the wife of the deceased was contesting the election of the
Sarpanch against the wife of the petitioner and the occurrence
took place on the previous day of the election. The informant in
his 161 Cr.P.C. statement as well as the family members of the
deceased have also attributed specific overt act against the
petitioner relating to the assault on the deceased. The post
mortem examination report indicates that the deceased has
sustained as many as fourteen external injuries on different
parts of the body and some of the injuries were caused by sharp
cutting weapons and all the injuries were opined in combination
to be sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature.
Therefore, prima facie there are materials to show that the
ocular version of the witnesses relating to the overt act gets
corroboration from the medical evidence. Whether the non-
implication of the petitioner by the independent witnesses in the
assault of the deceased would affect the credibility or otherwise
of the related witnesses are to be adjudicated by the learned trial
Court at the appropriate stage. Law is well settled that the

                                  8
relationship of the witnesses to the deceased cannot be a ground
to throw out their evidence, if it is found to be consistent and
trustworthy or in other words, relationship is not a factor to
affect the credibility of witnesses and the courts have to
scrutinize the evidence of the related witnesses meticulously with
a little care and caution.
              The materials available on record indicate that not
only there is prima facie accusation against the petitioner to
have committed the ghastly crime along with the co-accused
persons but there appears to be motive behind such crime.
Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in the
supervision report, it is mentioned that some of the witnesses
have stated in a different manner so far as the involvement of
the petitioner is concerned. Law is well settled as held in case of
Sunita Devi -Vrs.- State of Bihar reported in (2005) 30
Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 215 that the supervision notes
can in no count be called. They are not a part of the papers
which are supplied to the accused. The supervision notes are
recorded by the supervising officer. The supervision notes cannot
be utilized by the prosecution as a piece of material or evidence
against the accused. At the same time, the accused cannot make
any reference to them for any purpose. If any reference is made

                                    9
before any Court to the supervision notes, they are not to be
taken note of by the concerned Court. The supervision notes
should not have unauthorized access to the official reports. Due
care and caution should be taken to see that while supplying
police papers, supervision notes are not given. In the said case,
the Chief Secretary of each State and Union Territory and the
concerned Director General of Police were directed to ensure that
the supervision notes are not made available to any person and
to ensure that confidentiality of the supervision notes is
protected. In spite of such observation by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, the learned counsel for the petitioner during course of
argument produced the xerox copy of the supervision note of
Shri P.K. Mohapatra (OPS-1), Additional S.P., Ganjam. Learned
counsel for the State on perusal of the charge sheet submitted
that supervision note had been prepared in the case and on
instruction, he submitted that the supervision note which was
produced by the learned counsel for the petitioner was genuine.
Thus it appears that in spite of the direction of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Sunita Devi (supra), the
confidentiality of the supervision report has not been maintained
and the petitioner got access to such report. This is a sorry state
of affairs which indicates that all is not well with the investigating

                                        10
agency. They should be more careful while dealing with such
sensitive cases.
                 In view of the availability of prima facie materials
against       the     petitioner  regarding   his  involvement   in   the
commission          of    ghastly crime,  the   nature  and   gravity  of
accusation, the nature of supporting evidence, the severity of
punishment in case of conviction, reasonable apprehension of
tampering with the evidence and taking into account the fact
that further investigation of the case is under progress, it would
not be proper at this stage to release the petitioner on bail.
                 Accordingly, the BLAPL application stands dismissed.
                                                       ……………………………
