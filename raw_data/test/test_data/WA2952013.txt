                           JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV)
(P.K.Saikia,J)
        This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 09.09.2013,
rendered by the learned Single Judge in WP(C) No. 990/2013, refusing to interfere
with the judgment dated 26.12.2012, rendered by the learned Member, Foreigners
Tribunal No. III, Barpeta in FT Case No. 71(III)/2011 (IM(D)T) Ref. Case No.
3569/B/1998 (Government of Assam-vs- Fateman Nessa) declaring the appellant
herein to be foreign national.
2.      We have heard Mr. B. Banerjee, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. D F A
Ahmed, learned counsel for the appellant and also heard Mr. S. C. Keyal, learned
Asstt. S G I as well as Mr. M. Bhagabati, learned G. A., Assam.
3.      The brief facts, projected by the appellant herein in the writ petition are that
SP(B), Barpeta made a reference under the IMDT Act vide IMDT (D) Reference No.
3569/B/1998, expressing doubt about the nationality of the appellant herein (who
would be referred to as the petitioner hereinafter). Subsequently, the case was
transferred to the Foreigners’ Tribunal following abolition of IMDT Act.
4.      On the receipt of the copies from the Tribunal, the petitioner herein entered
appearance in the proceeding before the Tribunal and filed Written Statement (in
                                                                      WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                         3
short W.S.) claiming that she is an Indian citizen by birth. To support her case that
she is an India citizen by birth, she adduced some documents besides examining
herself as DW 1 and one Sadulla Ahmed as DW 2, said to be her brother.
5.       On hearing the learned counsel for both the parties, the learned Tribunal
came to the conclusion that she could not establish that she is an Indian citizen by
birth and hence she was declared foreigner vide judgment dated 26.12.2012 in FT
Case No. 71(III)/2011. Consequently, the order was passed to push her back to her
country of origin .
6.       Being aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred a proceeding under Article 226
of the Constitution of India and challenged the order rendered by the learned
Tribunal in FT Case No. 71(III)/2011 on 26.12.2012. This court issued notice to both
the parties and on conclusion of trial, it had found that there is no scope whatsoever
for the writ court to interfere with the judgment in question and accordingly, the writ
proceeding was dismissed vide judgment dated 09.09.2013, rendered by the learned
Single Judge in WP(C) No. 990/2013.
7.       Still being aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred this appeal alleging that the
judgments in question in this appeal are not rendered in accordance with the
prescription of law nor was it rendered on the basis of facts on records and as such,
same are liable to be quashed and set aside. Such a contention was hotly denied by
learned counsel appearing for the State respondents contending that the judgments
under challenge were rendered in accordance with prescription of law and therefore,
same cannot be quashed and set aside as prayed for.
8.       To support their respective case, the counsel for the parties took us through
the judgments aforesaid and also caused us to peruse the various materials found
available on record. However, before one could proceed further, he needs to keep in
mind that High Court exercising its power of judicial review under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India cannot sit on appeal over the finding of facts recorded by the
Court/Tribunal. It is only when the Court/Tribunal exercises a jurisdiction without
being empowered or in excess of it or fails to exercise the vested jurisdiction or acts
illegally, the Writ Court exercising its jurisdiction can interfere with the same.
                                                                        WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                                4
9.      Further the High Court can interfere with the order of the Tribunal exercising
its writ jurisdiction, if it is proved that it is a case of no evidence at all or there is
error apparent on the face of the record. The power of judicial review under Article
226 of the Constitution is limited only to correction of errors apparent on the face of
the records and does not need long drawn out process of reasoning on points
whether there may be conceivably two views.
10.     The jurisdiction of this Court dealing with a writ appeal is even more
circumscribed. Keeping the above principle in mind we find it necessary to consider
the dispute projected through the present appeal. In this connection, we also find it
necessary to have a look at the judgments under challenge in this appeal. The
relevant part of the same is also reproduced below:--
                 “3.      On receipt of notice from the Tribunal, the petitioner upon
                 appearance filed her written statement on 27.07.2011 inter-alia stating that
                 she is a Bonafide citizen of India by birth and that her father's name Mobed
                 Ali appeared in the Electoral Roll of 1965 of the then No. 48 Bhawanipur,
                 LAC. In the written statement, she also claimed that her father's name also
                 appeared in the N.R.C of 1951 and that her father purchased a plot of land
                 measuring 1 Bigha 17 Lachas covered by Dag No. 150 under periodic patta
                 No. 10 of village-Purbalowashur under P.S, Barpeta, through a registered
                 sale deed No. NIL/1969 dated 19.12.1969.
                 4.       According to the written statement, the petitioner got married with
                 one Shaizuddin son of Rahizuddin of village- Pithadigaon and that her name
                 appeared in the Electoral Roll of 1985 of 46 No., Sarukhetri, L.A.C. In support
                 of her aforesaid claim in the written statement, the petitioner produced the
                 photocopy of voter list of 1965 containing the name of one Mobed Ali and
                 photocopy of purported N.R.C containing 4 names, one of whom she seeks
                 to identify as her father. However, the contents of the said purported N.R.C
                 are not legible and prima facie the name of Mobed Ali is not discernible. The
                 petitioner also produced photocopy of voter list of 1985 containing the name
                 of one Fateman Nessa along with Shaizuddin, whom she claims to be her
                 husband. She also produced photocopy of a sale deed containing the name
                 of Mobed Ali Bepari, son of Late Haji Osimuddin. No date of the sale deed is
                 discernible and prima facie appears to be un-registered. The petitioner also
                 produced the voter lists of 1970 and 1971 containing the name of one Sobed
                 Ali.
                 5.       Learned Tribunal appreciating the evidence on record has held that
                 the petitioner failed to establish that she is an Indian citizen and that too by
                 birth. The petitioner in her evidence on oath as DW1 stated that she was
                 born and brought up at village-Purbalowashur. In reference to the written
                 statement, she also stated about the documents and exhibited the
                 photocopies of the same i.e. voter lists of 1970, 1971 and 1985, the
                                                                             WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                               5
certificate of village Gaonburah and the sale deed as Ext. A, B, C, D and E
respectively.
6.       The petitioner also examined one Md. Sadulla Ahmed as DW2 who
in his deposition stated that the petitioner is his own elder sister and that
their father Late Mobed Ali had landed property at village Nalirpur under PS
and District Barpeta. He also stated that his name appeared in the voter lists
of 1985, 1997 and 2010 (Ext. G, H and I). He further stated that, he was born
in 1970 and that the petitioner was elder to him by about 30-40 years and
also that he was only 2 years of age when his sister i.e. the petitioner was
given on marriage as told to him by his mother Late Amina Khatun. He
further stated in his deposition that his father expired in the year 1980 and
thereafter his mother in 2006.
7.       The learned Tribunal on careful consideration of the written
statement filed by the petitioner and the evidences adduced by her including
the documentary evidences found discrepancies narrated in the impugned
judgment and order leading to failure of the petitioner to establish that she
is an Indian Citizen by birth. In her written statement supported by an
affidavit dated 20.07.2011, the petitioner has stated that the name of her
father Mobed Ali appeared in the Electoral Roll of 1965 and also in the NRC
of 1951. However, she did not file, exhibit or prove any certified copy of the
Electoral Roll of 1965 or the certified true copies of NRC of 1951 showing the
name of Mobed Ali. The photo copy of the NRC even if considered to be true,
it is found to be of no help to the case of the petitioner. Though the
petitioner stated in her written statement that her father Mobed Ali's name
appeared in the NRC of 1951, but as discussed by the learned Tribunal in the
impugned judgment and order, she is completely silent about the same in
her evidence recorded on oath. She has not stated anything in her evidence
regarding the NRC.
8.     As discussed above, in the photo copy of the NRC, the contents are not
legible, but even if it is accepted that Mobed Ali's name is there with Bhanu
Nessa and Khatu Nessa, but the petitioner did not state anything about the
same either in her written statement or in her evidence on oath.
9.       DW 2, in his evidence has stated that he was about 2 years old when
the petitioner i.e his sister was given on marriage. It has rightly been held by
the learned Tribunal that even if the name of Mobed Ali appeared in the NRC
of 1951 but in absence of any cogent proof that the said person is the father
of the petitioner, mere production of the same is of no help to the case of
the petitioner. It has rightly been recorded by the learned Tribunal that non-
mentioning of the name of the petitioner's father is very vital. No document
was produced and proved to show that the name of the mother of the
petitioner is Amina Khatun. If Amina Khatun is, in fact her mother, she
having died only in 2006, there cannot be any earthly reason as to why no
certified copy of any voter list showing her name could be produced by the
petitioner. If Mobed Ali is accepted to be the father of the petitioner then
also it is not understood as to why the names of his two wives did not
appear in any of the voter lists.
                                                           WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                   6
10.      Learned Tribunal after the elaborate discussion of the entire
evidence and recording the huge discrepancies easily discernible from the
said evidence having held that the petitioner could not discharge the burden
of proof to establish that she is an Indian Citizen and that too by birth, this
Court exercising its power of Judicial Review under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India cannot sit on appeal over the said findings by
scrutinizing the evidence so as to return another finding.
11.      In Sarbananda Sonowal-I Vs. union of India reported in (2005) 5 SCC
665, the Apex Court while discussing the problem being faced by the State of
Assam due to illegal migration and their continued presence in the State has
been vividly discussed the alarming situation. While striking out the IM(D)T
Act, 1983, the Apex Court also dealt with the modality of proving one's
Indian citizenship. It has been emphasized that the burden of proof is always
on the proceedee as per provisions of Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.
In Sarbananda Sonowal-I, the Apex Court dealing with the burden of proof,
made the following observation :-
“26. There is good and sound reason for placing the burden of proof upon
the person concerned who asserts to be a citizen of a particular country. In
order to establish one's citizenship, normally he may be required to give
evidence of (i) his date of birth (ii) place of birth (iii) name of his parents (iv)
their place of birth and citizenship. Sometimes the place of birth of his
grandparents may also be relevant like under Section 6-A(1)(d) of the
Citizenship Act. All these facts would be necessarily be within the personal
knowledge of the person concerned and hot of the authorities of the State.
After he has given evidence on these points, the State authorities can verify
the facts and can then lead evidence in rebuttal, if necessary. If the State
authorities dispute the claim of citizenship by a person and assert that he is
a foreigner, it will not only be difficult but almost impossible for them to first
lead evidence on the aforesaid points. This is in accordance with the
underlying policy of Section 106 of the Evidence Act which says that when
any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of
proving that fact is upon him.”
12.      Above apart, merely by producing some photocopies, one cannot
establish his Indian citizenship. Even in case of production of certified copies
of the documents, something more is required as per the Law of Evidence. As
has been held by the Apex Court in (2010) 4 SCC 491 (LIC of India Vs. Ram Pal
Singh Bisen), even admission of a document in evidence does not amount to
its proof, in other words, mere making of exhibit of a document does not
dispense with its proof, which is required to be done in accordance with law.
It was the duty of the petitioners to have proved the documents in
accordance with law. Under the Law of Evidence also, it is necessary that
contents of documents are required to be proved either by primary or by
secondary evidence. At the most, admission of documents may amounts to
admission of contents but not its truth. Thus, the documents (Photocopies)
having not been produced and marked as required under the Evidence Act,
cannot be relied upon by the Court. Contents of the document cannot be
proved by merely filing in a Court.”
                                                               WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                     7
11.     A perusal of the judgment reveals that the appellant herein claims that she is
an Indian citizen by birth and in that connection, she tried to establish her linkage
with one Mabed Ali claiming that the appellant is the daughter of said Mabed Ali,
who found his name included in NRC of 1951 as well as in the voter list of 1965. She
also claimed that one Sadulla Ahmed (DW 2) is an employee of Accountant General,
Assam, Guwahati and is the son of said Mabed Ali and said Sadulla Ahmed (DW 2)
happens to be her own brother. In support of such contention, she also produced
before the Tribunal a number of documents to show that Mabed Ali was a genuine
Indian citizen who acquired landed property in the district of Barpeta in the State of
Assam even before 1971.
12.     We have already found that learned Tribunal as well as the learned Single
Judge considered those documents and held that documents which were produced
to show that the appellant is a genuine Indian citizen were not proved in accordance
with prescription of law. The learned Single Judge as well as learned Tribunal also
held that even if one assumes for the sake of arguments that those documents were
proved in accordance with prescription of law, yet, one would find that the facts,
recorded in those documents, are enormously inconsistent which make all those
documents totally unsafe for reliance which, in turn, shows that the appellant could
not establish that Mobed Ali is an Indian citizen.
13.     Learned tribunal and learned Single Judge also came to the conclusion that
even if one assumes that said Mobed Ali is a genuine Indian citizen, yet then, the
appellant miserably fails to show that she is the daughter of said Mobed Ali. It is in
those backdrops, let us examine such findings of the learned Single Judge as well as
learned Tribunal having regard to the materials on record as well as judgments
under challenge.
14.   A bare perusal of the judgments in question in the light of materials on record
leaves no manner of doubt that the appellant never proves the documents which she
produced before the tribunal to substantiate her claim that she is a citizen of India
by birth. Being so, one cannot find fault with the decisions of the learned Single
Judge as well as learned Tribunal that the appellant could not prove any document
to show that Mobed Ali, who is said to be her father, was a genuine Indian citizen.
                                                                   WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                        8
What is important to note is that those documents give contradictory pictures
regarding her claim that she is an Indian citizen by birth.
15.   At one point of time, learned Single Judge as well as learned Tribunal assumes
for the sake of argument that said Mobed Ali is an Indian citizen and then tried to
ascertain if the claim of the appellant that she is daughter of said Mobed Ali is made
out. Both learned Single Judge as well as learned Tribunal on their independent
scrutiny of the matter, came to the conclusion that the appellant could not establish
that she is the daughter of aforesaid Mobed Ali. Let us see if such finding is correct.
 16.    It is found from the testimony of DW 2 that appellant is her own sister. It is
found evident from the evidence of DW 2 that name of mother of DW 2 is one
Amina Khatun who reportedly        died in 2006. But then, NRC of 1951 or for that
matter voter list of 1965 reveals that said Mabed Ali had 2 wives, they being Bhanu
Nessa and Khatu Nessa.
17.     It does not speak anything about Amina Khatun being also the wife of
aforesaid Mabed Ali. The appellant owes an explanation how and when Amina
Khatun become the wife of said Mobed Ali. Unfortunately, such explanation was
found conspicuously missing in all the evidence tendered from the side of the
appellant. Such a failure makes the claim of the appellant that she is the daughter of
said Mobed Ali is enormously doubtful.
 18.    It is found from the testimony of DW 2 that he was born in 1970 meaning
thereby that Mabed Ali must have married the mother of DW 1 even before 1970.
This shows that name of Amina Khatun, as being the wife of said Mabed Ali, must
have been incorporated in the voter lists prepared in post 1971 period. However, not
a single voter list of post 1971 period was produced before the tribunal to show that
Amina Khatun, mother of DW2, was the wife of said Mabed Ali although Mobed Ali
remained alive upto 1980 and said Amina Khatun too lived upto 2006. Such failure,
in turn, makes the claim of the appellant that she is the daughter of said Mobed Ali
through one Amina Khatun even more suspicious.
19.     It is equally worth noting that in his evidence that DW 2 deposes that he
was told by his mother (Amina Khatun) that when the petitioner (appellant) was
married of to one Shaizuddin, DW 2 was a baby of 2 years of age only. It is also in
                                                                     WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                      9
the evidence that petitioner is 38/40 years older to DW 2. However, such a claim
stands completely demolished in view of fact that when both of them were examined
as DW 1 and DW 2 in 2012, DW1 and DW2 claim that their age in 2012 was 55 and
43 respectively meaning thereby the age difference between DW1 and DW2 is only
12 years, and not 38-40 years as claimed by DW 2. This further casts a doubt on the
claim of the appellant that she was the daughter of aforesaid Mobed Ali.
20.     It is equally important to note that the DW 2, as stated above, claims that he
was born in 1970 and his sister DW 1 (appellant herein) was about 38 to 40 years
older to him. If that be the position, the appellant must have been born during the
period between 1928 and 1930 and in that event, she must be a woman of about 21
years of age when NRC was prepared in 1951.
21.     This strongly suggests that the name of the appellant must have found its
place in the NRC of 1951 if she was born in between 1938 and 1940. But there is
nothing on record to show that the name of mother of the appellant was found
incorporated in NRC 1951 or any other voter lists, prepared prior to 1971.
22.     Worst still, though mother of appellant reportedly died in 2006, not a single
voter list, prepared in post 1971 period were produced before the tribunal to show
that she was the wife of Mobed Ali to support the claim of the appellant that the
appellant is the daughter of Mobed Ali who is said to be a genuine Indian citizen.
Such a failure on the part of the appellant to produce before the tribunal the
aforesaid voter lists is one more testimony of claim of the petitioner being the
daughter of said Mobed Ali is without any substance.
23.     It is found that the learned Tribunal has observed that in voters list of 1965,
the age of Mabed Ali was shown as 50 years, however, in the voters list of 1970, his
age was shown as 46. How a person, who was to be 55 years in 1970, became 10
years younger in 1970 remains far from being explained. This not only casts a
serious doubt about the very identity of aforesaid Mabed Ali who is said to be the
father of the petitioner but also makes the claim of the appellant that she is the
daughter of Mobed more and more doubtful.
24.     The judgments in question reveals that the learned Tribunal also finds, and
quite rightly so, that Mabed Ali had died as per evidence of DW 2 in the year 1980.
                                                                   WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                     10
But then, the certificate, issued by the Gaon Bura in 1993, shows that Mabed Ali was
a resident of a place called Pub Luwashur in the district of Barpeta in 1993. How
could a Gaonbura certify a man who died as back as 1980 to be a resident of Pub-
Luwashur in 1993 has not been explained? This coupled with the fact that the Gaon
Bura has no authority to issue such a certificate makes all those claims shrouded
with serious doubt.
25.     The NRC of 1951 reveals that Osman Uddin, (said to be grandfather of the
appellant) had one son by name Nasik Ali, but then, his name was not shown along
with Mobed Ali in the voter list of 1965. In the facts and circumstances of the case in
hand, the appellant owes an explanation as to why the name of said Nasik Ali,
brother of Mobed Ali did not figure along with Mobed Ali in the voter list of 1965. But
same was not done. This is another reason which casts a doubt on the claim of the
appellant made in the proceeding before the Tribunal.
26.     Learned Tribunal also found fault with the claim of DW 1 that the appellant is
his own sister. In that regard, the Tribunal noticed that the name of DW 2 (son of
Mobet Ali?) appeared in the voter list of 1985 and his age was shown as 21 years in
1985. However, it is his own claim that he was born in 1970 meaning thereby that in
1985, he was a boy of 15 years of age only and despite that being the position, he
became a voter in 1985 which is, however, not permissible under the law since
during the time in question the minimum age to acquire the right to vote was 21
years.
27.     A careful perusal of the materials on record reveals that as per NRC of 1951,
Osman Uddin, father of Mobed Ali, was not alive in 1951. It is also found apparent
that all the voter lists, produced before the Tribunal shows that Osman Uddin died
long before 1965. But then, a patta issued in 1965, which is produced before the
Tribunal, shows that such a patta was issued in the name of Osman Uddin although
he is stated to have expired even before 1951. This also casts a serious doubt not
only about the authenticity of the claim of the appellant that Osman Uddin was the
father of aforesaid Mobed Ali but it also throws the claim of appellant that she is a
bonafide citizen of India to a labyrinth of suspicion.
28.     Our forgoing discussion reveals that the appellant could not prove that
Mobed Ali is a genuine Indian citizen. Nor could she prove that she is the daughter
                                                                    WA No. 295 of 2013

                                                                                     11
of aforesaid Mobed Ali, even one assumes for the sake of argument that Mobed Ali is
an Indian citizen. Being so, we are of the opinion that the claim of the appellant that
she is an Indian citizen by birth is found to be fallen through.
29.     In view of our forgoing discussion, it needs to be concluded that the
judgments under challenge do not suffer from any infirmity whatsoever and as such,
present appeal deserves to be dismissed.
30.     This appeal is accordingly dismissed.
31.     A copy of this judgment be furnished to the SP (B) Barpeta for doing needful
as indicated in paragraph 15 of the judgment of learned Single Judge.
