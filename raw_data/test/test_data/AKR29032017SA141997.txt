Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         This appeal is directed against the judgment and
      decree dated 25.9.96 and 10.10.1996 respectively passed by the
      learned 1st Addl. District Judge, Berhampur in T.A. No.9/94 (T.A.
      No.60/93 GDC) confirming the judgment and decree dated 6.9.93
      and 18.9.93 respectively passed by the learned Subordinate Judge,
      Aska in T.S. No.13 of 1989
      02.           The case of the plaintiff is that originally the suit land
      belonged to ex-estate of Sanakhemundi. One Laxman Gouda was a
      raiyat under the Zamindar of Sanakhemundi. The Zamindar granted

                                     2
raiyati patta to him. To press his legal necessity, Laxman Gouda
sold 40 bharanas, i.e., about Ac.8.00 of land to Somnath Padhi for a
valid consideration by means of a registered sale deed. Somnath
Padhi was in possession of the land and used to pay rajbhag to the
estate. He became the defaulter of payment of rent for which, the
Court of Wards, which was managing the affairs of the estate on
behalf of minor Zamindar, filed suits in Rent Court under the Madras
Estate Land Act for realization of rent. The same was decreed.
Thereafter Somnath Padhi paid rent and obtained receipts. He
reclaimed adjoining 0.26 cents of land and as such he was in
possession of Ac.8.26 cents of land. Somnath Padhi, for his legal
necessity, alienated the land to one Tareni Charan Mishra for a
consideration of Rs.1000/- and thereafter delivered possession.
Tareni Charan Mishra inducted the plaintiff as a tenant and executed
permanent lease on 15.4.1958 in his favour. The plaintiff continued
as a permanent lessee and cultivated the land through his father till
1964. Thereafter Tareni Charan Mishra alienated the land to the
plaintiff for a valid consideration by means of a registered sale deed
dated 31.12.1964 and thereafter delivered possession. While the
matter stood thus, the estate of Sanakhemundi vested in the State
of Orissa on 1.6.1953. Though the land was recorded as Abadi Jogya
Anabadi, but the plaintiff cultivated the same as a raiyat. Three
encroachment cases had been initiated against the plaintiff. He
appeared before the Tahasildar, Digapahandi and claimed that he is
a raiyat. He had also filed number of documents evidencing the
payment of rent. Thereafter the Tahasildar sent the entire file to the
S.D.O., Berhampur to examine as to whether the encroacher has
acquired title by way of adverse possession. No order was passed.
After issuance of notice under Sec.80 C.P.C., he instituted the suit
seeking declaration that he is a raiyat in respect of the suit land.

                                       3
03.          Pursuant to issuance of summons, the defendants
entered appearance and filed a comprehensive written statement
denying the assertions made in the plaint. The defendants denied
that the plaintiff was a raiyat. The specific case of the defendants is
that the suit plots were recorded as Jhatibana in Abada Jogya
Anabadi    khata.   The    same    is   the exclusive   property  of   the
Government. The record of right was published on 28.11.1948 in the
name of the Government. The plaintiff has not challenged the same.
Since    the  plaintiff   was   in    unauthorised   occupation   of   the
Government      land,   several   encroachment     cases   were  initiated
against him. The Tahasildar sent the records to the S.D.O.,
Berhampur. Thereafter the S.D.O., Berhampur considered the cases
and returned the file vide office letter dated 11.10.1988 for fresh
enquiry which is pending disposal.
04.          Stemming on the pleadings of the parties, learned trial
court struck six issues. To substantiate the case, the plaintiff had
examined three witnesses and on his behalf eleven documents had
been exhibited. The defendants had examined two witnesses and on
their behalf four documents had been exhibited.
05.          Learned trial court came to hold that Ext.10 series, rent
receipts, are no way connected to the suit land as no khatian
number or extent of land had been mentioned in the rent receipts.
The plaintiff had not taken any steps to get the land mutated in his
name. He could not have paid rent as no record of right was
prepared in his name. The documents had been created for the
purpose of the suit. D.W.1 had stated that in the final record of
right, the suit land had been recorded as Abada Jogya Anabadi. The
same was classified as ‘Jhatibana’ in the record of right of the year
1948. Three encroachment cases had been initiated against the

                                        4
plaintiff in the year 1971. The same are sub-judice. Without
verifying the record of right, the plaintiff purchased the Govt. land in
the year 1964. The persons without having title over the suit land
one after the other had transferred the same. Since the O.P.L.E.
proceedings are pending, the court has no jurisdiction to declare the
title of the plaintiff. Held so, learned trial court dismissed the suit.
The plaintiff had unsuccessfully challenged the judgment and decree
of the learned trial court before the learned District Judge,
Berhampur in T.A. No.60 of 1993, which was transferred to the
court of the learned 1st Additional District Judge, Berhampur and
renumbered as T.A. No.9 of 1994. Learned lower appellate court on
a threadbare analysis of the evidence on record as well as pleadings
came to hold that the plaintiff had purchased the land from a
trespasser. His continuous cultivation for 25 years was in the
capacity of an independent trespasser. The independent trespassers
cannot tack their possession so as to acquire title by adverse
possession. The suit lands were recorded in the name of the State.
The jurisdiction of the civil court is barred under Sec.16 of the
O.P.L.E. Act. The estate was vested in the State on 1.6.53 free from
encumbrance. The respondents are the owners of the same.
Accordingly, ROR was prepared in the year 1984. The persons
having no title transferred the lands after 1968. Learned lower
appellate court dismissed the appeal.
06.          The second appeal was admitted by a Bench of this
Court on the following substantial question of law.
                      “Whether the civil court has jurisdiction to arrive at
                      a conclusion regarding royati right vis-à-vis the
                      provisions of Orissa Estate Abolition Act.”

                                     5
07.          Heard Mr. P.V.B. Rao, learned counsel for the appellant
and Mr. S. Mishra, learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the
respondents.
08.          Mr. Rao, learned counsel for the appellant submitted
that originally the suit land belongs to ex-estate of Sanakhemundi.
The ex-intermediary granted raiyati patta to one Laxman Gouda.
Laxman Gouda was a raiyat. For his legal necessity, he alienated the
land to Somnath Padhi. Thereafter Somnath Padhi alienated the land
to one Tareni Charan Mishra. Thereafter Tareni Charan Mishra
alienated the land to the plaintiff for a valid consideration by means
of a registered sale deed. Possession of the land was duly delivered
to the plaintiff. Though the estate vested in the State, but the right
of the plaintiff remained unaffected. Since it is a raiyati land,
initiation of encroachment cases are bad in law. He further
submitted that since the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land for
more than thirty years, he has perfected title by way of adverse
possession. Thus under the provisions of Orissa Prevention of Land
Encroachment Act (hereinafter referred to as “OPLE Act”), the land
could have been settled in his favour. The entries made in the ROR
do not create title nor extinguish title. He further submitted that
notwithstanding the bar contained in Sec.16 of the OPLE Act, the
civil court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
09.          Per contra, Mr. Mishra, learned Additional Standing
Counsel for the respondents submitted that originally the land
belong to ex-intermediary. The estate vested in the State of Orissa
on 1.6.1953 free from all encumbrances. Record of right was
published on 28.11.1948 in the name of the Government. The
kissam    of  the   land   was   Jhatibana.   Since  the  plaintiff was
unauthorised occupation of the suit land, encroachment cases had

                                     6
been initiated against him. The same are pending. Both the courts
below negatived the contentions of the plaintiff and dismissed the
suit.
10.          Placing reliance on a decision of this Court in the case of
Narayan Chandra Yotish vs. The State of Orissa and another, 73
(1992) C.L.T. 860, learned trial court came to hold that the suit is
not maintainable.
11.          The civil court has plenary jurisdiction. Seventy-five
years ago, the Privy Council in the case of Secretary of State vs.
Mask & Co., AIR 1940 PC 105 held that the exclusion of the
jurisdiction of the civil courts is not to be readily inferred, but that
such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied.
It is also well settled that even if the jurisdiction is so excluded, the
civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the
provisions of the Act have not been complied with, or the statutory
tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles
of judicial procedure.
12.          In State of Orissa vs. Bhanumali (Dead) Nurpa Bewa
and others, AIR 1996 ORISSA 199, a Bench of this Court came to
hold that the decision of the apex Court in the case of Govt. of
Andhra Pradesh vs. Thummala Krishna Rao and another, AIR 1982
SC 1081 was not followed in Narayan Chandra Yotish (supra).
Taking cue from Narayan Chandra Yotish (supra) and the decisions
of this Court in the case of Ghasi Khamari and others vs. State of
Orissa and others, ILR 1980 (1) Cutt.582, Satyabadi Naik vs. The
State of Orissa, AIR 1979 Orissa 8, this Court held that the Civil
Court had jurisdiction to decide the question raised before it. It was
further held that the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case
of Narayan Chandra Yotish (supra) did not take note of the two

                                        7
Bench decisions of this Court arising under the very same Act as
well as the decision of the apex Court rendered under an Act
containing pari materia provisions must be taken to have been
wrongly decided.
13.          In view of the above, notwithstanding the bar contained
in Sec.16 of the OPLE Act, the civil court has jurisdiction to
adjudicate the complicated question of title.
14.          Sec.39     of   the    Orissa    Estates     Abolition   Act,  1951
(hereinafter referred to as “O.E.A. Act”) provides:
                  “39. Bar to jurisdiction of Civil Courts in certain
                  matters- No suit shall be brought in any Civil Court
                  in respect of any entry in or omission from a
                  Compensation Assessment roll or in respect of any
                  order passed under Chapters II to VI or concerning
                  any matter which is or has already been the
                  subject to any application made or proceeding
                  taken under the side Chapters.”
15.          This Court in the case of Benudhar Dalai vs. The State of
Orissa, AIR 1958 ORISSA 197 held:
                  “Section 39 of the Orissa Estates Abolition Act bars
                  the jurisdiction of the civil court in respect of any
                  order passed under Chapters II to VI, or
                  concerning any matter which is or has already
                  been the subject of any application made, or
                  proceedings taken under the said Chapters. This
                  bar will undoubtedly apply as regards the
                  Collector’s finding that the lease or settlement was
                  made with the object of (1) defeating any of the
                  provisions of the Act or (2) obtaining higher
                  compensation thereunder. But the bar will not
                  apply to his finding as regards the date of lease or
                  settlement. The civil court has always jurisdiction
                  to examine whether a special court constituted by
                  a special Act, has acted within its jurisdiction
                  unless that power is expressly taken away.”
16.          A  Division      Bench     of   this   Court     in  the   case  of
Achutananda Swain vs. Hadibandhu Swain and others, 1986 (II)
OLR-427 held that according to the Sec.39 of the O.E.A. Act, the
following classes of suits cannot be instituted in the civil court:

                                    8
             (1) A suit in respect of any entry in or omission
             from a compensation assessment roll.
             (2) A suit in respect of any order passed under
             Chapters II to VI.
             (3) A suit concerning any matter which is or has
             already been the subject of any application
             made or proceeding taken under Chapters II to
             VI.
             It further held that Sec.39 of the O.E.A. Act does not
create a bar for establishment of the rival claims of tenancy rights in
the civil court.
17.          This Court in the case of Chandra Sekhar Rath vs. The
Collector, Dhenkanal and others, 67 (1989) C.L.T.-493, held that
under Sec.8(1) of the O.E.A. Act, a person who immediately before
the date of vesting of an estate in the State Government was in
possession of a holding as a tenant under an intermediary shall on
and from the date of vesting be deemed to be a tenant of the State
Government and such person shall hold the land under the same
rights and subject to the same restrictions and liabilities as he was
entitled and subject to immediately before the date of vesting. It
further held that since the plaintiff was a tenant under the Deity
prior to the vesting, on the date of vesting he would be deemed to
be a tenant under the State. Such a declaration cannot be given by
the Collector under the Estates Abolition Act and it is only the Civil
Court which is the proper authority to decide such claim. For
declaration of such right section 39 of the Orissa Estate Abolition Act
cannot be held to be a bar.
18.          Reverting to the facts of this case, the settlement record
of right was published in the year 1948 in the name of the
Government of Orissa. The estate of Sanakhemundi vested in the
State of Orissa on 1.6.1953 free from encumbrance. The suit land

                                          9
was classified as ‘Jhatibana’. Both the courts have rightly held that
the plaintiff had purchased the land from a trespasser. The persons
without valid title over the suit land had transferred the same.
Further, the court below came to hold that Ext.10 series, rent
receipts, are no way connected with the suit land, since no khatian
number or extent of land had been mentioned therein. The same
had been created for the purpose of the suit. There is no perversity
or illegality in the finding of the courts below. The substantial
question of law has been answered accordingly.
19.                    In the result the appeal, devoid of any merit, is
dismissed. But in the circumstances of the case, the parties are to
bear their own cost throughout.
