                                      BEFORE
                      THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE B.K. SHARMA
Date of hearing & Judgement:                         21/08/2015
                        JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
1.      Heard Mr. I. Alam, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Ms. V.L.
Singha, learned State Counsel and so also Ms. G. Sarma, learned counsel holding
for Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned ASGI. I have also perused the entire materials on
record along with the records received from the learned Tribunal.
2.      This writ petition is directed against the order dated 29/06/2012 passed
by   the learned Member,         Foreigners Tribunal No.1 in FT         Case  No.
1237/ G/ 2010 (Ref. cas No. R / IM DT/ 1908/ 98) (State of Assam Vs.
M usstt. Sarifan Bew a ). Byu the said order, the petitioner has been declared to
be a foreigner of post 25/03/1971 stream. Learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that minor variations here and there in the name of the person
concerned cannot lead to the inference that the petitioner failed to discharge her
burden of proof as envisaged under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946.
On the other hand, the learned counsel representing the respondents submit that
the learned Tribunal having arrived at a particular finding based on the evidence
on record, the said finding cannot be set aside like an appellate authority while
exercising writ jurisdiction.
3.      The entire find of the learned Tribunal is discernible in para 5 of the
impugned order. They are divided into parts and are reproduced below :-

       “5.
       (i)         The first docum ent relied upon by the OP is the K acha
                   Patta No. 121 (Ex .1). On perusal of the sam e, it is
                   found that the nam es of the proposed pattadars
                   m entioned in it are (a) Nasim uddin Sk (b) K asim uddin
                   Sk and (c) Jahiruddin Sk – all sons of Late Hussain Sk.
                   The OP has stated that the nam e of her grandfather is
                   Ashun Ali Sk. If the nam e of her grandfather w as
                   Ashun Ali Sk then K asim uddin, w hose nam e is show n in
                   Ex. 1 cannot be the father of the OP as the nam e of
                   K asim uddin’s father is show n as Hussain Ali Sk in Ex .1 ;
       (ii)        The second docum ent relied upon by the OP is the
                   voters’ list of 1966 (Ex . 2) w herein the only single
                   nam e m entioned is of one Kasiruddin Sk s/ o. Ashun Sk.
                   The OP has stated that the nam e of her father is
                   K osim uddin Sk and if that be so, m it cannot be said for
                   certain that the nam e m entioned in Ex . 2 is the nam e
                   of the father of the OP. Even if it is conceded for
                   argum ent sake that the nam e K asim uddin Sl as it
                   appears in Ex.1 and the nam e K asiruddin Sk as it
                   appears in Ex . 2, is the nam e of one and dthe sam e
                   person, it cannot be said that the said K asim uddin or
                   K asiruddin is the father of the OP because the father’s
                   nam e of K asim uddin is show n as Hussain Sk in Ex. 1
                   w hereas the father’s nam e of K asiruddin Sk is show n
                   as Ashun Sk in Ex .2 ;
       (iii)       The linkage certificate (Ex.4) also show s that Sarifan
                   Bew a (the OP) is the daughter of K asim uddin Sk but as
                   already stated above the nam e m entioned in the
                   voters’ list of 1966 is of K asiruddin Sk and not
                   K osim uddin or K asim uddin Sk ;
WP(C) 2915 /15 oral dated 21/08/15                         Page 3 of 8

       (iv)        The OP has stated in her cross ex am ination that her
                   m other Aim ona Bew a is still alive but she could not
                   produce any docum ent to show that her m other’s
                   nam e w as ever found recorded in any of the voters’
                   lists in or after the year 1966 ;
       (v)         As per OP’s evidence, her husband Azibor Sk used to
                   live w ith her at her father’s residence and he died after
                   about one year of their m arriage. This show s that the
                   OP still lives in the house of her father w ith her m other
                   w ho is still alive but she has failed to ex plain as to w hy
                   the nam e of her m other w as never recorded in any of
                   the voters’ lists at her village ;
       (vi)        Further, the OP has stated that her present age is
                   about 40 years. If that be so, she should have been
                   born in around 1972. She has subm itted voters’ list of
                   2008 show ing her nam e in the sam e but she could not
                   give satisfactory ex planation as to w hy her nam e did
                   not appear in any of the voters’ lists from 1994 and
                   prior to the voters list of 2008 ;
       (vii)       She has stated in her evidence that her father died
                   about 30 years ago but she did not subm it the certified
                   copy of any voters’ list after 1966 show ing the nam e of
                   her father as a voter. The nam e appearing in the
                   voters’ list of 1966 (Ex .2) also appears to be quite
                   doubtful as the nam e of the purported grandfather of
                   the OP is show n in the voters’ list of 1966 (Ex.2) and in
                   the K acha Patta (Ex .1) is not the sam e ;
       (viii)      Ex. 5 is the land revenue paying receipt w hich sbhow s
                   that the land revenue w as paid for the year 2002-
                   03/ 2011-12 by one Akalu Ali on 13.05.2012 (about a
                   fortnight ago) for and on behalf of Nasim uddin sk and
WP(C) 2915 /15 oral dated 21/08/15                           Page 4 of 8

                   others and as per Ex. 1 (K acha Patta) Nasim uddin Sk
                   and his brothers are sons of one Hussain Sk and not
                   Ashanu Ali Sk. Therefore, from the docum ents relied
                   upon by the OP, it appears to m e that there is no
                   cogent or trustw orthy evidence on record to show that
                   K asiruddin Sk w hose nam e appears in the voters’ list of
                   1966 (Ex .2) is the father of the OP and also that the
                   OP’s father and his brothers have landed property in
                   village Dalsingeralga as claim ed by the OP because the
                   persons w hose nam es appear in Ex . 1 are sons of
                   Hussain Sk and not to Ashun Ali Sk.”
4.      From the above findings recorded by the learned Tribunal, it is found that
there is wide variation in the names to which the learned counsel for the
petitioner had referred to. Although the petitioner in her cross examination
named her mother as Aimona Bewa and claimed that she was still alive, but
she could not produce a single document reflecting her name. Coupled with this,
the petitioner also could not produce any document except the voters’ list of
2008 containing her name. If she was 40 years of age at the time of deposition,
her year of birth would 1972 but she failed to produce any document from 1990
to 2008. She attained the age of voting right in 1990. Although she stated that
her father died about 30 years back but could not produce the certified copy of
the voter list after 1966 showing her father’s name. That apart, the name
appearing in the voters’ list of 1966 (Ex. 2) is also quite doubtful as the name of
the purported grandfather of the petitioner is shown in the voter list and in the
Kachha Patta(Ex.1) is not the same.
5.      Above apart, there are so many discrepancies in the evidence about
which the learned Tribunal has elaborately discussed. Such a finding of fact
cannot be interfered with lightly exercising writ jurisdiction. The Full Bench of this
WP(C) 2915 /15 oral dated 21/08/15                               Page 5 of 8

Court in State of Assam Vs. M oslem M ondal and others reported in 2013
(1) GLT 809 while discussing the scope, ambit and jurisdiction of the Writ Court
in such matter has observed thus :-
        “112. Article 226 of the Constitution confers on the High Court
        pow er to issue appropriate w rit to any person or authority w ithin
        its territorial jurisdiction. The Tribunal constituted under the
        1946 Act read w ith the 1964 Order, as noticed above, is required
        to discharge the quasi-judicial function. The High Court,
        therefore, has the pow er under Article 226 of the Constitution to
        issue w rit of certiorari quashing the decision of the Tribunal in
        an appropriate case. The scope of interference w ith the
        Tribunal's order, in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226,
        how ever, is lim ited. The w rit of certiorari can be issued for
        correcting errors of jurisdiction, as and w hen the inferior Court
        or Tribunal acts w ithout jurisdiction or in excess of it, or fails to
        exercise it or if such Court or Tribunal acts illegally in exercise of
        its undoubted jurisdiction, or w hen it decides w ithout giving an
        opportunity to the parties to be heard or violates the principles
        of natural justice. The certiorari jurisdiction of the w rit Court
        being supervisory and not appellate jurisdiction, the Court
        cannot review the findings of facts reached by the inferior Court
        or Tribunal. There is, how ever, an exception to the said general
        proposition, in as m uch as, the w rit of certiorari can be issued
        and the decision of a Tribunal on a finding of fact can be
        interfered w ith, if in recording such a finding the Tribunal has
        acted on evidence w hich is legally inadm issible or has refused to
        adm it adm issible evidence or if the finding is not supported by
        any evidence at all, because in such cases such error w ould
        am ount to an error of law apparent on the face of the record.
        The other errors of fact, how ever grave it m ay be, cannot be
WP(C) 2915 /15 oral dated 21/08/15                         Page 6 of 8

       corrected by a w rit court. As noticed above, the judicial review of
       the order passed by the inferior Court or the Tribunal, in exercise
       of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, is
       lim ited to correction of errors apparent on the face of the record,
       w hich also takes w ithin its fold a case w here a statutory
       authority exercising its discretionary jurisdiction did not take
       into consideration a relevant fact or renders its decision on
       w holly irrelevant factors. Hence, the failure of taking into
       account the relevant facts or consideration of irrelevant factors,
       w hich has a bearing on the decision of the inferior court or the
       Tribunal, can be a ground for interference of the Court or
       Tribunal's decision in exercise of the w rit jurisdiction by the High
       Court.
       113. The Apex Court in Sant Lal Gupta Vs. M odern Coop. Group
       Housing Society Ltd. reported in (2010)13 SCC 336, reiterating
       the grounds on w hich a w rit of certiorari can be issued, has
       opined that such a w rit can be issued only w hen there is a failure
       of justice and cannot be issued m erely because it m ay be legally
       perm issible to do so. It is obligatory on the part of the
       petitioners to show         that a jurisdictional error has been
       com m itted by the statutory authority. There m ust be an error
       apparent on the face of the record, as the High Court acts m erely
       in a supervisory capacity and not as the appellate authority. An
       error apparent on the face of the records m eans an error w hich
       strikes one on m ere looking and does not need long draw n out
       process of reasoning on points w here there m ay conceivably be
       tw o opinions. Such error should not require any ex traneous
       m atters to show its incorrectness. Such error m ay include giving
       reasons that are bad in law or inconsistent, unintelligible or
       inadequate. It m ay also include the application of a w rong legal
       test to the facts found, taking irrelevant consideration into
WP(C) 2915 /15 oral dated 21/08/15                        Page 7 of 8

        account and failing to take relevant consideration into account,
        and w rongful adm ission or exclusion of evidence as w ell as
        arriving at a conclusion w ithout any supporting evidence. Such a
        w rit can also be issued w hen there is an error in jurisdiction or
        authority w hose order is to be review ed has acted w ithout
        jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction or has failed to
        exercise the jurisdiction vested in him by law .”
6.      In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the writ petition and
accordingly it is dismissed. Now, the Superintendent of Police (B), Dhubri shall
ensure that the petitioner is arrested and detained in the detention camp till her
deportation to her country of origin i.e. Bangladesh.
7.      Let the matter be listed again after one month so as to submit report by
the Superintendent of Police (B) Dhubri about the action taken in the terms of
this order.
8.      The Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri shall ensure deletion of the name of
the petitioner from the voter list, if any.
9.      Registry shall send down the case records to the learned court below
along with a copy of this judgement and order. A copy of the judgement and
order may also be furnished to Ms. V.L. Singha, learned State Counsel for his
immediate necessary follow up action. Copies shall also be sent to the SP(B),
Dhubri and Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri, for their immediate follow up action.
                                                                         JUDGE
