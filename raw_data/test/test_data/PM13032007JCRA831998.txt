             THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE PRADIP MOHANTY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Date of hearing and judgment : 13.03.2007
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   This     appeal has been filed by accused Kandra @
Budhram Sunar and Karmu Sunar challenging to the judgment and
order of conviction passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge,
Rourkela on 23.01.1998 in Sessions Trial No.110/43 of 1995.
2.                 As it reveals on record, prosecution case is that the
deceased-Jiten       Sunar,     daughter       of  P.W.1-Jamuna        Sahoo,      was
suspected to be practicing witchcraft.             It is alleged that on 3rd July,
1994 at about noon time when the deceased together with her

                               2
mother(P.W.1) and aunt(P.W.2) were returning to home from the field,
on the village road near the house of accused-Kandra, she was
obstructed and detained by accused-Karmu.         Accused-Kandra, who
was also present there, brought out a bhujali concealed on his
backside and dealt a blow to the belly of the deceased. On sustaining
that blow when the deceased fell down with bleeding injury, accused-
Kandra dealt 2 to 3 successive blows on her and because of such
injuries inflicted, the deceased died at the spot. It was alleged in the
FIR that in the process of assault on the deceased by accused-Kandra,
the other accused, Karmu shared the common intention by holding the
hands of the deceased. The informant, the deceased and the accused
persons are rustic adivasis. Three other accused persons also faced
the trial together with the appellants and they were charged with the
offence under Sections 302/109 IPC. In course of trial, prosecution
examined P.Ws.1 and 2, as the witnesses to the occurrence and P.W.7,
the doctor, who conducted the postmortem examination, and proved
the postmortem report(Ext.5) and the opinion report(Ext.6).      It also
examined other witnesses relating to seizure of the incriminating
materials, inquest and other aspect of investigation. The weapon of
offence was marked M.O.I.
3.               On assessment of evidence, trial court found evidence
of P.W.1 to be worthy of credence notwithstanding conduct of P.W.2,
who turned hostile to the prosecution, and referring to the medical
evidence and finding death of the deceased to be homicidal, learned
Addl. Sessions Judge found both the accused persons guilty of the
offence under Section 302/34 IPC and sentenced each of them to
undergo imprisonment for life.      Learned Addl. Sessions Judge also
recorded finding that notwithstanding the discrepancies about the
participation of accused-Karmu, the evidence of P.W.1 in examination-
in-chief so also the narration of events in the FIR (Ext.2) is sufficient
enough to prove the accusation against accused Karmu.           Learned
Addl. Sessions Judge, however, found deficiency of evidence to connect

                                 3
the remaining three accused persons with the crime as abettors.
Accordingly, he acquitted them of the charge under Section 302/109
IPC.
4.               Miss. Bijaylaxmi Tripathy, learned counsel for the
appellants, argues before us that contradictions in the evidence of
P.W.1 together with the conduct of P.W.2 in resiling from her earlier
version is sufficient to entertain doubt on the veracity of P.W.1 and
that situation should go in favour of the accused persons. In reply,
Mr. Khuntia, learned Addl. Government Advocate submits that
evidence of P.W.1 is clear and clinching so as to fasten the accusation
against accused Kandra and under such circumstance he cannot
escape the order of conviction.
5.               In view of the aforesaid contention, we asked the
parties to place the relevant evidence on record including that of P.W.7
inasmuch as learned Addl. Sessions Judge failed in his duty to
address himself first on the question as to whether the deceased
suffered a homicidal death.       It is indeed a matter of regret that a
judicial officer vested with the power of undertaking a sessions trial
failed to comprehend such a fundamental position while trying a
session case for the offence of murder.
6.               We address ourselves to the evidence of P.W.7 and the
postmortem report, Ext.5 so also the opinion report, Ext.6. It appears
from such evidence that P.W.7 found-
                 (i)   Cut injury of the size 2 ½” x 1” x depth
                       extending to vertebra on the ventral aspect
                       of the neck.
                 (ii)  Incised wound of the size 1” x ½” x skin
                       depth, placed on the nape of the neck
                       (front side).
                 (iii) Incised wound of the size 1” x 1/3” x skin
                       depth, placed on the lateral aspect of the
                       abdomen at the level of the umbilicus.

                                 4
According to the opinion of P.W.7, because of the aforesaid injury no.(i)
the trachea and major blood vessels of the neck were completely cut
and the death of the deceased was due to haemorrhage and shock and
cutting of the air-ways. He also opined that all the injuries were ante
mortem and such injuries are sufficient in ordinary course of nature to
cause death of the deceased.       He has also opined that the injuries
found on the dead body are possible by M.O.I.            There is some
controversy, which was confronted in cross-examination, as to whether
M.O.I is that weapon of offence. But notwithstanding that, evidence of
P.W.7 clearly proves that deceased suffered a homicidal death and,
therefore, we record the finding in favour of the prosecution that the
deceased suffered homicidal death.
7.               Reverting to the contentions raised by the parties, we
find that evidence of P.W.1 is clear enough to describe that it was
accused Kandra who dealt the blows on the belly and the neck of the
deceased by means of a bhujali. She confused regarding identity of
M.O.I as that weapon. If that confusion is capitalized, then it may be
said that prosecution has not clearly established if M.O.I is the weapon
of offence. For that reason, if M.O.I is eliminated, then in the absence
of recovery or seizure of any other weapon it may be said that weapon
of offence was not spotted and seized. In a case of this nature, non-
recovery of the weapon of offence cannot be a ground to excuse the
offender, if it is proved clearly on record that he is the author of the
injuries. Such a principle has been followed by the trial court and we
find no illegality in that approach.    Therefore, on assessment of the
evidence of P.W.1 we find that her evidence is not only credit worthy
but also sufficient to prove that accused Kandra is the author of the
injuries which resulted in homicidal death of the deceased.          The
contradictions between the evidence of P.W.1 in examination-in-chief
and cross-examination are regarding the participation of accused
Karmu and that aspect of the case shall be dealt with a litter later.
Evidence of P.W.2 declining to make any allegation against the

                                 5
accused persons does not shake credibility of P.W.1.        Under such
circumstance, notwithstanding the conduct of P.W.2, who turned
hostile to the prosecution, evidence of P.W.1 is clear enough to prove
that accused Kandra dealt the blows, which resulted in homicidal
death of the deceased.
8.               Alternatively, Miss. Tripathy argues and learned Addl.
Government Advocate does not seriously dispute that evidence against
Karmu relating to the allegation of sharing the common intention by
holding the hands of the deceased is contradictory and shaky. In fact,
in her evidence P.W.1 in examination-in-chief made such an allegation
but in para 3 of her deposition she stated that-
          “First Karmu came and caught hold me. When Kandra
          assaulted my daughter, then Karmu caught hold me.
          First kandra stabbed to the belly of my daughter, as a
          result she fell down. After she fell down Kandra dealt
          blow to the neck. Karmu left the spot leaving me and
          thereafter Kandra cut the neck of my daughter. Kandra
          stabbed to the belly of my daughter once only.”
  P.W.2, as noted above, turned hostile to the prosecution and,
  therefore, learned Public Prosecutor confronted her with her previous
  statement and that may project the prosecution case. At such stage,
  learned Public Prosecutor did not give any suggestion to P.W.2 nor did
  he confront her with any statement that accused Karmu participated
  in the occurrence by holding the hands of the deceased.       Learned
  Addl. Sessions Judge did not evaluate the aforesaid fact situation and
  the evidence and was swayed away by the evidence of P.W.1 in the
  examination-in-chief so as to record finding that accused Karmu is
  also responsible for death of the deceased. On proper appreciation of
  evidence on record, we find that learned Addl. Sessions Judge missed
  the aforesaid two evidence and, therefore, he committed the mistake.
  Undoubtedly, due to the confusion, which arises from the evidence of
  P.W.1, as quoted above, and the evidence of P.W.2, benefit arises in
  favour of accused Karmu and he is entitled to the benefit of doubt in

                               6
 respect of the charge under Section 302/34 IPC.       We, accordingly,
 extend the same benefit and acquit him of the charge by setting aside
 the order of conviction and sentence passed against him.
 9.             We experience while hearing cases that in the area
 dominated by the adivasi population the belief of witchcraft and
 combating the same by taking law into their own hands is a common
 feature by the persons who feel that they were grossly affected by
 practice of witchcraft. Accused Kandra is no exception to that feeling
 and that might have prompted him to commit the aforesaid murder.
 Therefore, this aspect may be considered by the Government in case
 there is any application/recommendation for his premature release on
 completion of 14 years imprisonment.        With this observation, we
 confirm the order of conviction of accused-Kandra and also the
 sentence of imprisonment for life and allow the Jail Criminal Appeal
 with respect to accused-Karmu.
 10.            The Jail Criminal Appeal is accordingly allowed in part.
 Accused Karmu be set at liberty forthwith if his detention is not
 required in jail in connection with any other case.
