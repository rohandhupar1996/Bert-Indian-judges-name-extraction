                               JUDGMENT
    PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
    Date of Hearing: 11.12.2017        &      Date of Judgment: 20.12.2017
Dr.A.K.RATH, J.    The plaintiffs are the appellants against a reversing
    judgment in a suit for permanent injunction.
    2.          The case of the plaintiffs was that Pankaj and Kapila
    were two brothers. Pankaj had two sons, namely, Dwija and Kusuna.
    Dwija died in the year 1981 leaving behind his wife Labani-plaintiff

                                     2
no.1 and one daughter, namely, Srimati, defendant no.7. Kusuna
died in the year 1980 leaving behind his three sons, namely, Ram
Chandra, Chandramani and Indramani, defendants 1 to 3 and three
daughters, namely, Malati, Ahalya and Charu, defendants 4 to 6.
Subash is the son of Kapila. He possessed his separate share. Dwija
and Kusuna were separated. There was severance of joint family
property by metes and bounds. Dwija adopted Sarat, plaintiff no.2.
There was a giving and taking ceremony in presence of the villagers
and relations. After death of Dwija, plaintiff no.1 executed a deed of
acknowledgement of adoption-cum-gift deed on 4.1.1982 in favour of
plaintiff no.2. Plaintiffs 1 and 2 were in possession of the property of
Dwija. Since the defendants threatened to dispossess them, they
instituted the suit seeking the relief mentioned supra.
3.           Defendants 1 to 3 resisted the claim of the plaintiffs
mainly on the ground that Kapila was issueless. Kapila adopted
Dwija. Thus, Dwija had no right to inherit any property from the
branch of Pankaj. After death of Pankaj, Kusuna inherited the
property being the sole surviving heir. After death of Kusuna, the
defendants succeeded to the property.
4.           Stemming on the pleadings of the parties, the learned
trial court framed five issues. Parties led evidence. The suit was
decreed. The defendants 1 to 3 filed T.A.No.25 of 1986. The learned
appellate court set aside the judgment and remitted the matter back
for de novo hearing. After remand, the learned trial court again
upheld the contention of the plaintiffs on the question of adoption
and decreed the suit. The defendants 1 to 3 filed T.A.No.7 of 1992
before the learned Sub-Judge, Jagatsinghpur, which was allowed. It

                                   3
is apt to state here that during pendency of the Second Appeal,
appellant no.1 died.
5.          The Second Appeal was admitted on the following
substantial questions of law:
            “1.   Whether the lower appellate court was entitled to
                  apply the theory of ancient adoption in coming to
                  its conclusion on the question as to whether Dwija
                  is the adopted son of Kapila or not.”
            2.    Whether the decision of Consolidation Authority
                  that Dwija is the adopted son of Kapila, shall
                  operate as res judicata in the suit ?”
6.          Heard Mr.Bibekananda Bhuyan, learned Advocate along
with Mr.Manoj Kumar Behera, learned Advocate for the appellants
and Mr.Ramakanta Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate along with
Mr.Kalayan     Kumar    Mohapatra,    learned     Advocate  for   the
respondents.
7.          Mr.Bhuyan,     learned   Advocate    for   the appellants
submitted that Dwija is the son of Pankaj. He is not the adopted son
of Kapila. There is no pleading with regard to giving and taking
ceremony. The finding of the learned appellate court that instant is
a case of ancient adoption is perverse since one D.W.1 deposed that
he was a witness when the adoption took place. In view of the same,
the court cannot proceed with assumption that the evidence
regarding actual giving and taking is lost. The learned appellate
court erred in law in holding inter alia that the finding of the
Consolidation Authority regarding adoption will operate as res
judicata inasmuch as the finding was rendered when the civil suit
was pending where adoption was the main issue. The finding of the

                                    4
Consolidation Authority shall not operate as res judicata. The
learned appellate court brushed aside the documentary evidence on
record as well as admission of the defendants. Non-consideration of
the same vitiates the judgment.
8.           Per contra, Mr.Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate for the
respondents submitted that issue of adoption has been set at rest by
the Consolidation Authority. The matter in issue was directly and
substantially before the Consolidation Authority. If the issue of title
is dependent upon adoption, the said issue can be decided by the
Consolidation Authority ancillarily and incidentally. The issue of
adoption has been decided by the Consolidation Authority. The same
cannot be reopened in the present suit. He relied on a decision of
this Court in the case of Jairam Samantray Vrs. Baikuntha
Samantray, 70 (1990) C.L.T. 439.
9.           The area, where the suit schedule land falls, came under
the purview of the consolidation operation. Thirteen Objections
Cases were filed under Section 9 of the Orissa Consolidation of
Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation of Land Act, 1972 by the
respective parties to record the land in their favour. The same having
been dismissed, the matter was carried in Appeal Case No.32 of 1985
before the Deputy Director, Consolidation Authority. In a well
discussed     order   dated    17.10.1985,    the   Deputy    Director,
Consolidation Authority held that Dwija is the adopted son of Kapila.
10.          In Jairam Samantray (supra), a Division Bench of this
Court went in-depth into the matter. The Court posed the question
“Don’t the consolidation authorities decide such question of legal
character in cases after cases day in and day out ?” The Court held
that “If then the consolidation authorities have jurisdiction to decide

                                     5
the question as to whether a person is son by birth, by what logic or
law are they denied jurisdiction to decide if a person is son by way of
adoption. Sonship is acquired either by birth or by way of adoption.
They are the different modes of acquisition. If title to property as son
by birth can be adjudicated upon by the consolidation authorities,
we fail to understand whey adjudication of claim to title as son by
way of adoption should be out of bounds to them”. It was further
held that “the statement of law that the consolidation authorities
have no jurisdiction to decide the question of adoption, that being a
question of status, is not correct. In almost every case, consolidation
authorities are deciding the question of status but a declaration of
the law to the effect that the consolidation authorities have no
jurisdiction to decide the question of adoption, if such question
arises ancillarily or incidentally for adjudication of right, title and
interest in property, is insupportable.”
11.           The ratio in the case of Jairam Samantray (supra)
applies with full force to the facts of this case. The matter in issue
was directly and substantially issue before the Consolidation
Authority. Thus, the decision of the Consolidation Authority that
Dwija is the adopted son of Kapila shall operate as res judicata. The
substantial questions of law are answered accordingly.
12.           A priori, the appeal fails and is dismissed. Consequently,
the suit is dismissed. No costs.
                                                ……..……………………..
