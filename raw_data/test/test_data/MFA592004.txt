                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER(ORAL)
                   In this appeal under Section 30 of the Workmen’s
      Compensation Act, 1923 the Insurance Company has             challenged the
      Judgment and award dated 9.9.2003 passed by the Commissioner,
      W.C.Zone-III, Tezpur in Case No.17 of 2002 awarding compensation of
      Rs.1,06,257.60 and interest of Rs.33,162.64 as interest thereon along
      with future interest @ 9% per annum.
      2.            One Md. Naimuddin filed a claim petition before the W.C.
      Commissioner, Tezpur stating that opposite party No.1, Ashutosh Das
      being registered owner of a Mini Bus bearing registration No.AS-02/8677
      engaged him as handyman in the said vehicle. On 14.3.2000 while the
      vehicle was proceeding towards Hojai from Nagaon, it met with an
      accident at Singrapatty at about 10.30 pm whereupon claimant sustained
      multiple grievous injuries on his chest, left wrist and other parts of the
      body. He was immediately taken to Hojai Civil Hospital and subsequently
      treated at Nagaon under Dr. J Sarmah. Kampur P.S. Case No.16 of 2000
      was registered in connection with the accident. The claimant stated that
      the driver had a valid driving license as on the date of accident. According
      to him, he got Rs.2000/- per month towards salary and Rs.50/- towards
      daily allowance. It was also disclosed that the vehicle was duly insured
      under the National Insurance Company under Nagaon Branch. He claimed
      Rs.4 lakhs as compensation.
MFA No.59 of 2004                                           Page 2 of 6

        3.    The opposite party No.1 owner of the vehicle appeared and
        submitted written statement and contested the same. Opposite party No.
        1 also claimed that vehicle was duly insured under the opposite party
        No.2, insurance company and so liability if there by any shall be of the
        opposite party No. 2 only.
        4.      Opposite party No.2 by filing written statement denied all
        responsibility and liabilities and also raised objection in regard to accident
        and injury involved. On the basis of the pleadings put forward by the
        parties, the W.C. Commissioner framed the following five issues and put
        the parties to prove their respective cases:
              (i) Whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim?
              (ii) Is there any cause of action for the claim petition?
              (iii) Whether the claim petition is maintainable in the present form?
              (iv) Whether the opposite parties are liable to pay compensation as
                   claimed by the claimant petitioner?
5.       The claimant examined himself as PW-1 and Dr. J Sarmah as PW-2. Both
the witnesses were duly cross examined by the insurance company. Claimant
proved accident information report as Exhibit-1, Medical Certificate as Exhibit-15,
Prescription as Exhibit 2 to 14 and x-ray plates as material exhibits to
substantiate his claim. Deciding all the issues in favour of the claimant, the
MFA No.59 of 2004                                               Page 3 of 6

learned tribunal arrived at the finding that the workman was drawing Rs.4,500/-
per month from the owner towards salary and daily allowance and he was 22
years of age at the relevant time. Monthly salary of Rs.2000/- was taken for the
purpose of computing the compensation. Relying on the opinion of the qualified
medical practitioner, the learned trial court held that the loss of earning capacity
of the workman was to the extent of 40% and accordingly, compensation was
assessed as follows:
            40% x 1200 x 221.57 = Rs.1,06,257.60
        Alongwith this amount interest @ 9% per annum was also allowed. Thus,
        another sum of Rs.33, 162.64 was granted in addition to Rs.1,06,257.60
        The aforesaid amount was directed to be paid within 30 days and the
        insurance company deposited the whole amount with the W.C.
        Commissioner while it preferred appeal before this court challenging its
        liability.
6.     Having heard the learned counsel for the appellant, this court framed the
following substantial question of law:-
       “Whether handyman of a vehicle is protected under the insurance cover?
7.       I have heard Mr. A Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant. None
appears for the opposite party/respondent.
MFA No.59 of 2004                                             Page 4 of 6

8.      Mr. A Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant submits that while the
driver and conductor of a vehicle are statutorily covered under Section 147 of the
M.V. Act, 1988 there is no such provision for the handyman and so the benefit of
insurance covered cannot be extended to a handyman. He has placed reliance in
the case of R am ashray Singh –vs- New India Assurance Com pany Ltd .
reported in (2003) 10 SCC 664.
9.       In the case of Ramashray Singh(supra) , although Supreme court found
that over and above the risks which are covered by statutory provision of Section
147, parties are at liberty to enter into a contract by which the insurer may agree
to cover additional risk . In that case by considering the policy condition, Hon’ble
Supreme Court found that Kalashi was not covered under the said policy. What is
discernible from the judgment of Ramashray Singh(supra) is this that a policy
shall not be required to cover liability in respect of death or injury of an
employee or a person insured by a policy who is engaged in driving the vehicle
or engaged as conductor. But for any other person engaged by insured, he is at
liberty to enter into contract with the insurer for the purpose and the insurer
may agree to cover such additional risk on receipt of additional premium. This
means that if in a given case, the insured makes payment for any additional risk
like handyman in that case, handyman will be covered by insurance cover.
10.         Having gone through the aforesaid judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, there is no doubt that handyman of a vehicle may be protected under the
MFA No.59 of 2004                                             Page 5 of 6

insurance cover if the insured makes payment of premium to the insurer for that
and insures agreed to it. So in case, question of liability of the insurance
company would arise the policy document will be essential document to find out
as to whether any additional payment has been made by insured to insuer for
covering a particular employee. Herein in this case, the insurance company
having denied liability to make payment of compensation has not produced the
policy document before the Tribunal or before this court. I have also perused the
lower court record. The policy document is not found. Under such circumstances,
there is no material to come to hold that the insured did not make payment of
additional premium and that the insurer did not agree to cover the risk of
handyman. The insurance company not having led any evidence to that effect
either by examining its employee or by producing record, the sole substantial
question of law is accordingly decided against appellant . In the absence of policy
document , it cannot be held that handyman is not protected under the
insurance cover.
11.      In the result, the appeal is dismissed. No order as to cost.
12.      Stay order passed earlier stands automatically vacated.
13.       Send down the records.
