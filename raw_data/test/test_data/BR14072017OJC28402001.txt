                THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH

          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biswanath Rath, J.                   This writ petition has been filed assailing the
          orders under Annexures-1 & 2 passed by the competent authority
          under the Regulation-II of 1956.

                                   2
2.            Short background      involved   in the   case   is that
at the first instance, the regulation-II proceeding vide Regulation-II
Case No.24 of 1991 was initiated by one Bipin Dehuri against the
present petitioner and her husband Banamali Patra. After death of
Banamali Patra the petitioner is continuing with the case. One
Dasarathi Dehuri for his legal necessity sold the disputed land
measuring Ac.0.17 decimals Khata No.71, Plot No.201 in Mouza-
Sripadganj in      the town of Baripada        to the   petitioner for
consideration of Rs.170/- in the year 1960 by virtue of an oral sale
and possession of the land was delivered by the said Dasarathi
Dehuri on the date after receiving the consideration amount and
from the said date the husband of the petitioner and the petitioner
were being occupying the land uninterruptedly for more than 41
years. Subsequently, a sale deed was also executed in the year
1963. The case history further discloses that after about 31 years
after the sale of the disputed land and delivery of possession, Bipin
Dehuri, S/o-Dasarathi Dehuri filed a Regulation-II Case bearing
No.24 of 1991 for restoration of the disputed land on the premises
that no such permission was obtained from the competent
authority before the sale transaction is conducted. Petitioner
appeared before the opposite party No.2 and filed her written
objection making her claim that she had perfected her title by way
of adverse possession. Regulation-II case No.24 of 1991 was
dismissed on the premises that the sale transaction had taken
place without having permission of the competent authority. The
petitioner preferred Regulation-II appeal No.1 of 1995 before the
opposite party No.1 and claimed for setting aside of the order
passed by the original authority on the premises of her acquiring
the title by way of adverse possession. The appeal was also
dismissed confirming the direction of the original authority for
restoration of the land in favour of the tribe persons.

                                 3
3.           Sri S.S. Das, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
the petitioner objecting the reason and the findings assigned by
both the authorities, submitted that the impugned orders are
wrong for being passed in non-consideration of the claim of the
petitioner over the disputed property for creation of a right in her
favour by virtue of adverse possession and further the development
through the R.O.R and the mutation proceeding have also not been
taken into consideration by both the authorities. It is under the
above premises, Sri S.S. Das, learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the petitioner contented that both the orders remained bad in
law and ought to be interfered with and set aside.
4.           Relying on some decisions as reported in AIR 2001 SC
393, Vol.101(2006) CLT 20 (DB) and 1987 (1) OLR-263 (DB) Sri
Das,   learned   Senior  Advocate   appearing   for  the   petitioner
contended that the decisions hereinabove have a great support to
the petitioner’s case and further the claim that since the dispute
involves as to whether the private opposite parties belong to
scheduled tribe or not having not gone into by both the authorities,
the impugned order should be interfered with and remitted back
for a decision on such issue.
5.           Sri  K.K.  Mishra,  learned   Additional  Government
Advocate for the opposite party Nos.1 & 2 contended that it
appears from the pleadings allthrough that the entire claim of the
petitioner and her husband was based on a right over the disputed
property being created by virtue of adverse possession. Learned
Additional Government Advocate next contended that for the
decision of the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case in between
Amarendra Pratap Singh vs. Tej Bahadur Prajapati & Ors. as

                                  4
reported in AIR 2004 SCC 3782 no right involving the property of
a scheduled tribe can be claimed by non-tribe taking the aid of
adverse possession. Further, with regard to the objections of the
petitioner as to whether the private opposite party belong to
scheduled tribe or not for being not raised at any stage, the
petitioner is precluded from raising such an objection in a
proceeding under Article 227 of the Constitution of the India. It is
under    the  above   premises,   learned    Additional Government
Advocate contended that there is no infirmity in the impugned
orders leaving any scope for interfering in the same.
6.           Considering the rival contentions of the parties, this
Court finds, there is no dispute with regard to the fact involved in
the case that the predecessor of the private opposite parties were
the original land owner involving the disputed property. There is
also no dispute that there is a sale involving the disputed property
through a sale deed in the year 1963 but the question remains
here to be decided as to whether a non-tribe can raise a claim
involving a tribe property on the premises of her right being
created by virtue of adverse possession? And further in the event of
not raising of an objection as to whether the private opposite
parties and their predecessor belong to scheduled tribe having not
being raised during the original proceeding and the appeal
proceeding, such question if available to be raised in a proceeding
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Coming to decide
the question No.1, this Court finds, the claim of the present
petitioner alongwith her husband from the very beginning is on the
basis of a sale deed and then a claim of right over the disputed
property is made by virtue of adverse possession for their long
possession over the disputed property. There is no dispute that
there exists a sale deed. There is no dispute that there is no

                                   5
permission of the competent authority before the sale transaction
is entered into. There is no dispute that the record of right also
discloses the possession over the disputed property in respect of
the present petitioner and her husband but looking to the
proceeding under Section 3 of the Regulation II of 1956, it appears,
no sale transaction or transfer of property belonging to a scheduled
tribe is permissible in absence of a valid permission from the
competent authority. It also appears that, the petitioner and her
husband then shifted their claim on the basis of their right being
created by virtue of adverse possession involving a tribe property.
In absence of a valid permission from the competent authority, the
sale and the subsequent developments through R.O.R are all
redundant.
7.           Coming back to the claim of the petitioner on the basis
of adverse possession, this Court finds, the Hon’ble Apex Court in
the   case  in  between     Amarendra     Pratap    Singh    vs.  Tej
Bahadur Prajapati & Ors. as reported in AIR 2004 SCC
3782 in clear terms held that entertaining the plea of adverse
possession involving the Tribe property by Non-Tribes will frustrate
the purpose of Regulation-II of 1956 and no transfer involving the
Tribe property is permissible on the basis of creation of a right
through adverse possession. For the decision of the Hon’ble Apex
Court, this Court finds, claim of a non-tribe regarding right over
the property on the basis of adverse possession is legally
impermissible. Hence the authorities below did no wrong in
dismissing the claim of the petitioner on the basis of a right
through adverse possession. Coming back to the question No.2,
this Court finds, there is no pleading on the question if the private
opposite parties belong to the scheduled tribe or not in the original
proceedings, in absence of which the petitioner was estopped to

                                  6
take such a surprise plea in appeal. Be that as it may, since the
petitioner raised such an objection in the appeal, nothing
prevented the appellants to satisfy their claim in this regard and
the appellants therein are not justified in shifting the burden on
the private opposite party.
       Under the circumstance, this Court finds no infirmity in the
impugned orders. As a result, the writ petition stands dismissed.
No cost.
                                         ………………………..
