                 2.      The petitioner started service as an Extension Officer (Tech) on 8.5.1983
                 in the Industries and Commerce Department and was posted at the Chenga
                 Development Block, under the Project Director, DRDA, Barpeta (respondent
                 No.5). The Pay Scale of Extension Officer was Rs.620-25-745-EB-30-895-EB-35-
                 1313 and therefore at the entry point, the Extension Officer’s pay should have
                 been fixed at Rs.620/- P.M. with Date of Next Increment (DNI) on 1.5.1984.
                 Subsequently when Pay Scale was revised under the ROP Rules 1990, the
                 petitioner’s pay should have been fixed at Rs.1785/- with the next increment due
                 on 1.5.1989 in the Pay Scale of        Rs. 1375-30-1435-40-1635-50-1885-EB-50-
                 2035-60-2395-80-2875-100-3375. But instead it was fixed at a higher level at
                 Rs.1885/-. During the next Pay Revision under the ROP Rules, 1998, the
                 petitioner was entitled to the scale of Rs.3580-90-4480-120-4720-EB-120-5200-
                 175-6600-250-8100-325-8750 and at that stage his Pay should have been fixed
                 at Rs.5375/- instead of Rs.5900/- with Date of Next Increment on 1.5.1996. But
                 through the mistaken fitment in the wrong slab, the petitioner was paid higher
                 wages and after the mistake was detected, it is directed to be rectified through
                 the letter dated 4.12.2007 (Annexure-5), issued by the Accountant General
                 (A&E).
                 3.      While the employee accepts that excess salary was paid, on the issue of
                 recovery, he however contends that overdrawal should not be allowed to be
                 recovered after so many years since the petitioner himself pointed out on
                 6.7.1985 (Page-14) to the Project Director, Barpeta that he was paid higher
                 salary and requested for taking rectificatory steps. Therefore Mr. G. Uddin, the
                 learned Counsel submits that as the departmental authorities failed to take
                 corrective measures despite being cautioned by the petitioner himself, the
                 overdrawal because of the departmental mistake, should not be allowed to be
                 recovered from the employee, as he had no role in the matter.
                 4.      On the other hand, Mr. R.K. Talukdar, the learned Counsel appearing for
                 the A.G. submits that when the petitioner was promoted to the Gazetted post of
                 Superintendent, his Service Book during the non-gazetted period was required to
                 be verified by the office of the A.G (respondent No.4) and at that stage, the
WP(C) No.1022/2008
                                                                              Page 2 of 4

                                                           3
                 higher payment came to light and this is how the impugned direction was issued
                 for correction and recovery of the overdrawn amount.
                 5.       In the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent No.2 on 27.6.2008, the
                 employer has admitted that the Basic Pay was mistakenly pegged at a higher
                 level and accordingly it is argued by Mr. J. Handique, the learned Government
                 Advocate that the excess drawal can’t be retained by the employee.
                 6.       In order to project that the petitioner can’t be faulted for the higher
                 drawal and that he informed in writing to his employer for correction, as far back
                 as on 6.7.1985, the necessary averments are made in paragraph-4 of the writ
                 petition. But this specific averment about intimating the Project Director of
                 Barpeta has remained unanswered in the counter-affidavit(s) of the employer
                 and also of the A.G. Therefore this Court must proceed on the basis that it is on
                 account of the employer’s mistake, the petitioner was paid higher salary during
                 the non-gazetted status of his service, as Extension Officer.
                 7.       But at the same time, it is nobody’s case that higher amount was not paid
                 to the petitioner since 8.5.1983 onwards till the mistake came to light, when the
                 petitioner was promoted to the gazetted status. Therefore the correction ordered
                 by the A.G. through the impugned communication dated 4.12.2007 (Annexure-
                 5), can’t legally be faulted. But the question is whether the overdrawal should be
                 permitted to be recovered from the petitioner’s salary? In All Manipur Degraded
                 Teachers Association vs. State of Manipur reported in 2005 (2) GLT 32, a Division
                 Bench of this Court had declared that higher pay granted to the Government
                 employees without any fault on their part should not be recovered. If we apply
                 the ratio of this judgment and take into account the petitioner’s personal
                 initiative through his written communication of 6.7.1985 (Page-14) to the Project
                 Director to correct his payable salary, it has to be declared that for the employer
                 fault only, the excess payment was made to the employee.
                 8.       The petitioner himself wrote to the Project Director for correction of his
                 payable salary but the same was unheeded by his superior and that is how
WP(C) No.1022/2008
                                                                                Page 3 of 4

                                                           4
                 higher salary was paid to the petitioner until the office of the A.G. detected the
                 mistake, at the stage of verifying the Service Record, when the petitioner was
                 promoted to the Gazetted status. In such circumstances and following the ratio
                 in All Manipur Degraded Teachers Association (supra), I hold that while the
                 rectification of the petitioner’s service book may be made and other
                 consequential benefits may accrue, the extra payment should not be recovered
                 from the incumbent. However the State authorities are at liberty to recover the
                 differential amount from the defaulting officers who failed to take rectificatory
                 steps, despite the written representation made by the incumbent himself on
                 6.7.1985 (Page-14). It is ordered accordingly.
                 9.       With the above order, the case is disposed of without any order on cost.
                                                                                            JUDGE
