      P R E S E N T:
                        THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K. RATH
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Date of Hearing :13.10.2017         │ Date of Judgment:23.10.2017
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         This is a defendant’s appeal against confirming
      judgment.
      02.           The respondent as plaintiff instituted T.S. No.48 of
      1992-I in the court of the learned Sub-Judge, Bhadrak for
      declaration   of   title, confirmation     of  possession,    eviction   and
      permanent injunction impleading the appellant as defendant. The
      case of the plaintiff is that one Bhabagrahi Barik was the recorded

                                    2
owner of the suit property as per C.S.R.O.R. After his death, his two
sons alienated the land to him by means of a registered sale deed
dated 16.8.1966 and delivered possession. The land was mutated in
his favour. He used to pay rent. After purchase, he demarcated the
land and raised fence. He had constructed a house over the same in
the year 1967. He had another house at 24 Pragana in the State of
West Bengal. He used to stay outside. The defendant married to his
sister. The defendant had purchased a land adjacent to north side of
the suit house. The defendant approached him to reside in the suit
house temporarily till completion of his house. He agreed to the
proposal of the defendant. Thereafter the defendant has been
residing in the suit house from the year 1969. The plaintiff
requested to the defendant to leave the house whenever the same
would be required by him for personal use. The plaintiff evinced an
intention to stay in the house to look after the properties of his
village. He requested the defendant to vacate the suit house. But
then, the defendant did not vacate the house. With this factual
scenario, the suit was instituted seeking the reliefs mentioned
supra.
03.           The defendant filed a written statement contending,
inter alia, that the suit plot was purchased by him in the name of
the plaintiff as benami. He could not mutate the land and record his
name in the M.S.R.O.R. He is in possession of the suit land. After
purchase, he constructed a thatched house on the southern side of
the suit land. In the year 1969, he had constructed an asbestos
house. The plaintiff is not in possession of the suit land. He is in
exclusive possession of the suit land peacefully, continuously and to
the hostile animus of the plaintiff for more than the statutory period
and as such perfected title by way of adverse possession.

                                    3
04.           On the interse pleadings of the parties, learned trial
court struck nine issues. Out of which, issue nos.5, 6 and 7 are
pivotal. The same are quoted hereunder.
              “5. Is the description of the suit land vague and
              indefinite ?
              6. Has the defendant made any contract to
              purchase the suit land and paid the consideration
              money to the vendors and purchased the same in
              “Benami” in the name of the plaintiff ?
              7. Has the defendant acquired the suit land by
              adverse possession ?”
05.           Both parties led evidence, oral and documentary, to
substantiate their cases. Learned trial court decided issue no.5 in
favour of the plaintiff. It further held that the defendant failed to
prove that he had purchased the property in the name of the
plaintiff as benami. The plea of the defendant that he had perfected
title by way of adverse possession was neagtived. Held so, it
decreed the suit. Assailing the judgment and decree of the learned
trial court, the defendant filed T.A. No.9 of 2000 before the learned
Additional District Judge, Bhadrak. Learned lower appellate court
formulated only one question that whether the defendant had
purchased the suit land as benami in the name of the plaintiff? It
answered the same in negative, confirmed the findings of the
learned trial court and dismissed the appeal.
05.           The second appeal was admitted on the following
substantial questions of law. The same are:
              “(1) Whether the learned courts below have
              committed an error of law in decreeing the suit filed
              by the plaintiff for declaration of right, title and
              interest and recovery of possession without
              considering the question of fraud with regard to
              execution of the registered sale deed dated
              16.8.1966 and without appreciating the distinction
              between fraud and benami transaction within the

                                     4
             meaning of Section 17 of the Contract Act and
             Section 3 of the Benami Transaction and Prohibition
             Act?
             (2) Whether the learned lower appellate court has
             committed an error of law in not addressing itself
             to all the questions raised before the trial court and
             in only confirming the judgment by answering one
             of the issues raised in the suit ?
             (3) Whether the learned courts below have
             committed an error in holding that the suit property
             was described properly so as to identify it even
             though the suit property constituted a part of a
             bigger plot, but it has not been mentioned in the
             schedule of the plaint as to in which direction of the
             plot, the said suit property is situated ?”
06.          Heard Mr. P.K. Rath, Mr. P.K. Sahoo, learned counsel for
the appellant, Mr. A.C. Mohanty, Mr. B. Pradhan, learned counsel for
the respondent.
07.          Mr. Rath, learned counsel for the appellant submitted
that learned lower appellate court fell into patent error in deciding
the appeal in one issue only. The defendant set up the plea of
adverse possession, so also non-description of the property. Learned
lower appellate court did not delve into the same and affirmed the
finding of the learned trial court. He further submitted that when the
first appeal was filed, it was the bounden duty of the learned lower
appellate court to decide all the issues. Thus the judgment and
decree of the learned lower appellate court is perverse. He relied on
the decision of the apex court in the cases of Santosh Hazari v.
Purushottam Tiwari (deceased) by LRs, , (2001) 3 SCC 179 and
M/s.Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. vs. Gustavo Ranato da Cruz
Pinto and others, AIR 1985 SC 736.
08.          Per contra, Mr. Mohanty, learned counsel for the
respondent submitted that plaintiff is the owner of the suit house.
His brother-in-law, the defendant, requested the plaintiff to remain

                                    5
in house. The plaintiff agreed to the same, whereafter the defendant
is residing in his house. The defendant has no semblance of right,
title and interest over the suit property. Both the courts below
concurrently held that plaintiff is the owner of the suit property.
These are essentially finding of facts. There is no perversity in the
same. He further contended that the core issue is whether the
defendant has purchased the property in the name of the plaintiff.
The same was answered in negative by both the courts. He further
submitted that it is not the duty of the appellate court, when it
agrees with the view of the trial court on the evidence, either to
restate the effect of the evidence or to reiterate the reasons given
by the trial court. Expression of general agreement with reasons
given by the court decision of which is under appeal would ordinarily
suffice. He relied on the decision of the apex Court in the cases of
Thakur Sukhpal Singh vs. Thakur Kalyan Singh and another, AIR
1963 SC 146,       Girijanandini Devi and others vs. Bijendra Narain
Choudhary, AIR 1967 SC 1124 and Lisamma Antony and another vs.
Karthiyayani and another, (2015) 11 SCC 782.
09.          In Santosh Hazari (supra), the apex Court reminded the
duty of the first appellate court. The apex Court held:
          “… The appellate court has jurisdiction to reverse
          or affirm the findings of the trial court. First
          appeal is a valuable right of the parties and
          unless restricted by law, the whole case is therein
          open for rehearing both on questions of fact and
          law. The judgment of the appellate court must,
          therefore, reflect its conscious application of mind
          and record findings supported by reasons, on all
          the issues arising along with the contentions put
          forth, and pressed by the parties for decision of
          the appellate court. The task of an appellate
          court affirming the findings of the trial court is an
          easier one. The appellate court agreeing with the
          view of the trial court need not restate the effect

                                    6
          of the evidence or reiterate the reasons given by
          the trial court; expression of general agreement
          with reasons given by the court, decision of
          which is under appeal, would ordinarily suffice
          (See Girijanandini Devi v. Bijendra Narain
          Choudhary). We would, however, like to sound a
          note of caution. Expression of general agreement
          with the findings recorded in the judgment under
          appeal should not be a device or camouflage
          adopted by the appellate court for shirking the
          duty cast on it. …”                (Emphasis laid)
10.          The apex Court in the case of H.K.N. Swami v. Irshad
Basith (dead) by LRs, (2005) 10 SCC 243, held:
          “3. The first appeal has to be decided on facts as
          well as on law. In the first appeal parties have
          the right to be heard both on questions of law as
          also on facts and the first appellate court is
          required to address itself to all issues and decide
          the case by giving reasons. Unfortunately, the
          High Court, in the present case has not recorded
          any finding either on facts or on law. Sitting as
          the first appellate court it was the duty of the
          High Court to deal with all the issues and the
          evidence led by the parties before recording the
          finding regarding title. The order of the High
          Court is cryptic and the same is without assigning
          any reason.”                        (Emphasis laid)
11.          In M/s.Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. (supra), the
apex court held thus:
          “27. In a matter of this nature where several
          contentions factual and legal are urged and when
          there is scope of an appeal from the decision of the
          Court, it is desirable as was observed by the Privy
          Council long time ago to avoid delay and
          protraction of litigation that the court should, when
          dealing with any matter dispose of all the points
          and not merely rest its decision on one single
          point.”

                                    7
12.          First appeal is valuable right of the parties. The whole
case is open for rehearing both on questions of fact and law. The
judgment of the appellate court must, therefore, reflect its conscious
application of mind and record findings supported by reasons, on all
the issues arising along with the contentions put forth, and pressed
by the parties for decision of the appellate court. It is the duty of the
first appellate court to deal with all the issues and the evidence led
by the parties before recording the finding regarding title.
13.          Learned trial court framed nine issues, out of which
issue nos.5 to 7 mentioned (supra) are pivotal. Learned lower
appellate court formulated one question and concurred with the
findings of the learned trial court and dismissed the appeal. It did
not delve into other issues. Thus, the judgment is vitiated.
14.          The decision in the case of Thakur Sukhpal Singh
(supra) is distinguishable on facts. In the said case, the counsel for
the appellant stated before the High Court that he had no instruction
to represent the appellant. His application for adjournment was
rejected. The appellant was not prepared to address the Court.
Thereafter the High Court dismissed the appeal. The matter went to
the apex Court. The apex Court held that the contention was
advanced before the apex Court that High Court had no jurisdiction
to decide the appeal after going through the record of the case and
judgment of the court below and must have complied with the
provisions of Rule 31 Order XLI, C.P.C. when the appellant did not
address the Court. The said decision is not an authority for the
proposition that the appellate court will hear the appeal on one issue
and either affirm or reverse the same.
15.          A priori, the judgment and decree of the learned lower
appellate court is set aside. The matter is remitted back to the

                                             8
learned lower appellate court for de novo hearing. For the said
purpose, parties shall appear before the learned appellate court on
24th November, 2017. Learned appellate court shall conclude the
hearing of the appeal by February, 2018.
                       The appeal is allowed. No costs.
                                                    ……………………………….
