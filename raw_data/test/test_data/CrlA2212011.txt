                                                                                           2
                          JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
(P. K. Saikia, J)
        This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 17.08.2011,
passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Sivasagar, in Sessions Case No. 141(S-
S)/2004 convicting the appellant, namely, Sri Cheniram Chutia of offence u/s 302
IPC and sentencing to him to imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs. 5,000/- i.d., R.I.
for another 6 months for the offence aforesaid.
2.      Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment, the
appellant Sri Cheniram Chutia (herein after referred to as the accused person) has
preferred this appeal citing several infirmities in the judgment under challenge.
3.      We have heard Mr. S. M. Sarma, learned counsel for the appellant and also
heard Ms. S. Jahan, learned Addl. PP, Assam.
4.      The brief facts, necessary for disposal of the present appeal           are that on
17.04.2002 at about 7 pm, while one Makhan Neog @ Mridul Neog (herein after
referred to as the victim) was returning home and reached frontage of the house of
the accused person, the accused person attacked him with a dao inflicting injuries on
his person which caused his instantaneous death.
5.       Having killed the victim, the accused surrendered before the police at
Sivasagar Police Station same day      at about 8.50 pm, with the weapon, reportedly
used in committing the crime in question and in that connection, a G.D. entry was
made. Next day one Sri Pradip Neog lodged a formal FIR with the O/C, Amguri P.S.
On receipt of the same, O/C. Amguri PS registered a case vide Amguri PS Case No.
27/2002 and ordered investigation.
6.      The police officer who was entrusted to investigate the case, visited the PO
during the course of investigation, conducted inquest on the dead body, sent the
same to hospital for post mortem examination, examined the witnesses, arrested the
accused person and did other things needful and on         conclusion of investigation, he
submitted charge sheet u/s 302 IPC against the accused person and forwarded him
to the Magistrate to stand his trail.
                                                                Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                         3
7.      The Magistrate before whom charge sheet was so laid, committed the case
to the court of Session since the offence u/s 302 IPC is exclusively triable by the
court of Session. On commitment of the case and on hearing the learned counsel for
the parties, learned Sessions Judge was pleased to frame charge u/s 302 IPC and
charge so framed, on being read over and explained to the accused person, he
pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
8.      During trial, prosecution has examined as many as 20 witnesses including the
informant, the MO and the IO of the case. Statement of the accused person u/s 313
CrPC was also recorded. He denied most of the allegations, leveled against him.
However, on being required, he declined to adduce any evidence of his own.
9.      On conclusion of trial and on hearing the learned counsel for the parties,
learned Sessions Judge, Sivsagar was pleased to convict the accused u/s 302 IPC
and sentenced him to punishment as aforesaid. It is that judgment which has been
assailed in the present appeal on grounds more than one.
10.     Mr. Sarma, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the judgment
under challenge is unsustainable in law since it was not rendered on the basis of
legal evidence. In respect of such contention, it has been alleged that prosecution or
for that matter learned trial court has placed heavy reliance on the alleged
confession which the accused reportedly made before the Magistrate during trial
quite oblivious to the fact that such confession is inadmissible in law.
11.      In that connection, it has been contended that such a confession was
recorded on oath which makes entire confession illegal and in spite of such a serious
infirmity in the confession in question, rendering it totally inadmissible in law,
learned trial court has chosen to place full reliance on such confession in coming to
the conclusion that prosecution has proved the charge u/s 302 IPC against the
accused person.
12.     It has also been contended that there is no direct witness to the incident in
question since all the witnesses on whom prosecution has placed enormous reliance,
they being PW 5, Sri Ajit Duta, PW 6, Shri Putul Dutta, PW 9, Shri Chanaky Chatia @
                                                              Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                         4
Baruah, PW 13, Sri Debojit Chutia @ Deb and PW 15, Smti. Kon Bhonti Chutia,
turned hostile to the prosecution leaving the prosecution case at lurch. When the
star prosecution witnesses turned hostile, it was not safe for the Trial court to
conclude that prosecution has proved the charge leveled against the accused
person.
13.     Even the other witnesses, namely, PW 1, Sri Pradip Neog, PW 2, Sri Prabin
Bora, PW 3, Sri Arun Bordoloi, PW 4, Sri Lalit Dutta, , PW 8, Sri Baba Bora, PW 10,
Sri Tapan Dutta, PW 11, Sri Prabin Dutta, and PW 14, Sri Dilip Kr. Baruah,           could
not render any evidence of convincing nature to show that the accused attacked ,
injured and killed the victim on the evening in question. Being so, according to the
learned counsel for the appellant, the judgment under challenge is required to be
interfered with and the accused person needs to be acquitted of offence 302 IPC.
14.     Alternatively, learned counsel for the appellant submits that if for one reason
or other,    this court comes to the conclusion that the accused was the person
responsible for killing the victim , yet then, the accused person could not have been
convicted U/s. 302 IPC. Rather, on the materials on record, he could have been
convicted U/s. 304 Part II IPC since there is enormous evidence on record to show
that the victim had profoundly provoked him to assault, injure and kill him on the
evening aforesaid.     He, therefore, urges this court to acquit the accused on setting
aside the judgment under challenge.
15.     On the other hand, Ms. S. Jahan, learned Addl. PP, submits that thought the
confession in question become unsustainable in law for the infirmity aforementioned,
yet, there are enough materials on record to show that it was the accused who
attacked, injured and killed the victim at his own house on the night in question. In
support of such contention, our attention has been drawn to the evidence of PW 6
who states, in no uncertain terms, that the accused had admitted to have killed the
victim on the night aforementioned.
16.     That apart, if the evidence of witnesses is read together, one would find
invariably that on the eventful night, the accused and the victim got involved in a
quarrel at the house of former and in that quarrel, the accused attacked the victim
                                                              Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                            5
with a dao inflicting his instantaneous death. Medical report completely supports
such projections that had emerged through the evidence of other witnesses.
17.     That apart, there is indisputable evidence on record to show that accused
had surrendered before the police immediately after the alleged incident, and that
too, taking the weapon of offence, same being the dao, in his hand. Such surrender
is a firm testimony to the fact that on the fateful evening the accused, and none
else, had killed the victim in his own house. She, therefore, urges this court to
dismiss the present appeal on affirming the judgment under challenge.
18.     We have considered the rival submissions having regard to the judgment
under challenge and the evidence on record. Before proceeding further, we find it
necessary to have a look at the evidence of Dr. Dilip Kr. Barua, who conducted
autopsy on the dead body on 18.04.2002 and who                was examined as PW 14 .
According to him, on 18.04.2002, he was posted at Sivasagar Civil Hospital. On that
day, he performed post mortem examination on the dead body of one Makhan Neog
and found the following:--
               “External Appearance:
                        Dead body of or adult man in fresh condition. Ghor mortis present.
               Body stained with clothed bloods.
               1).       Incised wound face over the nose extending transversely from right
               molar region to left molar region size- 3 x ½ x ½
               2)       Incised wound on the right side of the neck transversely placed size-
               4 x ½ x 2.
               3)       incised wound on right arm size 3 x ½ x ½
               4)       Left hand is completely disceted and separated at the wrist joint
               harvestly. The left hand is of the same deadly as the injured is of the left
               hand ear be opposed with the injured side of the left wrist.
               All the above wounds are ante-mortem in nature.
               Cronism and swinal cord-Healthy
               Throat—all the organs are healthy, hand is………. On both sides.
               Abdomen—All the organs are healthy muscles, bonds and goids- No fractures
               of the benes.
               Muscles and blood—on the right side are injured.
                                                                 Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                              6
                 Opinion- the cause of death in my opinion is due to shock and hemorrhage
                 from the wounds, described above sustained by the deceased.
                 Exbt. 7 is the post mortem report.
                 Exbt. 7(1) is my signature. Ext 7(2) is the signature of Dr. Anil Sharma, then
                 Joint Director of Health Services, Sivasagar which is known to me.
                 The external injury on the right side of the neck as described in serial NO. 2
                 the head wounds, abpnee’s pieast to cause death of the deceased. The
                 wounds can be caused by the dao Mat. 8 which is ……….. to me.”
19.      There was no serious cross examination to the evidence rendered by PW 14
and therefore, it can safely be presumed that death of the victim was homicidal in
nature and injuries which were ante - mortem in nature and which were                     found
inflicted on his body had occasioned such homicidal death.
20.      It is in this backdrop, let us consider the confession which accused person
reportedly made before the Magistrate during investigation. The confession was,
proved as Ext 5. A bare perusal of the confession reveals that it was made on oath.
It is a settled law that while taking confession, the accused cannot be subjected to
any oath and if it is done, the confession becomes inadmissible in law. Above being
the situation, we have no hesitation in concluding that confession aforesaid is
inadmissible in law.
21.      So situated, let us consider the evidence of PW 18, Sri Pradip Kr. Borgohain.
He deposes that on 17.04.2002, he was posted at Sivasagar police station as O/C,
thereof. On that day the accused Cheniram Chutia of Barboruah Tekela Gaon under
Amguri police station accompanied by Putul Dutta (PW 6) and Sri Monoranjan Dutta
(PW 16) came to the police station with a dao in his hand.
22.      Arriving at the police station along with the persons aforesaid, the accused
person admitted to have killed the victim         on that day at about       8.30 pm. He said
that on that evening at about 7 pm , the victim came to the house his house and
tried to drag him somewhere for which he got angry and then               attacked the victim
with a dao which he was using in cutting betel nut at that point of time. On receiving
such information, PW 18 made a GD entry which was proved as Exbt. 8.
                                                                   Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                        7
23.      PW 20, Sri Nanda Bora, deposes that on the fateful evening i.e., on
17.04.2002, O/C received an information over phone from Addl. SP, Sivasagar that
the accused person had surrendered before Sivsagar P.S after cutting a man in his
courtyard. On receipt of the same, he made a G.D. entry vide GD entry No.410
dated 17.04.2002. Such GD entry was proved as Ext 9. Thereafter on being required
by O/C, Amguri PS, he went to the house of accused person and found the body of
the victim lying in his courtyard.
24.     Next day, he visited the PO conducted inquest on the dead body, sent the
same to hospital and did other things needful including seizure of Motorcycle, stated
to be of the victim from the premises of the accused person and on the conclusion
of investigation, he submitted charge sheet u/s 302 IPC against the accused person
and forwarded him to the court to stand his trial.
25.     In his evidence, PW 6 also stated that on the fateful evening accused came
to his house and told him that he had hacked a man to death and left the body by
the side of the road in front of his house. Such evidence of PW 6 remains almost
unchallenged. The evidence of such a witness reveals that the accused did make
extra judicial confession . More importantly, such confession is found to be voluntary
and truthful.
26.      PW 2, Sri Prabin Bora, VDP Secretary deposes that on the fateful evening,
the father in law of the accused came to him and reported him that since his son in
law had been assaulted by victim on the road side, he got furious and requested
him to pacify the accused person.      Little thereafter, the wife of the accused and
father also came there stating same thing. At about 8 pm, however, the village Gaon
Bura came to his house and informed him that accused had taken shelter in his
house after killing Makhan.
27.     The evidence of PW 2, therefore, reveals that on the eventful evening, the
accused being battered by the victim got infuriated and about to cause greater harm
to someone, more particularly, the victim. Such evidence of PW 2 further fortifies the
evidence of PW 6 who stated that the accused had confessed to killing the victim on
the evening aforesaid and that too with a dao.
                                                             Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                        8
28.     We have also found that on the eventful evening PW 16 and one Putul Dutta
took the accused to the Sivsagar P.S. and handed him over to police with a dao
allegedly used in committing the crime. PW 8 and PW 11 too, depose that on the
aforesaid evening, they were at Sivsagar P.S. and found the accused surrendering
before the O/C of the aforesaid P.S. with a dao in his hand. There is nothing on
record to disbelieve such evidence and same fortifies more and more the
prosecution case.
29.     It is worth noting that doctor has noticed several cut injuries on the body of
the victim and according to him, such injuries occasioned the death of the victim.
The evidence of doctor, therefore, gives more and more credence to the testimonies
rendered by PW 2, PW 6, PW 8 and PW 16 which has drawn more support from the
testimonies rendered by PW 20, one of the I.Os of the case in hand.
30.     On considering the evidence on record, we have also found that on the
evening in question accused and the victim got involved in a quarrel on the road in
front of the house of the accused person. We have also found that the victim was
the person responsible for triggering the incident in question in which, the accused
got battered badly. Worse still, the victim, not being satisfied the assaulting the
accused again and again, returned to the house of the accused person in the
evening and tried to drag him somewhere presumably to assault him.
31.     We have found that when the victim came to the house of accused person
second time and tried to drag him to somewhere as stated above, the accused was
cleaning battle nut with a dao in his hand. When all those facts are considered in
their totality, one would find that the victim misdeeds had angered the accused
person provoking him to attack, injure and kill him at the house of accused person.
32.     Now, the question needs to be seen whether for such assault, the accused
could have been convicted of offence u/s 302 IPC. We have found answer to such a
query is clear ‘No’ since, as stated above, the victim provoked the accused
profoundly and under such provocation, the accused had attacked, injured and killed
him in the house of the accused person.
                                                             Crl. Appeal N o. 221 of 2011

                                                                                         9
33.     But then, in our opinion, the accused had exceeded the authority the law had
given a person to protect his person and property. In other words, though the
accused is held guilty of offence U/s 302 IPC by the learned Trial Court, yet, he is
clearly guilty of offence U/s. 304 Part I of the IPC. Being so, the accused could not
have been convicted of offence u/s 302 IPC. Rather he ought to have been
convicted of offence u/s 304 Part -I IPC.
34.     Accordingly, the conviction of the accused person stands altered from a
conviction u/s 302 IPC to a conviction u/s 304-I of the IPC.
35.     Considering all aspects, the accused is sentenced to suffer R.I for 8 years
with a fine of Rs. 2,000/- i.d., R.I for another 3 months for the offence aforesaid.
36.     The period which the accused has already spent in jail is to be set off against
the period of sentence imposed on him following alteration of conviction.
37.     The appeal is partly allowed as indicated above.
38.     Return the LCR forthwith.
