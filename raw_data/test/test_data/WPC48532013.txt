       Date of Judgment            : 28.8.2015

                     JUDGM ENT & OR DER (CAV)
        The order of transfer dated 26.4.2013 issued by the Director of Secondary
Education, Assam, together with the Corrigendum dated 6.7.2013, issued by the
same authority are assailed in the present proceedings. Be it mentioned that the
said order of transfer dated 26.4.2013 was issued in partial modification of an earlier
order of transfer dated 7.12.2012.
2.      According to the petitioner, he was appointed on regular basis as an
Assamese Language Teacher in the year 1994 at Sri Aurobindo Vidyamandir High
School, Ulubari, which is a Bengali Medium Linguistic Minority Educational
Institution, administered by its Managing Committee. At the relevant time he was
also nominated as a member of the School Management and Development
Committee (SMDC) by orders of the Inspector of Schools, Kamrup District Circle.
3.      The ground of challenge to the order of transfer dated 26.4.2013 is that it
stands vitiated on the principle of malice in law and not being based on any factor
germane for passing the order of transfer. It is contended that the order transferring
the petitioner out of Sri Aurobindo Vidyamandir High School, Ulubari was passed by
way of or in lieu of punishment on the basis of undisclosed complaint made to the
Director of Secondary Education, Assam by some members of the SMDC.
4.      It appears from the available records that following the complaint made by
some members of the SMDC to the Director of Secondary Education, Assam, a letter
dated 1.11.2012 was issued by the Director addressed to the Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Education (Secondary) Department, copy of which was not
served upon the petitioner. In the said letter dated 1.11.2012 reference was made
to the complaint received from the Committee against the petitioner of being a
person of unruly behaviour, a party to embezzlement, disobedient and prone to
uttering objectionable comments against the higher authority. In the said letter
dated 1.11.2012 the Director of Secondary Education also made subjective
comments to the effect that the petitioner was very often seen loitering in the
Directorate and in one occasion the Director himself had called him to his office

chamber and cautioned the petitioner not to visit the Directorate without valid
reason and without authority. The Director recommended his transfer to another
school from his present working place and to that end, sought for Government
approval.
5.     The end result of the complaint made by SMDC and the recommendation
made by the Director in his aforesaid letter dated 1.11.2012, was the order of
transfer dated 7.12.2012 transferring the petitioner from Sri Aurobindo Vidyamandir
High    School, Ulubari to Nagarbera Girls’ High School. In the said order it was
observed that the petitioner will carry his seniority. Challenge was made to the said
order dated 7.12.2012 in WP(C) 6033/2012 and this Court by order dated
14.12.2012 while observing that the petitioner had already been released on
10.12.2012, the respondents were directed to produce the
relevant records on the next date i.e. 17.12.2012 for consideration of the interim
prayer of the petitioner. Meantime, status-quo as on the date of the order was
directed to be maintained until 18.12.2012. During the pendency of the said Writ
Petition, the petitioner had made a representation to the Minister of Education,
Government of Assam highlighting his grievances and requesting cancellation of the
order of transfer. It appears that an endorsement had been made by the Minister
concerned on the body of the representation itself with direction to the Director of
Secondary Education to cancel the order of transfer. Pursuant thereto, the petitioner
by means of a Misc. Application i.e. Miscellaneous Application No. 475/2013 (in
W.P.(C) 6033/12) withdrew the case from file.
6.     The second chapter of the petitioner’s case commenced with the issuance of
the order of transfer dated 26.4.2013, so assailed in the present proceedings. By the
said order and in partial modification of the earlier transfer order dated 7.12.2012,
the petitioner was ordered to be transferred to        Guwahati Railway Colony High
School with immediate effect. A Corrigendum to the said order dated 26.4.2013 was
also issued on 6.7.2013 to the effect that “Guwahati Railway Colony High School”
should read as “ New Guwahati Railway Colony High School”. Pursuant to the said

order of transfer and issuance of the Corrigendum, the petitioner reported for joining
at New Guwahati Railway Colony High School on 2.8.2013 by submitting joining
letter. As the petitioner was not allowed to join in the school because of not being
released from his erstwhile school, a letter was also issued by the Inspector of
Schools, K.D.C. instructing the Headmistress of Sri Aurobindo Vidyamandir High
School, Ulubari to release the petitioner w.e.f. 1.8.2013 enabling him to join at the
new School. To overcome the stalemate, the petitioner was also constrained to file
Misc. Case No. 2815/2013 in the present proceedings as neither the release order
was issued from his erstwhile school nor his joining in the new School had been
accepted. By order dated 30.10.2013 in the Misc. Application, an observation was
made that the petitioner shall be deemed to have joined in the new school on
2.8.2013 and that he be allowed to take classes by regularly attending the new
school. Another aspect of the matter urged by senior counsel Mr. Tiwari is that for
the period between 10.12.2012 i.e. the date on which he was released pursuant to
the first order of transfer dated 7.12.2012 to join at Nagarbera Girls’ High School
and until 1.8.2013, the petitioner has not been paid his due salary.
7.      While narrating the facts above, Mr. Tiwari, learned senior counsel submits
that although power vests upon the respondent authority to issue order of transfer
in the exigency of service, however, the said power is circumscribed in the event the
same suffers from arbitrariness or is mala fide or is contrary to statutory provisions.
It is contended that in the instant case, mala fide is writ large on the part of the
respondent authority, in that the edifice of the transfer order is the complaint made
by the SMDC and the recommendation made by the Director of Secondary Education
which is hedged with subjective comments. The extent of mala fide, according to
learned senior counsel, is so deep that even the petitioner was not made aware of
the allegations made against him, short    of giving him any opportunity to rebut the
allegations. To reinforce his argument on the point of mala fide, Mr. Tiwari places
reliance in the case of Som esh Tiw ari -vs- Union of I ndia and others , reported
in (2009) 2 SCC 592.

8.     An affidavit-in-opposition has been filed by the respondent no.2 i.e. the
Director of Secondary Education, Assam. At paragraph-9 thereof, the complaints as
received against the petitioner has been reiterated to the extent that the petitioner
misbehaves with the members of the SMDC, has misused the official seal of the
school, received Rs. 80,000/- from Punjab Technical University towards holding
some examination and that he does not attend classes. The paragraph also states
that the respondent no. 2 being fully convinced and satisfied with regard to the
allegations made in the complaint, he had recommended his transfer to another
school. At paragraph- 10 thereof it is stated that in respect of the complaints made
against the petitioner, no regular enquiry was called for to determine the
performance of the petitioner. It is also stated that in the face of        such serious
complaint against the petitioner, the Director could not sit idle. Justification is made
that since the petitioner has been transferred by maintaining his seniority, the same
cannot be said to be by way of punishment. Mr. U. K. Goswami, learned counsel
while relying upon the statements made in the affidavit-in-opposition have also
placed reliance upon the Apex Court Judgment in the case of State of M . P . and
another -vs- S.S.K ourav and others , reported in (1995) 3 SCC 270 as well as
in the case of P .R . Sum iyon Vijayraj –vs- Union of I ndia and others , reported
in (2005) 3 GLR 353.
9.     From a perusal of the said affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent no.
2, what transpires is that the order of transfer had been initiated only on the basis of
the complaint received from the SMDC where serious allegations of embezzlement,
misuse of office seal etc. had been made. Copy of the compliant was not served
upon the petitioner. Statements made in the affidavit-in-opposition also make it
apparent that the allegations made in the complaint formed the basis of the
petitioner’s transfer to another school.
10.     In the case of State of M . P . and another -vs- S.S.K ourav and others
(supra), relied upon by Mr. U. K. Goswami, the facts therein and the grounds of
transfer are wholly distinct. Transfer order was issued on administrative grounds and
to that end, the Apex Court had observed that it is for the administration to take

appropriate decision and that such decisions shall stand unless it is vitiated either by
mala fides      or by extraneous consideration without any factual background
foundation. In so far as, the case of P .R . Sum iyon Vijayraj (supra) is concerned,
the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court referred to the case of M ozibur R ahm an -vs-
State of Assam , reported in 2004 (2) GLT 421 which explained the distinction
between “punitive transfer” and the order of transfer by “itself being punitive”.
Paragraph 9 in Mozibur Rahman’s case (supra) was reproduced, which reads as
follows:
       “9. Unsatisfactory performance on the part of the petitioner in the 2nd
       petition was the basis for his transfer to another school. The formation
       of opinion in this regard was the motive behind, which cannot be said
       to be the foundation. As observed by the Apex Court in the case of N.
       K. Singh (supra) several factors including suitability of the person and
       several imponderables requiring formation of a subjective opinion may
       be involved in the matter of transfer as in the instant case which
       cannot be regarded and/or taken into the fold of punitive transfer. In
       the instant case, the authority found certain irregularities on the part
       of the petitioner and to maintain the healthy atmosphere of the school
       in question in which the petitioner developed certain self-interest, the
       authorities resorted to the impugned action which in my considered
       opinion cannot be said to be illegal or arbitrary. The petitioner was not
       transferred solely on the basis of certain complaints. The procedure
       was adopted to verify the allegations through the subordinate officer,
       who in turn submitted a report and it was only thereafter on formation
       of an opinion, the impugned action was resorted to.“
11.    It appears from the aforesaid judgment that although unsatisfactory
performance formed the basis for transfer which also involved certain subjective
opinions, the impugned order of transfer was not considered to be illegal or
arbitrary. The formation of the opinion was on the premises that the petitioner
therein was not transferred solely on the basis of certain complaints. In fact, a

procedure was adopted to verify the allegations through an officer, who in turn
submitted a report and it was only thereafter on formation of an opinion, the
impugned action was resorted to. In the instant case, no such procedure was
adopted to verify the allegations made in the complaint against the present
petitioner nor the order of transfer was resorted to on the basis of any report
submitted by any subordinate authority. In that view of the matter, the two
judgments relied upon by Mr. U.K.Goswami do not come to the aid of the
respondents.
12.     In the case of Som esh Tiw ari (supra) relied upon by Mr. P.K.Tiwari, the
scope and grounds for interfering with an order of transfer by the Court was
reiterated. The Apex Court held that a transfer, which is ordinarily an incident of
service, should not be interfered with, save in cases where inter alia malafide on the
part of the authority is proved. Mala fide, as explained in the case, is of two kinds-
one malice in fact and second malice in law. Considering the facts in the reported
case, the Apex Court held that the order in question would attract the principle of
malice in law on ground that it was not based on any factor germane for passing an
order of transfer but based on an irrelevant ground that is on the allegations made
against the appellant therein in the anonymous complaint. The Apex Court held that
when an order of transfer is passéd in lieu of punishment the same is liable to be set
aside being wholly illegal.
13.     Applying the ratio laid down in the case of Somesh Tiwari (supra), there is
no gain-saying that the basis of the transfer of the petitioner to another school was
on the allegations made against him in the written complaint filed by the SMDC
authority. Indisputably, the order of transfer was not issued on administrative
exigencies, which may have prompted this Court to shy away from interfering with
it. Malice in law on the part of the authority in issuing the order of transfer is writ
large and, situated thus, the order of      transfer dated 26.4.2013 is liable to be
interfered with.

14.     The order of transfer dated 26.4.2013 being issued on the allegations made
against the petitioner, which attracts the principle of malice in law, is not sustainable
in law and is accordingly set aside. As a necessary corollary, the action of the State
Respondents in withholding the salary of the petitioner for the period between
10.12.2012 to 1.8.2013 is wholly unjust. The contention of the State Respondents
that the petitioner is not entitled to any pay for the dates on which he did not attend
the duties, is too far-fetched a proposition in the attending facts and circumstances
of the case. To uphold the stand of the Respondents would certainly amount to
allowing the respondents to take undue advantage of its own wrong, more so, when
this Court have found that the order of transfer was wholly illegal. In the
circumstances, a direction is also made to the respondent authority for payment of
the salary of the petitioner for the period between 10.12.2012 to 1.8.2013.
15.     Upon the setting aside of the order of transfer dated 26.4.2013, issued under
the hand of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam, read with the Corrigendum
dated 6.7.2013, a direction is made that the petitioner shall be taken back into
service as an Assamese Language Teacher at Sri Aurobindo Vidyamandir High
School, Ulubari. In so far as payment of salary of        the petitioner for the period
between 10.12.2012 to 1.8.2013 is concerned, the respondents concerned shall take
steps towards payment of the same within a period of three months from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order. The petitioner is permitted to furnish copy of this
order to the respondents concerned for their doing the needful in terms of the
directions above.
16.     Resultantly, this writ petition stands allowed and the parties are left to bear
their own costs.
