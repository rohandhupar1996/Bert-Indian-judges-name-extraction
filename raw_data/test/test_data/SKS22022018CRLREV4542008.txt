                                         2
S. K. Sahoo, J.       The petitioner in Criminal Revision No.635 of 2008
         namely Baishnab Charan Barik and petitioners in Criminal
         Revision No.454 of 2008 namely D.K. Singh @ Dusmanta Kumar
         Singh and K.C. Mohapatra @ Kishore Chandra Mohapatra have
         challenged the impugned order dated 27.02.2008 passed by
         learned Special Judge (Vigilance), Jeypore in G.R. Case No. 28 of
         2002 in framing charges under sections 420, 477-A and 120-B of
         the Indian Penal Code against all of them and the petitioner
         Baishnab Charan Barik has also challenged the framing of
         additional charge under section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d)
         of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (hereafter ‘1988 Act’)
         against him after rejecting the petition under section 239 of
         Cr.P.C. filed by the petitioners D.K. Singh @ Dusmanta Kumar
         Singh and K.C. Mohapatra @ Kishore Chandra Mohapatra for
         discharge. The said case arises out Berhampur Vigilance P.S.
         Case No. 28 of 2002.
                      Since both the criminal revisions arise out of a
         common order, with the consent of the parties, those were heard
         analogously and disposed of by this common judgment.
         2.           The prosecution case, as per the First Information
         Report dated 13.06.2002 lodged by Sri U. Rama Rao, D.S.P.,
         Vigilance, Rayagada Unit before the Superintendent of Police,

                                   3
Vigilance, Berhampur Division, Berhampur is that during enquiry
into the allegation of bungling in purchase of cement by the
officers of O.T.D.P., Kashipur during the year 1997, it came to
light that for execution of project civil works, it was decided to
purchase OPC 43 grade of IDCOL cement through authorised
stockists of IDCOL cement and to supply it to the contractors.
The cost per bag of OPC 43 grade cement was fixed to Rs.134.00
inclusive of all taxes, loading and unloading charges and
transportation charges from Rayagada to Kashipur. One J.E. was
entrusted to remain in charge of the store to receive the stock of
cement from the authorised dealer in good condition, maintain
the stock and store register and issue the same to the
contractors as per the orders of competent authority. He was
also to certify on the credit bills of suppliers of cement in respect
of receipt of the stock in good condition and to account it for in
the stock register. On the basis of the certificate of the store
keeper (J.E.), the bills were being passed for payment by the
Project   Manager.    During   the    period   from   14.11.1997   to
31.12.1997, the petitioner Baishnab Charan Barik, J.E. was in
charge of stores of O.T.D.P., Kashipur after taking charge from
J.E. Sri S.S. Nayak.

                                  4
            It is further stated in the F.I.R. that scrutiny of stock
register of cement and correspondence file revealed that during
the period 14.11.1997 to 31.12.1997 M/s. Sriram Enterprisers,
Rayagada supplied 10,000 bags of OPC 43 grade of IDCOL brand
cement to O.T.D.P., Kashipur @ Rs.133.60 per bag and received
Rs.13,36,000.00 paisa which was received by the petitioner
Baishnab Charan Barik as evident from the certificate given by
him on the credit bills.
            During enquiry at IDCOL godown at Khaliguda,
Rayagada, it was ascertained that during the above period, M/s.
Sriram Enterprisers had not lifted a single bag of OPC 43 grade
of IDCOL cement from the godown. The supplier also could not
produce any documents pertaining to purchase of OPC 43 grade
of IDCOL cement either from the IDCOL dealer or from any other
firm during the period and therefore, it was construed that the
petitioner D.K. Singh @ Dusmanta Kumar Singh, Proprietor, M/s.
Sriram Enterprisers, Rayagada supplied 10,000 bags of slag
cement to O.T.D.P., Kashipur instead of OPC 43 grade cement
and managed to get certificate from the petitioner Baishnab
Charan Barik who was the store in charge on the bills to have
delivered 10,000 bags of OPC 43 grade cement.

                                  5
             It is further stated in the F.I.R. that the petitioner
Kishore Chandra Mohapatra, Proprietor, M/s. Kishore Kirana
Store, Kashipur supplied 40,000 bags of OPC 43 grade of IDCOL
cement during the above period @ Rs.133.60 per bag and
received Rs.53,44,000.00 paisa being passed for payment by
Project Manager, O.T.D.P., Kashipur          on the basis of the
certificate of the petitioner Baishnaba Charan Barik on the bills.
The    inquiry  revealed   that  the  petitioner  Kishore Chandra
Mohapatra lifted 5430 bags of OPC 43 grade of IDCOL brand
cement from IDCOL godown at Khaliguda, Rayagada valued at
Rs.7,25,448.00 during the above period and he could not
produce any documents towards the purchase of 40,000 bags of
OPC 43 grade of IDCOL cement during the relevant period.
Therefore, it was construed that the said petitioner supplied
34570 of slag cement (IDCOL) to O.T.D.P., Kashipur and
managed to get certificate from the petitioner Baishnaba Charan
Barik to have supplied OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement. During the
said period, the cost of IDCOL slag cement was Rs.5.00 less than
OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement and other charges remaining the
same, the slag cement per bag was Rs.128.60 and accordingly,
the cost of 34570 bags of slag cement of IDCOL Brand came to
Rs.44,45,702.00. It is mentioned in the first information report

                                  6
that the petitioner Kishore Chandra Mohapatra derived pecuniary
benefits of Rs.1,72,850.00 paisa by submitting false bills in
connivance with petitioner Baishnaba Charan Barik.
            It is further mentioned in the F.I.R. that during the
period from 14.11.1997 to 31.12.1997, the petitioner Baishnaba
Charan Barik, being a Government servant connived with the
cement suppliers petitioners Sri D.K. Singh and Kishore Chandra
Mohapatra, falsified the official records and allowed pecuniary
benefits of Rs.2,22,850/- to the cement suppliers causing loss to
the project with ulterior motive.
3.          During course of investigation, it was found out that
the two firms namely M/s. Sriram Enterprisers, Rayagada and
M/s. Kishore Kirana Store, Kashipur gave their willingness in
writing to the Project Manager, O.T.D.P., Kashipur to supply 43
grade IDCOL cement @ Rs.133.60 paisa per bag which was
lesser than the rate of Rs.134/- per bag fixed by the O.T.D.P.
authorities. As both the firms were authorised IDCOL cement
dealers, the Project Manager placed orders with them to supply
OPC 43 Grade of IDCOL cement. Several notices were issued to
the cement suppliers i.e. petitioners Kishore Chandra Mohapatra
as well as D.K. Singh to produce the stock book, records relating
to supply of cement (IDCOL) to O.T.D.P., Kashipur but they

                                 7
failed to produce any documents. It was ascertained that during
the period from 14.11.1997 to 31.12.1997, the two agencies like
M/s. Sriram Enterprises and M/s. Kishore Kirana Store had not
purchased any cement from other cement suppliers of Rayagada.
During the period in question, the cost of slag cement was Rs.5/-
less than the cost of OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement per bag and
thus it was presumed by the Investigating Officer that due to
supply of slag cement by the cement suppliers, the Department
sustained   loss of   Rs.2,28,400/-.  The    Investigating Officer
obtained sanction order from the Engineer-in-Chief, Water
Resources, Orissa to proceed against the petitioner Baishnaba
Charan Barik. As the Investigating Officer found sufficient
evidence against the petitioner Baishnab Charan Barik to have
entered into criminal conspiracy with petitioners Dusmanta
Kumar Singh and Kishore Chandra Mohapatra and manipulated
records and documents of O.T.D.P., Kashipur showing receipt of
OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement and accepted the delivery challan
and credit bills submitted by the two firms as genuine and
thereby obtained pecuniary advantage of Rs.2,28,400/- for
himself and for the two firms, charge sheet was accordingly
placed on 30.12.2003 against the three petitioners under

                                 8
sections 420, 477-A and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and
under section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act.
4.          Mr.    Asok    Mohanty,   learned   Senior   Advocate
appearing for the petitioner Baishnab Charan Barik being ably
assisted by Miss Soma Patnaik appearing for the petitioners D.K.
Singh @ Dusmanta Kumar Singh and K.C. Mohapatra @ Kishore
Chandra    Mohapatra while     challenging the   impugned    order
contended that prima facie there are no clinching materials
available on record to constitute the ingredients of the offences
under which charges were framed against the petitioners and on
scrutiny of the statements and documents filed by Vigilance
police, there are no circumstances which would at least create
strong suspicion that slag cement had been supplied by the two
suppliers. It is contended that the prosecution has not tendered
any evidence that OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement is a restricted
commodity and it cannot be made available from any other
source excepting Rayagada depot or that the authorised agents
who were examined by Vigilance police were the only dealers of
IDCOL    cement.    It  is  contended   that  O.T.D.P., Kashipur,
Rayagada in their supply order stipulated three conditions:-
             i)    He should supply OPC 43 Grade weighing 50
                   Kg. net on each bag in good condition @
                   Rs.133.60 per bag.

                                 9
            ii)    The payment will be made soon after delivery
                   of cement.
            iii)   The undersigned reserves the right to cancel
                   the order at any time without assigning any
                   reasons thereof.
            It is further contended that at no point of time,
Junior Engineer, Asst. Engineer, Executive Engineer, Project
Manager or the Contractors complained that cements used were
not OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement. Moreover, during investigation
of this case, in the 161 Cr.P.C. statements, the witnesses have
stated that the contractors have used OPC 43 grade IDCOL
cement in the execution of the civil work.
            It is strenuously contended that after a long gap five
years since the execution of work, the case has been foisted
against the petitioners just to harass them and merely because
after five years, the suppliers were not able to produce any
documents relating to lifting/purchase of OPC 43 grade IDCOL
cement before the Investigating Agency, it could not have been
assumed that there was no supply of OPC 43 grade IDCOL
cement.
            It is contended that basing on assumption that the
petitioners have got pecuniary benefits by supplying slag cement
which was Rs.5/- less than OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement per bag,

                                 10
charge sheet has been submitted which is not sustainable in the
eye of law. The learned counsel placed reliance on the statement
of witness N. Gumpa Swami, Junior Engineer under whose
supervision, the construction works had been done. As per his
statement, he had lifted 43 grade IDCOL cement after signing on
the stock register and in all the works he had supervised, only
OPC 43 grade of IDCOL cement were used. It is contended that
the said statement of J.E. is also supported by the other
contractors who have been examined as witnesses by the
Investigating Agency. It is also contended that the civil work
done by O.T.D.P. was time bound project and within a short time
period, various types of civil works are to be performed and it is
not possible on the part of the suppliers to purchase huge
quantity of IDCOL cement from a particular godown. It is
contended that framing of charges suffers from non-application
of mind and therefore, it should be quashed.
5.          Mr. Sangram Das, learned Standing Counsel for the
Vigilance department on the other hand contended that for civil
construction work, the project authorities of O.T.D.P. decided to
purchase OPC 43 grade of IDCOL cement from authorised IDCOL
cement dealers and the purchase committee fixed the price per
bag of OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement at Rs.134/- inclusive of all

                                11
taxes, loading and unloading and transportation charges from
Rayagada     from  Kashipur.  Two   firms  namely  M/s.  Sriram
Enterprises, Rayagada and M/s. Kishore Kirana Store, Kashipur
expressed their willingness to supply the cement and since both
the firms were authorised dealers of IDCOL cement and their
quoted rates were lesser than the approved rate, the Project
Manager placed orders with them to supply OPC 43 grade IDCOL
cement. It is contended that the investigation revealed that
there was only one IDCOL godown at Rayagada and during the
period from November to December 1997, a total of 1532.350
MT of OPC 43 grade cement was received at the godown for
distribution to its dealers from the head office. M/s. Kishore
Kirana Store lifted 316 MT of OPC 43 grade cement (6320 bags)
from the godown whereas M/s. Sriram Enterprises, Rayagada
had not lifted any quantity of OPC 43 grade cement during the
period i.e. from 14.11.1997 to 31.12.1997 from the said
godown. The local cement dealers dealing with OPC 43 grade
cement were examined and they stated that they had not
supplied any quantity of 43 grade IDCOL cement to those two
suppliers during the year 1997. It is contended that as against
lifting of only 316 MT (6320 bags) of 43 grade IDCOL cement,
M/s. Kishore Kirana Store had supplied 2100 MT (42000 bags)

                                12
and against no lifting of IDCOL cement, M/s. Sriram Enterprises,
Rayagada had shown supply of 500 MT (10000 bags) to OTDP,
Kashipur. Therefore, the aforesaid two firms supplied slag
cements and managed to get certificates on their delivery
challans and credit bills showing supply of OPC 43 grade IDCOL
cement to O.T.D.P., Kashipur in connivance with the petitioner
Baishnaba Charan Barik who was the J.E. -cum- Store in charge
of O.T.D.P. It is contended that the two firms failed to produce
any documents relating to purchase and supply of OPC 43 grade
IDCOL cement to O.T.D.P., Kashipur during the relevant period
and thus by supplying slag cement whose cost was Rs.5/- lesser
than the cost of OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement per bag, the
department had sustained a total loss of Rs.2,28,400/- and both
the firms i.e. M/s. Sriram Enterprises, Rayagada and M/s.
Kishore Kirana Store had gained pecuniary advantage to the
tune of Rs.2,28,400/- in connivance with petitioner Baishnaba
Charan Barik. The learned counsel placing reliance in the cases
of State of Delhi -Vrs.- Gyan Devi reported in (2000) 8
Supreme Court Cases 239, Amit Kapoor -Vrs.- Ramesh
Chander reported in (2012) 9 Supreme Court Cases 460
contended that the revision petitions should be dismissed.

                                  13
6.          Section 239 of Cr.P.C., inter alia, provides that if
upon considering the police report and the documents sent with
it under section 173 of Cr.P.C. and making such examination, if
any, of the accused and after giving prosecution and accused an
opportunity being heard, the Magistrate considers the charge
against the accused to be groundless, he shall discharge the
accused and record his reasons for so doing.
            In case of State of Delhi -Vrs.- Gyan Devi
reported in (2000) 8 Supreme Court Cases 239, it is held as
follows:-
            “12. Section 397 of the Code vests the Court
            with the power to call for and examine the
            records of an inferior court for the purposes of
            satisfying itself as to the legality and regularity
            of any proceedings or order made in a case. The
            object of this provision is to set right a patent
            defect or an error of jurisdiction or law. There
            has to be a well-founded error and it may not be
            appropriate    for  the  court to scrutinize   the
            orders, which upon the face of it bears a token
            of careful consideration and appear to be in
            accordance with law. If one looks into the
            various judgments of this Court, it emerges that
            the revisional jurisdiction can be invoked where
            the   decisions    under  challenge   are  grossly
            erroneous, there is no compliance with the

                        14
provisions of law, the finding recorded is based
on no evidence, material evidence is ignored or
judicial discretion is exercised arbitrarily or
perversely. These are not exhaustive classes,
but are merely indicative. Each case would have
to be determined on its own merits.
9. Another well-accepted norm is that the
revisional jurisdiction of the higher court is a
very limited one and cannot be exercised in a
routine manner. One of the inbuilt restrictions is
that it should not be against an interim or
interlocutory order. The Court has to keep in
mind that the exercise of revisional jurisdiction
itself should not lead to injustice ex-facie. Where
the Court is dealing with the question as to
whether the charge has been framed properly
and in accordance with law in a given case, it
may be reluctant to interfere in exercise of its
revisional     jurisdiction     unless     the   case
substantially     falls    within    the    categories
aforestated. Even framing of charge is a much
advanced stage in the proceedings under the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
xxx          xxx           xxx         xxx        xxx
17. Framing of a charge is an exercise of
jurisdiction by the trial court in terms of Section
228    of   the   Code,    unless   the   accused    is
discharged under Section 227 of the Code.
Under     both   these   provisions,    the  court   is

                                15
          required to consider the 'record of the case' and
          documents     submitted   therewith   and,   after
          hearing the parties, may either discharge the
          accused or where it appears to the court and in
          its opinion there is ground for presuming that
          the accused has committed an offence, it shall
          frame the charge. Once the facts and ingredients
          of the Section exists, then the Court would be
          right in presuming that there is ground to
          proceed against the accused and frame the
          charge accordingly. This presumption is not a
          presumption of law as such. The satisfaction of
          the   court  in  relation  to the   existence   of
          constituents of an offence and the facts leading
          to that offence is a sine qua non for exercise of
          such jurisdiction. It may even be weaker than a
          prima facie case. There is a fine distinction
          between the language of Sections 227 and 228
          of the Code. Section 227 is expression of a
          definite opinion and judgment of the Court while
          Section 228 is tentative. Thus, to say that at the
          stage of framing of charge, the Court should
          form an opinion that the accused is certainly
          guilty of committing an offence, is an approach
          which is impermissible in terms of Section 228 of
          the Code....”
          In case of Amit Kapoor -Vrs.- Ramesh Chander
reported in (2012) 9 Supreme Court Cases 460, it is held as
follows:-

                       16
“19. At the initial stage of framing of a charge,
the court is concerned not with proof but with a
strong suspicion that the accused has committed
an offence, which, if put to trial, could prove him
guilty. All that the court has to see is that the
material on record and the facts would be
compatible with the innocence of the accused or
not. The final test of guilt is not to be applied at
that stage.
xxx          xxx          xxx        xxx           xxx
20. The jurisdiction of the Court under Section
397 can be exercised so as to examine the
correctness, legality or proprietary of an order
passed by the trial court or the inferior court, as
the case may be. Though the section does not
specifically use the expression 'prevent abuse of
process of any court or otherwise to secure the
ends of justice', the jurisdiction under Section
397    is  a   very   limited   one.  The     legality,
proprietary or correctness of an order passed by
a court is the very foundation of exercise of
jurisdiction under Section 397 but ultimately it
also requires justice to be done. The jurisdiction
could be exercised where there is palpable error,
non-compliance with the provisions of law, the
decision is completely erroneous or where the
judicial discretion is exercised arbitrarily.......”

                                 17
             The object of discharge under section 239 of Cr.P.C.
is to save the accused from unnecessary and prolonged
harassment. When the allegations are baseless or without
foundation and no prima facie case are made out, it is just and
proper to discharge the accused to prevent abuse of process of
the Court. If there is no ground for presuming that accused has
committed an offence, the charges must be considered to be
groundless. The ground may be any valid ground including the
insufficiency of evidence to prove the charge. When the
materials at the time of consideration for framing the charge are
of such a nature that if unrebutted, it would make out no case
whatsoever, the accused should be discharged.
7.           In the light of above principles, if the materials
available on record is analyzed, it appears that during the period
from 14.11.1997 to 31.12.1997, while the petitioner Baishnaba
Charan Barik as Junior Engineer was in charge of the stores of
O.T.D.P., Kashipur, stock register of cement and correspondence
file revealed that M/s. Sriram Enterprises, Rayagada supplied
10,000 bags of OPC 43 grade of IDCOL brand cement to
O.T.D.P., Kashipur @ Rs.133.60 paisa per bag and M/s. Kishore
Kirana Store, Kashipur also supplied 40,000 bags of OPC 43
grade of IDCOL brand cement to O.T.D.P., Kashipur at the same

                                   18
rate. Certificates on the credit bills in that respect were given by
the petitioner Baishnaba Charan Barik, J.E. The first information
report was lodged on 13.06.2002 and charge sheet was
submitted on 30.12.2003.
             The charges framed against the petitioner Baishnaba
Charan Barik read as follows:-

                 Dated, this the 27th day of February, 2008.
           The charges framed against the petitioners Kishore
Chandra   Mohapatra and Dushmant            Kumar Singh       read as
follows:-
           Firstly:- That during the period from 14.11.1997 to

           cement with connivance of the Junior Engineer, Shri
           B.K. Barik, who was in charge of the store of
           O.T.D.P. at the relevant time by delivering challans
           and   credit   bills  causing     wrongful    loss  to   the
           Government      to   the  tune    of  Rs.2,28,400/-     and
           thereby committed an offence punishable under

            and to supply delivery challans and credit bills to him
            for   manipulation    of  records   and   documents   of
            O.T.D.P., Kashipur and thereby committed an offence
            punishable under section 120-B of the Indian Penal
            Code and within my cognizance.
                    And I hereby direct that you be tried on the
            said charges.
                    Dated this the 27th day of February, 2008.
            The statement of the informant Sri U. Rama Rao
recorded under section 161 of Cr.P.C., inter alia, indicates that
during the relevant period, M/s. Sriram Enterprises         has not
lifted a single bag of OPC 43 grade cement from the IDCOL
godown situated at Khaliguda, Rayagada and M/s. Kishore Kirana
Store, Kashipur has lifted only 5430 bags of OPC 43 grade
cement but the suppliers have supplied 10,000 bags and 40,000
bags   cement     respectively   to  O.T.D.P.,   Kashipur  and  the

                                  22
petitioner Baishnab Charan Behera, J.E. had mentioned the
receipt of such quantity of cement bags of 43 grade in his stock
register. He further stated that the suppliers might have supplied
slag cement which was Rs.5/- less than OPC 43 grade cement to
get pecuniary benefits.
            Therefore, it is apparent that the statement of the
informant relating to supply of slag cement in place of OPC 43
grade   IDCOL    cement   by   the   two  suppliers  is based   on
assumption. The supply orders stipulated only three conditions
and it was not stipulated as to where from the suppliers would
procure OPC 43 grade cement. Merely because it was not lifted
from the IDCOL godown situated at Khaliguda, Rayagada in case
of M/s Sriram Enterprises and only 5430 bags out of 40,000
supplied bags were lifted in case of M/s. Kishore Kirana Store, it
cannot be assumed that the suppliers might have supplied slag
cement. Even if the Investigating Officer has examined some
other suppliers who used to deal with IDCOL cement and
obtained in writing from them that the two suppliers M/s. Sriram
Enterprises and M/s. Kishore Kirana Store have not lifted OPC 43
grade IDCOL cement from them but that would not be sufficient
to draw an assumption that the suppliers had supplied slag
cement. The logic behind drawing such assumption is fallacious.

                                23
Such an assumption could have been drawn after examining all
the suppliers dealing with OPC 43 grade cement and not few of
them. Most of the witnesses who have been examined by the
Investigating Officer were the competitors of the two suppliers
who had also submitted tender papers to supply 43 grade of
IDCOL cement to O.T.D.P., Kashipur and they were unsuccessful
and they have stated that they had not sold any 43 grade IDCOL
cement to either M/s. Sriram Enterprises or M/s. Kishore Kirana
Store, Kashipur. The contractors like Sarat Ch. Gouda, Bihari
Naik, Mangulu Charan Mandal, Sanjib Kumar Patra have stated
that they received 43 grade IDCOL cement for different project
works on different dates from the petitioner Baishnaba Charan
Barik and put their signatures on the stock register in token of
receipt. N. Gumpa Swami, J.E. who was supervising the works
has also stated that all the cements which were received by him
from the office of O.T.D.P. were of 43 grade IDCOL cement and
accordingly he had put his signatures in the stock register and
only 43 grade IDCOL cements were used in the works supervised
by him.
            The two petitioners Kishore Chandra Mohapatra and
Dusmanta Kumar Singh were examined on 04.07.2003 by the
Inspector of Vigilance and their statements were recorded. The

                                  24
petitioner Dusmanta Kumar Singh has stated that since cements
were to be supplied to O.T.D.P. on credit basis and he had no
sufficient cash to purchase from IDCOL cement depot, therefore,
he purchased 43 grade cement from outside and supplied to
O.T.D.P. and he further stated that since the purchases were
made in the year 1997, he was not in a position to tell from
which agency, he had purchased the cement. He further stated
that since he got back the entire dues relating to the supply of
cement to O.T.D.P., there was no purpose in keeping the related
documents with him. The petitioner Kishore Chandra Mohapatra
has also stated almost in a similar manner. The petitioner
Baishnaba Charan Barik was examined by the Inspector of
Vigilance Department and he has stated in detail how he was
receiving OPC 43 grade IDCOL cement from the suppliers,
making entries in the stock register and how he was supplying
the same to different contractors as per the orders of the
Executive Engineer or Project Manager after making necessary
entries in the stock register. He specifically stated that except 43
grade of IDCOL cement, he had not received the cement of any
other brand and further stated to have received the cement with
the challan copies. The original delivery challans of the suppliers
have been seized by the investigating agency.

                                  25
8.           Therefore, when the documentary evidence like stock
register, delivery challans indicate about receipt of OPC 43 grade
of IDCOL cement in the O.T.D.P. store of Kashipur during the
relevant period when the petitioner Baishnaba Charan Barik, J.E.
was in charge from the two suppliers M/s. Sriram Enterprises
and M/s. Kishore Kirana Store, Kashipur and the contractors
have also received cements of 43 grade of IDCOL brand from the
store after signing the stock register and all of them including N.
Gumpa Swami, J.E. who was supervising the works have stated
about   the   utilization of  43   grade  IDCOL     cement  in  the
construction works, merely basing on the fact that such cements
were not lifted from the IDCOL godown at Khaliguda, Raygada or
were not purchased from some of the dealers of IDCOL cement
of Rayagada district, the assumption drawn by the informant as
well as by the investigating officer that the two suppliers had
supplied slag cements cannot be accepted particularly in absence
of any stipulation in the supply orders to purchase OPC 43 grade
cement from a particular party or from IDCOL godown at
Khaliguda. Drawing of assumption suffers from non-application
of mind which is also not justified in the facts and circumstances
of the case.

                                  26
             For general construction applications, there are three
types of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) available namely, 33,
43 and 53 grade and it is graded according to its strength.
Specifications for these different grades of cement shall conform
to IS 269:2013, IS 8112:2013, IS 12269:2013 respectively. The
grade indicates the compression strength (MPa) of the concrete
that will attain after 28 days of setting. Thus OPC 43 grade
cement shall    conform   to   IS:8112-1989    and   the  designed
strength of 28 days shall be minimum 43 MPa or 430 kg/sqcm.
Compressive strength of cement is determined by compressive
strength test on mortar cubes compacted by means of a
standard vibration machine. OPC is manufactured by grinding
together OPC Clinker (95 – 97%) along with gypsum (3-5%).
             PSC or Portland Slag cement on the other hand is a
kind of blended cement manufactured by either grinding the
Portland clinker with gypsum and granulated slag or blending the
ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) with Ordinary
Portland cement. Normal composition of Portland slag cement is
40 % clinker, 5 % gypsum and 60 % blast furnace granulated
slag. As per IS:455, the quantity of GGBS can be in the range to
25 % to 70%. The minimum compressive strength requirement
is 33 MPa at 28 days for PSC Cement. PSC cement has less heat

                                 27
of hydration as compared to OPC cement. Slag cement is most
widely used in concrete, either as a separate cementitious
component or as part of blended cement. It works synergistically
with Portland cement to increase strength, reduce permeability,
improve    resistance   to chemical   attack    and  inhibit  rebar
corrosion.
            No field testing report or laboratory testing report
has been obtained by the investigating agency to substantiate
the accusation that it was not OPC 43 grade cement but it was
slag cement.
            In case of State of Bihar and Anr. -Vrs.- P.P.
Sharma reported in A.I.R. 1991 S.C. 1260, it is held as
follows:-
             “47. The investigating officer is the arm of the
            law and plays pivotal role in the dispensation of
            criminal justice and maintenance of law and
            order. The police investigation is, therefore, the
            foundation stone on which the whole edifice of
            criminal trial rests an error in its chain of
            investigation may result in miscarriage of justice
            and the prosecution entails with acquittal. The
            duty of the investigating officer, therefore, is to
            ascertain facts, to extract truth from half-truth
            or garbled version, connecting the chain of
            events. Investigation is a tardy and tedious

                      28
process. Enough power, therefore, has been
given to the police officer in the area of
investigatory process, granting him or her great
latitude to exercise his discretionary power to
make a successful investigation. It is by his
action that law becomes an actual positive force.
Often crimes are committed in secrecy with
dexterity and at high places. The investigating
officer may have to obtain information from
sources disclosed or undisclosed and there is no
set   procedure    to   conduct   investigation   to
connect every step in the chain of prosecution
case by collecting the evidence except to the
extent expressly prohibited by the Code or the
Evidence Act or the Constitution. In view of the
arduous task involved in the investigation he has
been given free liberty to collect the necessary
evidence in any manner he feels expedient, on
the facts and in given circumstances. His/her
primary focus is on the solution of the crime by
intensive investigation. It is his duty to ferret
out the truth. Laborious hardwork and attention
to the    details, ability to sort     out through
mountainous          information,        recognized
behavioural     patterns    and   above     all,  to
coordinate    the   efforts  of   different  people
associated with various elements of the crime
and the case are essential. Diverse methods are,
therefore,   involved   in  making     a  successful
completion of the investigation.”

                                 29
            In case of Jamuna Chaudhary -Vrs.- State of
Bihar reported in 1974 Criminal Law Journal 890, it is held
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court as follows:
            “11. The duty of the Investigating Officers is not
            merely to bolster up a prosecution case with
            such evidence as may enable the court to record
            a   conviction  but    to   bring    out   the  real
            unvarnished truth.”
            Therefore, I am of the view that the Investigating
Officer has failed to collect any clinching materials to proceed
against the petitioners and acted in a mechanical manner. On
the available materials on record, there is no prima facie case for
commission of the offences alleged against the petitioners. There
is no ground for presuming that the petitioners have committed
the offences alleged. There is no strong suspicion against the
petitioners. Submission of charge sheet is based totally on
unfounded     assumptions   and    it  has     resulted  in  causing
miscarriage of justice. The learned trial Judge has mechanically
dealt with the discharge petition filed by the petitioners and after
quoting the prosecution allegation, he jumped to the conclusion
that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the
petitioners  and   rejected   the    petition.   Therefore,  without
meticulous examination of the materials on record, I am of the

                                      30
humble view that the learned trial Court has committed palpable
error in framing charges against the petitioners after rejecting
the discharge petition and as such, in the interest of justice, the
impugned order cannot be sustained in the eye of law.
9.               Accordingly, both the criminal revision petitions are
hereby allowed. The impugned order dated 27.02.2008 passed
by the learned Special Judge (Vigilance), Jeypore in G.R. Case
No. 28 of 2002 in rejecting the petition under section 239 of
Cr.P.C. praying for discharge and framing charges stands
quashed and set aside and the petitioners are hereby discharged
from the offences charged.
                                                  ...........................
