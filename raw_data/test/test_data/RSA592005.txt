2.        This appeal is preferred by the plaintiff against the judgment and decree dated
08.02.2005, passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Nagaon in Title Appeal No.
18/2004 affirming the judgment and decree dated 09.02.2004, passed by the learned Civil
Judge (Junior Division) No. 1, Nagaon in Title Suit No. 48/2000.
3.        The appellant, Assam State Co-operative Marketing and Consumers Federation Ltd.,
a Co-operative Institution registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1949 filed a suit
against the Food Corporation of India and its functionaries praying for a declaration that
Office Memorandum No. S&S/DIF/Cost/97-2000 dated 02.05.2000 is illegal and
inoperative, permanent injunction restraining the defendants from recovering the
differential cost as mentioned in the aforesaid Memorandum and not to give effect to the
Memorandum No. S&S/Dif.Cost/97-98 dated 19.05.2000.
4.        The case set out in the plaint is that the plaintiff deals in procurement and
distribution of public distribution system (PDS) items. As per practice, on the basis of
allotment order, the Deputy Commissioner (F&S), Nagaon allots to the plaintiff as well as
other allottees quantities of rice, both under APL and BPL categories. In terms of an
allotment order dated 16.03.2000 for the month of March, 2000, the plaintiff lifted 500
quintals of APL rice on 27.03.2000 from the respondent No. 3 by depositing the value @
Rs. 905/- per quintal amounting to Rs. 4,52,500/-. Thereafter, the plaintiff distributed the
entire quantity to various co-operative societies and fair-price shops within 31.03.2000 at
the price fixed by the Department of Food and Civil Supplies, Nagaon.
5.        When the plaintiff went to deposit the value for the quota of rice for the month of
June, 2000 as per allotment, the defendant No. 3 refused to accept the amount and
directed the plaintiff to deposit an amount of Rs. 1,37,500/-, which is the differential
amount due for the month of March, 2000 because of enhancement of price of rice by the
Central Government, which was effective from 01.04.2000. In this connection, the
defendant No. 3 had issued a Memo No. S&S/DIF-Cost/97-98 dated 19.05.2000,
challenged in the suit, requesting the Deputy Commissioner to direct different allottees
including the plaintiff to deposit the differential amount within June, 2000, failing which, it
was indicated that defendants shall adjust the same from future deposit.
6.        A written statement was filed by the defendants justifying the Memo No. S&S/DIF-
Cost/97-98 dated 19.05.2000 and the demand of differential amount of Rs. 1,37,500/-. In
R.S.A. No. 59/2005                                                                     2|Page

support of the issuance of the Memo No. S&S/DIF-Cost/97-98 dated 19.05.2000, the
defendants relied on a Circular No. 200(1)/90-FC A/C dated 30.03.1993.
7.        The suit filed by the plaintiff was dismissed. The appeal preferred by the plaintiff
also met similar fate.
8.        The second appeal was admitted to be heard by an order dated 13.04.2005 on the
following substantial question of law:
                   “Whether learned court below erred in law in deciding that the
                   respondents/defendants are entitled to realize the differential value of the
                   food grains from the plaintiff the sale of which was complete prior to the
                   date of enhancement of the price entitling them to realize the differential
                   value.”
9.        The letter dated 30.03.1993 was exhibited by the defendants as Exhibit – C and the
letter dated 19.05.2000 was exhibited as Exhibit – G. A letter dated 02.05.2000 issued by
the defendant No. 3 to the Deputy Commissioner (F&S), Sub-Divisional Officer (C),
Sankardev Nagar and the Officer on Special Duty, KAAC/Br. Secretariat requesting the
aforesaid authorities to deposit the required differential cost for the period 25.03.2000 to
31.03.2000 showing allotteewise issue of food grains was exhibited as Exhibit – F. It is to
be noticed that vide Exhibit – C, addressed to all the Food Secretaries of the State
Governments and Union Territory Administrations, the change in procedure for recovery of
the differential cost from the States and the Union Territories on revision of central issue
prices of food grains for distribution under the PDS and ITDP, etc. was informed. In the
said Circular, Exhibit – C, it was stated that the release orders issued by the FCI to the
States/Union Territories and/or their nominees upto 7 days prior to date of revision of
central issue prices would be treated as the stock in pipe line on which the State
Governments/Union Territory Administrations and/or their nominees/agencies would be
required to pay the differential value between the old and the revised price within two
months following the revision of the issue prices. It was also informed that failure to do so
will result in stoppage of the issue of the further stocks of grains by FCI from June, 1993 or
issue of reduced quantity after adjustment of the differential cost recoverable.
10.       It will be relevant to extract Exhibit – F in its entirety, which is as under:
R.S.A. No. 59/2005                                                                       3|Page

12.       A perusal of letter dated 02.05.2000, Exhibit – F, issued by the District Manager,
Food Corporation of India, Nagaon goes to show that there was enhancement of central
issue price of food grains w.e.f. 01.04.2000 and in the context thereof, on the basis of the
circular dated 30.03.1993, Exhibit – C, differential cost against pipe line stock with effect
from 25.03.2000 to 31.03.2000 was directed to be paid, which in respect of the plaintiff,
came to Rs. 1,37,500/-.
13.       The aforesaid circular dated 30.03.1993 was subject matter of consideration in
Assam R oller Flour M ills Association Vs. State of Assam & Ors., reported in (2004)
1 GLR 223 . The Division Bench of this Court held that the moment purchasers purchase
the property with their own money, they become owner of the property at the price fixed
by the Government at that time and that price cannot be increased or decreased by the
Government by issuing orders fixing price from retrospective date. Accordingly, the
notification dated 30.03.1993 along with consequential circulars issued by various
authorities were set aside.
14.       A perusal of the letter dated 02.05.2000, Exhibit – F would go to show that the said
letter was issued on the strength of a circular that was already quashed by the Division
R.S.A. No. 59/2005                                                                        6|Page

Bench of this Court. There is no dispute that the plaintiff purchased rice on 27.03.2000,
before the issuance of the notification dated 01.04.2000 and therefore, this case is
squarely covered by the judgment rendered in Assam R oller Flour M ills Association
(supra). In Exhibit – G, there is a reference to the letter dated 02.05.2000, Exhibit – F.
15.        Mr. S.K. Chakraborty, learned counsel for the respondents has, however, submitted
that in Tinsuk ia W hole Sale Consum ers Cooperative Society Ltd. Vs. Food
Corporation of I ndia & Ors., in R.F.A. No. 40/2008, by a judgment dated 01.06.2015,
this Court had remanded the case on similar circumstances to the learned Trial Court to
enable the plaintiff to establish that the plaintiff had distributed the allotted goods before
the revision price came into effect. He has, however, very fairly submitted that though the
Division Bench judgment in Assam R oller Flour M ills Association (supra) was referred
to, the fact that the Circular dated 30.03.1993 was set aside was not noticed.
16.        P.W. 1, who was working as a Manager of plaintiff, deposed that within 31.03.2000,
the rice allotted for the month of March, 2000 was distributed to various co-operative
societies and fair-price shops. There was no cross-examination on this aspect though
otherwise the P.W. 1 was cross-examined. There is not even a suggestion that allotted rice
was not distributed before 31.03.2000. He asserted, in his cross-examination, that 500
quintal was not pipe line stock. Therefore, the plaintiff had even otherwise established that
rice allotted for the month of March, 2000 was distributed before 31.03.2000. On this
count, the judgment in Tinsuk ia W hole Sale Consum ers Cooperative Society Ltd.
(supra) is clearly distinguishable.
17.        Be that as it may, when the Division Bench had set aside the notification dated
30.03.1993, which was the basis for issuance of the impugned Memorandum No. S&S/DIF-
COST/97-2000 dated 02.05.2000 and Memorandum No. S&S/Dif.Cost/97-98 dated
19.05.2000, the appeal has to be allowed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the
impugned judgments and decrees of the learned Court below are set aside.
18.        Plaintiff’s suit is decreed. No cost.
                                                                          JUDGE
