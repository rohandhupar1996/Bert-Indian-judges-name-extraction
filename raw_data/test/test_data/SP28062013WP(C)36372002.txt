         PRESENT:
                  THE HONOURABLE KUMARI JUSTICE SANJU PANDA
Sanju Panda,J.    In this writ petition, the petitioner-management challenges the
         award dated 4th May, 2002            passed by the learned Presiding Officer,
         Labour Court, Bhubaneswar            in I.D.Case No.92 of 1996 awarding the
         benefit of revision of wages flown from Tripartite Agreement dated
         11.12.1989 and 5.6.1999 to the workman of the petitioner industry.
         2.       The reference made to the Labour Court is as follows:
                     “Whether the action of the management of Orissa Air Products
                 Ltd, Gundichapada, Dhenkanal in not extending the benefits, arising
                 out of wage revision vide tripartite settlements dated 11.12.1989
                 and 5.6.1993 to Sri Manoj Kumar Panda, Ex-Asst. Depot
                 Superintendent, is justified or not? If not, what relief he is entitled
                 to?”
        3.        The opposite party no.3-workman joined the petitioner-organisation
         on 30th December, 1985 as Clerk-cum-Typist on a consolidated pay of

                                    2
Rs.450/- per month. While continuing as such, he was a Member of the
Trade Union, namely, Orissa Air Products Employees Union.           On 26 th
March, 1989, the management offered promotion to him subject to
acceptance of terms and conditions as stipulated therein, but the same
was not been accepted by the workman.            As such, he forgone the
promotion. Accordingly, the management deducted the allowance and paid
the basic pay to him with effect from March, 1989. The Union submitted a
charter of demand on 28th June, 1989. Thereafter, the management issued
a letter on 5th December, 1989 disengaging the opposite party no.3 from
the post of Assistant Depot Superintendent and only authorized him to sign
all letters and correspondences etc. Thereafter on 11th December,1989 a
settlement was made between the workman and the management and the
workman was transferred to Balasore with the aforesaid designation i.e
Assistant Depot Superintendent. Again he was transferred to Rourkela on
21st January, 1993. In the year 1993-1994 the opposite party no.3 was
elected as the Vice President of the Union to which the management raised
a dispute that since he was working as Assistant Depot Superintendent, he
did not come within the definition of workman. Therefore, he could not have
been elected as the Vice President of the Union. The Labour Officer,
Dhenkanal considered the objection and held that the opposite party o.3 is
a workman as he was only carrying out the instructions of the superiors and
neither he had power to take decision on policy matter nor his function was
of managerial nature. However, the management disputed the same.
Accordingly, the matter was referred to the Labour Court.       Taking into
consideration the nature of work and the materials available on record, the
Labour Court came to the finding that there was no record to show that the
workman was promoted or placed in any higher grade after his
appointment as Clerk-cum-Typist.         Simple change of designation or
shouldering higher responsibility without any pecuniary benefit or having
real control over subordinates, cannot be treated as promotion. Although
the     management     designated    the   workman   as   Assistant   Depot

                                        3
Superintendent, that by itself cannot treat the workman a supervisory staff
or to hold a promotional post. In the absence of acceptance of any such
offer by the workman it cannot be said to be acceptable. In view of above
finding the learned Labour Court has passed the award holding that the
workman is entitled to get benefit of those two settlements and directed the
management to implement the award within 30 days.
4.        Earlier the petitioner-management filed W.P.(C). No.6179 of 2007
and this Court disposed of the said writ petition on 26 th March, 2013 with
an observation that the workman was not holding any supervisory post
and as such he was a workman as per the definition of the Industrial
Disputes Act.
5.         In view of the finding of the Labour Court that the opposite party
no.3 is only a workman and not holding any managerial post, there is no
error of law apparent on the face of record. Accordingly, this Court is not
inclined to interfere with the said finding so also the findings arrived at by
this Court in W.P.(C) No.6179 of 2007 disposed of on 26th March, 2013 in
which it was held that the opposite party no.3 is a workman.
          In the result, the writ petition stands dismissed. No costs.
                                                     ……………………
