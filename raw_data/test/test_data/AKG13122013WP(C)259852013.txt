                Present :     Mr. Rakesh Sahu, Advocate for the petitioner.
                              None for opposite parties.
 02. 13.12.2013          This petition seeks direction against initiation of
                coercive measures by the Bank for recovery of loan under
                the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
                         Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
                petitioner is willing to repay the loan subject to decision of
                its application to the bank for grant of time and extending
                benefit   under     the  One  Time    Settlement   Scheme,   if
                applicable.      Learned counsel further states that the
                petitioner is willing to pay a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- (rupees
                one lakh & fifty thousand) within two months from today
                along with the proposal for repayment for consideration of
                the Bank.
                         Without expressing any opinion on merits, we direct
                that if the petitioner makes deposit as aforesaid and files an
                application for consideration of the bank, the Bank may
                take decision thereon in accordance with law within one
                month from the date of such proposal and till decision is
                taken, the Bank may not take coercive measures.
                         The petition is disposed of accordingly.
                         It is made clear that if the petitioner defaults in
                making the deposit, this petition will be treated to have been
                dismissed.     It is further made clear that if the Bank is
                aggrieved by this order, it will be at liberty to move this
                Court.
                                                            ……......………………
