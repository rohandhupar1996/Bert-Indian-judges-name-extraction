Date of hearing
Date of Judgment               : 01.09.2015
                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER(ORAL)
                 This appeal under Section 30 of the Workmen’s Compensation
       Act, 1923 is preferred by United India Insurance Company Ltd.
       challenging   the Judgment and award dated 21.6.2003 passed by the
       W.C.Commissioner, Kamrup, Guwahati in W.C Case No.82 of 2002.
       2.     By that judgment and award, the W.C. Commissioner, directed the
       insurance company to make payment of Rs.1,45,195/- to the claimant
       within 30 days from the date of order failing which interest @ 9 % per
       annum of the awarded amount has been directed.
       3.       Dimbeswar Das as claimant approached the W.C.Commissioner,
       Guwahati at Ulubari stating that he was employed as conductor in vehicle
       No. AMK-8456 owned by Sabitri Bala Das. On 19.10.2001 , while he was
       driving vehicle from Mandia towards Barpeta , it met with an accident at
       about 3.30 pm on being hit by another bus from the backside. As a result
       of the accident, he fell down on the front portion of the bus and sustained
       fracture injury on his left hand. He also sustained serious injury on his
MFA No.127 of 2004                                           Page 2 of 7

      head, chest and left thigh apart from injuries on various other parts of the
      body. He was immediately taken to Barpeta Civil Hospital. X-Ray
      examination was held . It was found that he had suffered fracture to left
      radius bone and had to undergo treatment for long time. Because of the
      accident, he cannot do work with his left hand and is unable to discharge
      duties as conductor of any bus. The owner of the vehicle did not make
      payment of any compensation to him and so he made a prayer for
      appropriate compensation.
      4.        The owner opposite party No.1 appeared and submitted written
      statement admitting employment of the claimant as conductor of the
      vehicle. The owner also admitted that there was an accident on
      19.10.2001. The owner also admitted that the claimant was being paid
      Rs.4200/- towards monthly salary. The opposite party No.2 filed written
      statement denying the case of the claimant and prayed that claimant’s
      case be dismissed.
      5.        Claimant examined himself as PW-1 and adduced Exhibits- 1 and
      2 prescription. Exhibit-3 is the X-Ray report and Exhibit-4 is the medical
      certificate. Police report was exhibited as Exhibit-5 whereas Exhibit-6 is
      the policy document. PW-1 proved conductor license as Exhibit-7.
      According to him, he was 33 years of age at the time of the accident and
MFA No.127 of 2004                                          Page 3 of 7

      that he was drawing Rs.4200/- as monthly salary. This witness was duly
      cross examined by the insurance company when he stated that he used
      to get Rs.600/- as monthly salary and Rs.120/- as daily allowance.
      6.        The claimant examined Dr. SC Sharma as PW-2 who stated that
      on 19.10.2001 he had examined the claimant and found three injuries on
      his persons . Injury -1 is a contusion on left forehead, injury No.2 is
      contusion in the right parietal and Injury-3 is a contusion on the right
      thigh. According to him, injury No.1 is grievous resulting in 40% physical
      disability. Because of the disability , the claimant had lost earning capacity
      to the tune of 30%. The doctor was cross examined at length but no fatal
      contradiction could be elicited from his mouth.
      7.           Considering the evidence on record, the W.C. Commissioner
      arrived at the finding that the claimant was engaged as conductor in the
      vehicle involved in the accident and that the vehicle was covered by valid
      insurance of the opposite party No.2. It is the finding of the W.C.
      Commissioner that the workman was being paid Rs.4200/- as monthly
      salary and that he lost earning capacity to the tune of 30%. Accepting his
      age to be 32 years, the W.C. Commissioner made assessment of
      compensation as follows:-
MFA No.127 of 2004                                            Page 4 of 7

      60% of Rs.4000/- x 201.66 x 30%= Rs.1,45,195.20 which is rounded off
      to Rs.1,45,195.00.
      8.            W.C.Commissioner directed the insurance company to make
      deposit of the amount within a period of 30 days failing which interest @
      9 % per annum has been imposed. This judgment and award passed on
      21.6.2003 has been brought under challenged under section of 30 of the
      W.C.Act., 1923.
      9.             This court while admitting this appeal on 26.2.2007 framed
      the following substantial question of law:-
                                 “Whether the purpose of Section 146(1) as
              policy shall not be required to cover liability in respect of the death
              arising out of and in course of employment of an in course of
              employment of the person insured unless; first; the liability of the
              insured arises under the W.C. Act, 1923 and second if the
              employee is engaged in driving the vehicle?”
      10.          I have heard Mr. A Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant.
      None appears for the respondent.
MFA No.127 of 2004                                             Page 5 of 7

      11.          Mr. A Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant submits that
      claimant was a conductor of the bus and as such,         he is statutorily
      covered under proviso to Section 147 of the M.V. Act, 1988. Even in the
      case of R am ashray Singh –vs- New India Assurance Com pany Ltd .
      reported in (AIR 2003 SC 2877)          the Hon’ble Supreme Court has
      considered the provision of Section 147 of the M.V.Act in para-8 of the
      judgment. Statutory cover of the conductor and the driver of a public
      vehicle has been considered in the aforesaid paragraph of the reported
      judgment. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed that if the insured
      pays for insurance cover of any other person and the insurer agrees to it ,
      in that event such employee also would be covered by the insurance
      cover. Mr. Sharma has fairly placed on record a copy of the insurance
      policy in the present case which shows that insured paid Rs.30/- towards
      insurance premium for the driver and /or conductor and this being the
      position, under the policy in question, there was insurance cover over of
      the conductor. This being the position, the sole substantial question of
      law framed in this case is to be answered against the appellant and in
      favour of the claimant holding that the claimant conductor was covered
      by insurance policy. The learned W.C.Commissioner has not committed
      any error in passing the impugned judgment and award and thus, the
      appeal does not have any merit. Accordingly, it is dismissed. No order as
      to cost.

         12.           Stay order passed earlier stands vacated. If the amount has
         not been disbursed to the workman, the same shall be disbursed to him
         subject to proper identification.
         13.          Send down the records.
