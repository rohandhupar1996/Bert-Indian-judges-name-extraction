C.R. Dash, J.                    This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of
           sentence dated 21.12.2001 passed by learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Angul
           in Sessions Trial No.111-A of 1997 / 64 of 1997, convicting the appellants
           under Sections 302/201, I.P.C. and sentencing each of them to suffer
           imprisonment for life thereunder.

                                      2
2.             The occurrence happened on 05.06.1997 on the day of “Savitri
Amavasya” at village Kathapal under Chhendipada P.S. in the district of
Angul. Two innocent children namely Bapi and Muni are alleged to have
suffered death in the hands of the present appellants. Informant Basant
Kumar Panigrahi (P.W.3) is the paternal uncle of the deceased children. The
prosecution case, as found from record, is that on the date of occurrence the
bodies of deceased Bapi and Muni were recovered from a well situated at a
distance of about 150 meters from their house. The Medical Officer of the
Additional Primary Health Centre, Bagedia declared them brought dead. In
the afternoon before dusk, the deceased children were found watching the
appellants catching squirrels. One of the appellants namely Birabar Nayak
(appellant no.6) being known to the informant (P.W.3), he (informant) did not
object the children to be present near the appellants. When the children did
not return home, the family members searched for them. Mother of the
informant (P.W.3) asked the appellants regarding the whereabouts of the
children in course of such search, and the appellants gave out that the
children had already returned home since long. When the children were not
found, their family members asked the appellants to search for them in the
nearby well suspecting that they might have fallen into the well. None of the
appellants however agreed to search for the children inside the well. One
Panchanan Majhi (P.W.15) ultimately entered into the well and brought out
the bodies of the deceased children. Some injuries on the bodies of both the
children were found. The well was full with 10 feets’ deep water. The bodies
of the children were immediately rushed to Bagedia A.P.H.C., where the
Medical Officer declared them brought dead. On the basis of the information
lodged by P.W.3, investigation was taken up by the Police and on completion
of investigation, the I.O. (P.W.19) submitted charge-sheet against all the

                                      3
appellants implicating them in the offence punishable under Sections
302/201/34, I.P.C.
3.             Altogether 19 witnesses were examined by the prosecution to
prove the charge, out of whom P.Ws.3 to 5, P.Ws.9, 12 and 13 are the
witnesses, who have testified about the fact that the deceased children had
gone with the appellants while they (appellants) were hunting squirrels and
further they are asserted to have proved the fact that the appellants were
found near the well wherefrom the dead bodies of the deceased children were
recovered. The aforesaid witnesses have further testified that when the
appellants were questioned regarding the whereabouts of the missing
children, they told that they have already gone to their house and the
appellants also refused to search for the children by entering into the well.
P.Ws.7 and 8 are the witnesses to the confessional statement of appellant
Nada Penthoi and recovery of a knife (M.O.-I) at his instance. P.W.14 is a
witness, who has testified the fact that he saw the children going near the
appellants and sometimes thereafter he (P.W.14) heard about missing of the
children. P.W.15 is the person, who entered inside the well to bring out the
deceased children. P.W.17 is the witness to the seizure of Lungi (M.O.-II) of
appellant Nada Penthoi, which was found to be stained with blood. P.W.11 is
the Medical Officer, who conducted post-mortem over the dead bodies of the
deceased children and P.W.19 is the I.O.
               Defence has examined none on its behalf, though the defence
plea is one of complete denial.

                                          4
4.             The case is based entirely on circumstantial evidence. Learned
Trial Court taking into consideration the materials on record, found the
appellants guilty of the charges and sentenced them accordingly.
5.             Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the prosecution
has failed to prove the circumstances incriminatory against the appellants and
learned Trial Court has failed to apply judicial mind in drawing inference of
guilt of the appellants from the circumstances alleged to have been proved.
               Learned Additional Standing Counsel on the other hand
supports the impugned judgment and order of sentence.
6.             The circumstances, on which reliance is placed, are – (i) The
deceased children were seen last together in the company of the appellants;
(ii) both the children were playing near the well where the appellants were
hunting for squirrels; (iii) none of the appellants agreed to enter inside the well
for search of the missing children, though requested; (iv) recovery of the knife
(M.O.I) at the instance of appellant Nada Penthoi and presence of human
blood on that knife as found from chemical and serological examination
report; and (v) presence of blood also on appellant Nada Penthoi’s ‘Check
Lungi’ (M.O.-II), which was seized by the police on production by him.
7.             From the chemical and serological examination report, we find
that though human blood was found on the ‘Lungi’ (M.O.-II) seized on
production by appellant Nada Penthoi, but no opinion could be given about its
group. Similarly, no opinion on the blood present on the knife (M.O.-I) could
be given regarding its origin or group. In view of such fact, no conclusive
opinion could be given by the Analysts regarding presence of human blood of
group ‘O’ or ‘B’ (which are blood groups of the deceased children) either on

                                       5
the ‘Lungi’ (M.O.-II) or the knife (M.O.I).     In view of such inconclusive
evidence, it cannot be said that presence of blood on the ‘Lungi’ (M.O.II) of
appellant Nada Penthoi is incriminatory in any way or the knife (M.O.-I) was
used in causing injuries to the deceased children. Presence of blood on a
person’s wearing apparels may be for various causes, especially when such a
person earns his livelihood by engaging himself as a labourer and he is rustic.
We therefore loathe to concur with the findings of the learned Trial Court to
the effect that presence of human blood on the ‘Lungi’ (M.O.-II) seized on
production by appellant Nada Penthoi and presence of blood on the knife
(M.O.I) is one of the circumstances incriminatory against all the appellants.
8.             The evidence regarding seizure of knife (M.O.-I) from beneath
a heap of ‘Kendu’ leaves, at the instance of appellant Nada Penthoi on the
basis of his disclosure statement, is contradicted by P.W.7, who, in his
examination-in-chief has testified that the knife and chapals were seized by
the police from the spot. Contradicting such statement, again he (P.W.7) has
testified that while in custody, appellant Nada Penthoi told that the ‘Chaku’
(knife – M.O.-I) by which he killed the deceased children was concealed
under a heap of ‘Kendu’ leaves and he led the police party to give recovery of
that ‘Chaku’. In view of such prevaricating statements of the witness, who
was examined to prove the confessional statement and consequent recovery
of the weapon of offence, we do not feel persuaded to place reliance on the
evidence of recovery of the knife (M.O.-I) at the instance of appellant Nada
Penthoi.
9.             The next circumstance is to the effect that the appellants were
seen last in the company of the deceased children and they refused to enter

                                         6
inside the well for search of the missing children, though requested. The
cause of death of deceased Bapi is opined to be smothering and the cause of
death of deceased Muni is opined to be throttling. There are some injuries on
both the dead bodies. Admittedly, both the deceased children were playing
near the well. The prosecution has designedly not proved the spot map and
the defence counsel has not cross-examined the I.O. regarding the situation
of the spot well. On verification of the record, it is fairly submitted by learned
Additional Standing Counsel that the I.O., on his spot visit, has prepared the
spot map and in the spot visit report he has specifically mentioned that there
was no raised platform around the well.           As the deceased were small
children, it was not unnatural for them to fall into the well while immersed in
playing. Further the appellants having stated to be engaged in hunting
squirrels, might not have marked the children falling into the well and they on
being questioned, have answered that the children had left the place since
long. Anybody, who is not accustomed to enter inside a well may not agree
to enter inside it, even if requested, as such an act may be at his peril. In
view of such fact, we do not feel persuaded to accept refusal by the
appellants to enter inside the well on request and their answer to the effect
that the children have already left for their home since long as circumstances
incriminatory against them. In absence of diatom test, it cannot be definitely
said whether the death was due to drowning or not. Admittedly, the dead
bodies of the deceased children were recovered from the well and the only
circumstance against the appellants is to the effect that they were seen last in
the company of the deceased children.                In absence of any other
circumstances, it is difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion that it was the
appellants, who have killed the deceased children.

                                       7
10.            In view of the above, we set aside the impugned judgment of
conviction and order of sentence passed by the learned Trial Court. The
appellants are acquitted of the charges. The appellants, who are stated to be
on bail, be discharged of the bail bonds.
               The Jail Criminal Appeal is accordingly allowed.
