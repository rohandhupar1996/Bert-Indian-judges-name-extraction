                 pay in terms of the appointment order(s). But as their salary payment was
                 stopped after a while, they filed the present case for disbursal of their current
                 and arrear salary from June 2006.
                 4.       Mr. H.K. Sarma, the learned Counsel submits that after the writ petition
                 was filed, the teachers were paid their salary uptil February 2012 but since then
                 their wages have remained unpaid.
                 5.       In his turn, Mr. N.J. Khataniar, the learned Standing Counsel for the
                 Department of Elementary Education submits that an Expert Committee was
                 constituted by the Government, in pursuant to the High Court’s direction in
                 Sudhendu Mohan Talukdar vs. State of Assam reported in 2006 (2) GLT 216 and
                 he submits that the salary grievances of the petitioners can be addressed
                 appropriately, by this Expert Committee.
                   6.     For a similar group of L.P. School Teachers, direction was issued on
                 18.2.2013 in the W.A. 336/2007 (Jyoti Prasad Bor Baruah vs. State of Assam)
                 where the Division Bench directed the Commissioner and Secretary to the
                 Government of Assam, Department of Elementary Education, who is the
                 Chairman of the Expert Committee, to take a final decision on the salary
                 grievances raised by the L.P. School Teachers. It further appears that the
                 petitioners had appeared before the concerned Committee on 11.3.2013 but Mr.
                 Sarma submits that final decision is still to be taken by the Expert Committee.
                 7.       In the above circumstances, having regard to the fact that the petitioners
                 were heard by the Expert Committee, a final decision should be taken in the
                 matter. Hence the Committee should pass individual speaking order(s) for the
                 petitioner(s) within 3 months of receipt of this order. If aggrieved by the
                 Committee’s decision, the petitioners can apply for redressal in accordance with
                 law. It is ordered accordingly.
                 8.       With the above order, this case is disposed of without any order on cost.
                                                                                             JUDGE
