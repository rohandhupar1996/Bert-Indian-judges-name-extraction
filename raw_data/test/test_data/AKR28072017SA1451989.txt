      PRESENT:
                   THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
      Date of Hearing: 21.7.2017         &          Date of Judgment: 28.7.2017
Dr.A.K.RATH, J.      This is a defendant’s appeal against an affirming
      judgment.
      2.           Respondent as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No.30 of
      1981 in the court of the learned Munsif, Bhanjanagar impleading the
      appellant as defendant no.1 for partition of suit schedule properties.
      The case of the plaintiff is that he and defendant no.1 are the sons of
      late Agadhu Gouda. Defendant no.2 is their mother. The suit
      schedule lands are the ancestral properties of the plaintiff and

                                    2
defendant. The plaintiff is in possession of the same. The defendant
no.1 was working in a Colliery at West Bengal. He came back in the
year 1981 and threatened to dispossess the plaintiff from the suit
properties. Thereafter the plaintiff requested him for partition of the
suit properties, but he maintained a stony like silence.
3.           Defendant no.1 entered appearance and filed written
statement stating therein that the suit lands are their ancestral
properties. The specific case of defendant no.1 is that the plaintiff
had been adopted by one Chaitanya Gouda. The plaintiff is staying
with his adoptive father from his childhood. He denied the
possession of the plaintiff over the suit lands.
4.           On the inter se pleadings of the parties, the learned trial
court framed six issues. Both the parties led evidence, both oral and
documentary, in support of their cases. On a threadbare analysis of
the evidence on record as well as pleadings, the learned trial court
disbelieved the case of the defendant that the plaintiff was the
adopted son of Chaitanya Gouda. It further held that the suit
schedule lands are the ancestral properties of the parties and
decreed the suit. The defendant no.1 unsuccessfully challenged the
said judgment and decree before the learned Subordinate Judge,
Bhanjanagar in Title Appeal No.2 of 1986, which was eventually
dismissed.
5.           The Second Appeal was admitted on 24.4.2001 on the
following substantial questions of law:-
             “(i)  Whether in view of settled legal position that
                   in case of adoption long time back, validity of
                   adoption can be presumed especially when in
                   the instant case adoption was made more
                   than 30 years prior to institution of suit.

                                    3
             (ii)   Whether in view of well settled principle that
                    since the plea of non-joinder of necessary
                    party touches the root of the case as to its
                    maintainability, can be raised at any stage,
                    and whether the finding of the learned lower
                    appellate court that such plea is not
                    entertainable at appellate stage is legal and
                    sustainable.”
6.           Heard Mr.P.K.Das, learned Advocate for the appellant.
None appeared for the respondent.
7.           Mr.Das, learned Advocate for the appellant submitted
that the plaintiff is the adopted son of Chaitanya Gouda. The courts
below have committed a manifest illegality and impropriety in not
considering the voter lists, vide Exts. E, F and G. He further
contended that even in absence of giving and taking ceremony
adoption can be held to be proved, if it is ancient and the alleged
adopted son was treated by the adoptive father and other relations as
son of the adoptive father.
8.           In the case of Kishori Lal Vrs. Mt. Chaltibai, A.I.R. 1959
SC 504, the apex Court held that as an adoption results in changing
the course of succession, depriving wives and daughters of their
rights and transferring properties to comparative strangers or more
remote relations it is necessary that the evidence to support it should
be such that it is free from all suspicion of fraud and so consistent
and probable as to leave no occasion for doubting its truth.
9.           The apex Court in the case of Lakshman Singh Kothari
Vrs. Smt. Rup Kanwar, A.I.R. 1961 S.C.1378 held that under the
Hindu Law, whether among the regenerate caste or among Sudras,
there cannot be a valid adoption unless the adoptive boy is
transferred from one family to another and that can be done only by

                                     4
the ceremony of giving and taking. The object of the corporeal giving
and receiving in adoption is obviously to secure due publicity. To
achieve this object it is essential to have a formal ceremony. No
particular form is prescribed for the ceremony, but the law requires
that the natural parent shall band over the adoptive boy and the
adoptive parent shall receive him. The nature of the ceremony may
vary depending upon the circumstances of each case. But a
ceremony there shall be, and giving and taking shall be part of it.
The exigencies of the situation arising out of diverse circumstances
necessitated the introduction of the doctrine of delegation; and,
therefore, the parents, after exercising their volition to give and take
the boy in adoption, may both or either of them delegate the physical
act of handing over the boy or receiving him, as the case may be, to a
third party.
10.           The burden of establishing that there was a valid
adoption which deflected the ordinary course of succession is on the
party who pleads the case of adoption as held by this Court in the
case of Krushna Chandra Sahu and another Vrs. Pradipta Das and
others, 53 (1982) C.L.T. 335.
11.           This Court in the case of Bauri Dei and others Vrs.
Dasarathi Sahu and others, 41 (1975) C.L.T.267 held that creation of
documents is no substitute for the fact of giving and taking which
must be proved independently de hors any document.
12.           The pleading lacks material facts of giving and taking
ceremony except bald assertion that the plaintiff was adopted by one
Chaitanya Gouda. No evidence was adduced by the defendant that
there was giving and taking ceremony at the time of adoption of the
plaintiff. The voter lists have been marked as exhibits. The same is no

                                   5
substitute for the fact of giving and taking. On an anatomy of the
pleadings and evidence, both the courts have negatived the plea of
adoption. There is no perversity or illegality in the findings of the
courts below. Accordingly, the substantial question of law no.1 is
answered. With regard to substantial question no.2, since no plea
was taken and no evidence was adduced by the defendant, this Court
did not delve into the same.
13.           In the ultimate analysis, the appeal fails and is
dismissed. No costs.
                                             ………....…………………..
