PRESENT:
               THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE D.DASH
      Date of hearing- 08.12.2015       : Date of judgment- 14.12.2015
             The appellants in this appeal have called in question the
judgment and decree passed by the learned Additional District Judge,

                                       2
Jajpur in Title Appeal No.15/43 of 1986-87. The appellants as the
plaintiffs had filed Title Suit No.116 of 1981, a suit for declaration of
their right, title and interest over the land described in schedule ‘A’ of
the plaint along with the sketch map provided in schedule ‘B’ for
confirmation of possession and demarcation against the respondents
arraigning them as the defendants. The suit having been decreed, the
original respondent no.1 being the aggrieved defendant no.1 had filed
the appeal under section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appeal
has been allowed and the present appellants ( plaintiffs) have thus been
non-suited. It may be mentioned here that during pendency of this
appeal, the appellant no.1, who was the plaintiff no.2 in the trial court
and respondent no.2 in the lower appellate court has died and her name
has accordingly been expunged as dead. Similar is the situation with
respect to the respondent nos.2 to 7 who were the defendant nos. 2 to 7
in the trial court and respondent nos.4 to 9 in the lower appellate court.
              It may be stated here that in this appeal appellants
contended that the defendant no.2 having died during pendency of the
appeal before the lower appellate court, the said appeal thus stood
abated and the judgment and decree passed therein are nullities. This
has been one of the substantial questions of law.

                                       3
2.           For the sake of convenience, in order to bring in clarity and
avoid confusion, the parties hereinafter have been referred to as they
have been arraigned in the trial court.
3.           Plaintiffs case is that the suit land stood recorded in the
name of Ujal Paramanik, Ballava Paramanik and Bainshi Paramanik the
three sons of Rama Paramanik in the records of the current settlement.
It is stated that way back in the year 1930, there was a partition
between them in respect of their joint family properties where each had
been allotted with five annas, four pahis of share. In schedule ‘B’ of the
plaint, the allotment has been described by giving a sketch map. The
pedigree is stated as under:
                                 Ram Paramanik
                                      /
                /                         /                                /
            Ujal                      Ballav                  Bansi (late)
                                                         W=Chanci Bewa
             /
______________________________          /
/            /            /
Gundi      Pusi      Late Daitari     Radhu
                    W=Kunti
                          /
           _____________________________
            /             /             /
          Panchu Chandramani             Arjun

                                       4
             It is stated that Ujal had three sons, namely, Gundi, Puri
and Daitari. Daitari died leaving behind his widow Kunti and three sons,
namely, Panchu, Chandramani and Arjuna. Ballava died leaving his
only son Radhu and Bansi was survived by his widow Chhanchi.
Plaintiffs further state that after the said partition in the year 1930,
members of each branch were in possession of separate parcels of the
land which they got in partition. Accordingly, the heirs of Ujal, namely,
Gundi, Puri, Kunti and       Chandramani and Arjuna and Panchu who
were then minors through his mother guardian Kunti sold Ac.0.06 dec.
of land to the father of the plaintiff no.1, namely, Mani Rout and the
father of plaintiff no.2 namely, Rama Rout by registered sale deed dated
27.03.1953. It is also stated that Chanci Bewa the widow of Bansi had
also sold Ac.0.06 dec. in her possession as of the share of the Bansi to
the above by registered sale deed dated 29.10.1953. They had delivered
possession of the land sold to those Vendees. Plaintiff nos.1 and 2 are
the sons of Rama whereas the plaintiff no.2 is the wife of Mani, who
have succeeded to the properties purchased by Mani and Rama and are
in possession. It is their case that the defendants have their land under
plot no.2496 adjacent to West of the suit land. They also claimed to
have purchased the said land from one Ballav Paramanik. The plaintiffs

                                        5
alleged that on 06.05.1981, the defendants disturbed the plaintiffs’
possession over the suit land and also threatened them to create further
troubles in future in their possession and then after some days they
placed a palm leaf thatched shed over a portion of the suit land forcibly.
             The defendant no.1 contested the suit by filing written
statement. While traversing the plaint averments, it is stated that the
suit land was never in possession of Ujal or his heirs and rather it was
in possession of Ballav. It is stated that parties were in separate
possession in respect of the land under suit plot no.2495 amicably and
it was having a projected portion towards the north-western side and
that portion was in possession of Ballav and was never possessed by
Ujal or his heirs. It is further stated that in the north-western projected
portion of the land, Ballav had two kachha houses and Radhu, the son
of Ballav possessed the said land after his father. Having 1/3rd interest
over the disputed land he transferred said possessed land at two places
to defendant no.1 by registered sale deed dated 25.07.1961. Thus, the
defendant no.1 claims to have been in possession of the said land since
25.07.1961. It is also his case that there is a demarcating ridge in
between the possessed land of Radhu now in his possession and the
rest of the portion of the suit land which the plaintiffs now want

                                       6
obstruct. He further asserts that his purchased house exists on a
portion of the suit land and the north-western projected portion has
been amalgamated by him with his own land under plot no.2496 lying
to the west-southern side of that projected plot. With all these,
defendant no.1 prays to non-suit the plaintiff.
4.           The trial court on such rival pleadings framed altogether six
issues. Having taken up issue no.2 for decision that if there was any
partition between Ujal, Ballav and Bansi and whether the suit land fell
to the share of Bansi and Ujal separately in their five annas and four
pahis of share each, answer has been rendered on examination of
evidence and their assessment in affirmative in favour of the plaintiffs.
Within the above the other issue as regards the transfer of the suit land
by successors of Ujal and Banshi’s widow in favour of Mani and Rama
have also been answered running in favour of the plaintiffs. The claim of
the defendant no.1 as regards of acquisition of title by adverse
possession has been negatived and the possession of the plaintiffs over
the suit land have been found out. In view of the above, the suit has
been decreed declaring plaintiffs right, title and interest, confirming
their possession as also for demarcation.

                                        7
5.            In the appeal, the lower appellate court affirmed the finding
of the trial court concerning partition of the properties between the Ujal,
Ballav and Bansi in metes and bounds. However, going to the next point
on the question of possession of the plaintiffs as claimed and that of the
defendant no.1 as asserted, the followings are the discussions and
conclusion:
                    “Though there is no evidence of adverse
           possession of the suit land by the defendant no.1, yet the
           evidence led on his side clearly shows that he purchased
           the suit north-west projected area of the suit plot
           abutting to his own plot no.2496 and road on the north,
           and it appears to be more probable than the evidence led
           on the side of the plaintiffs. I, therefore, in disagreement
           with the finding of the lower court hold that the
           defendant no.1 has been in possession of the suit land
           abutting the public road in the north and his own plot in
           the west, in his own right after purchase of the same
           from Radhu Paramanik in 1959, under Ext.D. That being
           so, the plaintiffs are not entitled to the declaration or
           recovery of possession of the suit land as prayed for.”
6.            The appeal has been admitted on the following substantial
questions of law:
                     “(i) Whether the title appeal has abated in its
               entirety on account of non-substitution of the legal
               representatives of defendant no.2, who died in the
               lower appellate court?
                     (ii) Whether the judgment of the lower
               appellate court is vitiated on account of non-
               consideration of the admissions of the defendants
               and their predecessors in the various sale deeds and

                                      8
             the depositions which are the basis of title of the
             plaintiffs?”
            It is pertinent to state that upon hearing the parties, this
Court by detail order dated 04.11.2015 has already answered the first
substantial question of law as it was at that time felt necessary since
the answer to it in affirmative would have caused non-survival of the
second substantial question of law for its answer.
            The answer to the first question has been rendered as
under:
            “The appeal before the lower appellate court taking into
consideration aforesaid non-substitution would neither have caused the
appeal to abate as a whole nor it can be said that the lower appellate
court was not within the legal competence to pass the judgment and
decree in dismissing the suit filed by the present appellant and others
which was assailed by t he surviving defendants before the said court.”
            Thus in the present appeal, there remains the second
substantial question of law for being answered.
7.          Learned counsel for the appellant submits that in view of
the concurrent finding of fact as regards the partition as also the finding
that the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs are the purchasers of
the land from the successors of Ujal and widow of Bansi, namely,

                                      9
Chanci, by registered sale deed necessary conclusion stands that the
possession of the purchased properties covered under the respective
sale deeds had been delivered to them and when there remains
overwhelming oral evidence on record with respect to their possession,
the lower appellate court has committed serious error in declining to
grant the reliefs as prayed for by the    plaintiffs in finally non-suiting
them.. Furthermore, in support of the same, he contends that the
judgment of the lower appellate court is vitiated for non-consideration of
the admission of the defendant no.1 and also their predecessors in
various sale deeds besides the evidence of other witnesses.
             Learned counsel for the respondent submits in favour of the
findings of the lower appellate court which have led for dismissal of the
suit. He has placed the evidence on record in arguing that the lower
appellate court having in fact found the possession of the suit land with
the defendant no.1 did commit no mistake. This according to him is
based on a detail discussion of evidence on record as also the
descriptions of the purchased land in various sale deeds.
8.           In order to answer the substantial question of law by
addressing the rival submission, it has to be kept in mind that the lower
appellate court has wholly concurred with the finding of the trial court

                                       10
that the three branches of Ujal, Ballav and Bansi had partitioned the
properties in metes and bounds and it was not simply a severance of
status and amicable arrangement in respect of possession for
convenience.
             The sale deeds standing in favour of the predecessor-in-
interest of the plaintiffs vide Exts.1 and 2 have been held to be valid.
Those contain the recitals as regards the delivery of possession of the
suit land to the vendees, i.e., the predecessors-in-interest of the
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have led oral evidence on that score of
possession since purchase. The defendant no.1 having claimed
acquisition of title by adverse possession over a portion of the suit land
has failed in establishing the same. It is also not his case that he ever
dispossessed the plaintiffs or their predecessors-in-interest and rather
has deposed in clear and categorical terms which for better appreciation
may be quoted hereunder:
             “I had also seen the three branches of Paramanik family
possessing their respective homestead and other lands separately. They
had also separate houses in the suit plot. They were possessing the
same separately.
       xxx                xxx               xxx                xxx

                                        11
             The plaintiff is in possession of the land after the purchase,
which was under the possession of Ujalla. The plaintiff is also
possessing the land of Bansi after its purchase which was under the
possession of Bansi after the suit”
9.           Similarly, D.W.2’s evidence remains the following:
             “The three branches of Paramanik family were possessing
their homestead and other lands separately. Ballav Paramanik was in
possession of north-west projected area of the suit plot. Thereafter, his
son Radhu was possessing it. They had their residential there. Radhu
had two separate houses in that projected area.
Xxx                 xxx                xxx                xxx
             Bansi Paramanik was in possession of the land situating to
the east of the projecting area. He had a house there.
Xxx          xxx                 xxx                      xxx
             Plaintiffs are possessing the land of Bansi and Ujal”.
Xxx          xxx                 xxx                      xxx
             But they were possessing the land in different places, as per
the existence of their respective houses.
             The above evidence clearly show that the members of
Paramanik family not only had partitioned their properties including

                                      12
their homestead which includes the disputed plots since long. So, the
predecessors-in-interest of the plaintiffs having purchased specific
parcels of the land which had been allotted to their respective vendors
in respect of the suit plot no.2495 by virtue of registered sale deeds
Exts.1 and 2 followed by delivery of possession and to have maintained
the possession as such till the date of the suit, when there remains no
allegation of dispossession by defendant no.1 and more particularly
when the claim of acquisition of title by adverse possession by
defendant no.1 over any portion of the suit land has remained
unestablished, there was absolutely no justification on the part of the
lower appellate court to hold that since the defendant no.1 had
purchased the north-west projected area of the suit plot appertaining
his own plot and road on the north that too by a sale deed of much later
date about a decade after, he is to be held to be in possession of the suit
land on his own right on the basis of the purchase of the same from
Radhu vide Ext.D. The approach is seen to be wholly erroneous and as
such the conclusion is unsustainable in the eye of law. The aforesaid
discussions and reason while      providing fitting answer to the second
substantial question of law lead this Court to hold that the judgment

                                         13
and decree passed by the lower appellate court is thus liable to be set
aside.
10.            In the result, the appeal stands allowed. The judgment and
decree passed by the trial court is restored to hold the field and those of
the lower appellate court are hereby set aside.
               In the facts and circumstances, there would, however, be no
order as to cost.
