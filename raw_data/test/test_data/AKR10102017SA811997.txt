                               JUDGMENT
    PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
                   Date of Hearing & Judgment:10.10.2017
Dr.A.K.RATH, J. This is a plaintiff’s appeal against reversing judgment
    in a suit for declaration of right, title, interest and permanent
    injunction.
    2.           The case of the plaintiff is that the suit land originally
    belongs to one Chandnama Devi, mother of defendant no.3. After her

                                    2
death, her son, defendant no.3 succeeded to the property. To meet
his legal necessities, defendant no.3 sold the suit land along with
other lands to one defendant no.4 in the year 1969 and received
valid consideration. Possession was duly delivered to the vendee. The
defendant no.4 was in possession of the land. At the time of
alienation, the defendant no.3 was residing at Bhubaneswar. He
could not execute the sale deed in favour of defendant no.4. On
8.5.1980 he executed a registered sale deed in favour of defendant
no.4. In the year 1984 defendant no.4 sold the suit land to the
plaintiff by means of a registered sale deed no.897 dated 14.5.1984
for a valid consideration and delivered possession to him. Since then
the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land and paying rent to the
defendants. Thereafter the plaintiff applied for mutation before the
Tahasildar, Hindol-defendant no.2. But then the Tahasildar refused
to mutate the said case on the ground that the suit land was
included in the ceiling proceeding initiated against defendant no.3
under the O.L.R. Act, which was sub-judice. The R.I. threatened the
plaintiff to dispossess, whereafter he instituted the suit seeking the
relief mentioned supra.
3.            The defendants 1 and 2 filed written statement denying
the assertions made in the plaint. The case of the defendants is that
a ceiling proceeding was initiated against defendant no.3. The suit
schedule land was the subject matter of dispute in the ceiling
surplus proceeding. The case was sub-judice. Thus, execution of sale
deed was invalid and inoperative.
4.            The defendants were subsequently set ex parte. The
learned trial court decreed the suit. The defendants appealed before
the learned District Judge, Dhenkanal, which was subsequently

                                      3
transferred to the court of the learned Additional Civil Judge (Senior
Division), Dhenkanal and renumbered as Title Appeal No.12 of 1991
/8 of 1995. The same was allowed.
5.            The Second Appeal was admitted on the following
substantial questions of law enumerated in ground nos.(1), (2), (3),
(4) & (5) of the appeal memo. The same are:-
              “(1) Whether the appellate court is correct and justified
              in setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial
              court     in view of specific finding that delivery of
              possession of suit land was given upon transfer of land
              in question by proforma defendant no.3 in favour of
              Jatak Dei, vendor of plaintiff, in 1989, there is passing of
              sale consideration prior to O.L.R. Act coming into force
              and finding that Jatak Dei had acquired, right, title,
              interest and possession over the suit land from 1969 till
              1984 when she sold under Ext.2 in favour of plaintiff
              and that thereafter plaintiff has acquired right, title,
              interest and possession over the suit land by paying rent
              to State under Exts.3 to 3/4 from the date of her
              purchase ? Is the appellate court justified in refusing
              title and possession of plaintiff as well as of her vendor
              since 1989 in absence of any material/evidence
              controverting/rebutting the evidence of plaintiff to that
              effect ?
              (2) Whether the finding of declaring Exts.1 and 2 as void
              i.e. the registered sale deeds, is correct, in view of recital
              of the sale deeds and other contemporious documents,
              which were duly proved and were found to be genuine
              corroborated by ample oral evidence produced by
              plaintiff ? Is the appellate court correct in setting aside
              the same in absence of any evidence on behalf of
              defendants ?
              (3)    Whether the finding of non-abatement of appeal is
              correct particularly when legal heirs of Jatak Dei and
              Pratap Chandra Singh were not substituted in the title
              appeal and they died during pendency of appeal, the
              judgment and decree being a joint and indivisible one ?

                                    4
             (4)   Whether the finding, in consideration of Section 45
             of O.L.R. Act applies to the sale of suit land, is correct,
             particularly when on receipt of entire consideration
             money transfer was made and consideration delivery of
             possession was given in 1969 in favour of Jatak Dei by
             the proforma defendant no.3?
             (5)   Whether the findings of appellate court are
             otherwise illegal, unjust and perverse and whether the
             appellate court is justified in setting aside the judgment
             and decree of trial court arriving at a different
             conclusion than the trial court without assigning cogent
             reasons for the same in absence of any evidence on
             behalf of defendants ?”
6.           Heard Mr.Yesshan Mohanty, learned Sr. Advocate along
with   Mr.P.C.Biswal,    learned  Advocate     for  the  appellant  and
Mr.R.P.Mohapatra, learned Additional Government Advocate along
with Ms.Samapika Mishra, learned Additional Standing Counsel for
the respondents.
7.           Mr.Mohanty, learned Sr.Advocate for the appellant
argues    with   vehemence     that    the   defendants    took  several
adjournments in the suit. Sufficient opportunity was provided to
them. The defendants did not take any steps and as such they were
set ex parte. The learned trial court, on a threadbare analysis of the
evidence on record and pleadings, came to hold that the plaintiff has
right, title and interest over the suit land. On untenable and
unsupportable grounds, the learned appellate court up set the
finding of the learned trial court. The finding of the learned trial
court that the suit schedule land was included in the ceiling
proceeding is perverse inasmuch as there was no material before the
learned appellate court to come to such a finding.
8.           Conversely,     Mr.R.P.Mohapatra,      learned   Additional
Government Advocate for the respondents submits that the suit

                                    5
schedule land was the subject of matter of dispute in the ceiling
proceeding. During pendency of that proceeding, the land was
alienated by the land owner and as such alienation is bad in law.
9.            The suit was posted to 22.3.91 for hearing. The
defendants filed an application for adjournment. The same was
rejected. The matter was taken up thereafter. Three witnesses were
examined by the plaintiff. The judgment was delivered on 25.3.1991.
No opportunity was provided to the defendants to cross-examine the
witnesses. Further, though a plea was taken by the defendants that
a ceiling proceeding was pending, but the number of the said ceiling
proceeding was not mentioned in the written statement. There was
no material before the learned appellate court to come to a finding
that the suit schedule land was the subject matter of dispute in the
ceiling proceeding. The said finding is perverse.
10.           A priori, the judgment and decree of the courts below are
set aside. The matter is remitted back to the learned trial court for de
novo hearing. The parties are allowed to adduce evidence. In order to
avoid further delay, the parties shall appear before the learned trial
court on 10th November, 2017, on which date, the learned trial court
shall fix a date of hearing and conclude the suit within a period of six
months thereafter.
                                              ……..…………………..
