R.S.A. No. 1/2007                                                        1|Page

2.        The plaintiff has filed the second appeal against the judgment and decree dated
21.06.2006, passed by the learned District Judge, Goalpara in Title Appeal No. 2/2003,
dismissing the appeal and upholding the judgment and decree dated 23.05.2003, passed by
the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Goalpara in Title Suit No. 6/2000, whereby the suit
of the plaintiff was dismissed.
3.        The defendant No. 1 in the suit is daughter of Hemkanta Rabha and defendant No. 2
is her husband. Defendant No. 3 is a villager of the same village, of which, the defendant
Nos. 1 and 2 are resident. Plaintiff Bhabani Prasad Rabha, Hemkanta Rabha and Bhong
Rabha were three brothers. Bhong Rabha is the owner and possessor of 22 Bigha 3 Katha 1
Lecha of land as described in the schedule of the plaint. Bhong Rabha died in the year 1990
unmarried, leaving his two brothers as heirs. It was alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff was
dispossessed from 4 Bigha 1 Katha 5 Lecha of land on 06.07.1999, which he was possessing
during the life time of Bhong Rabha and the land was also mutated in his name. It is also
alleged that defendant No. 3 along with other persons had been obstructing the plaintiff
from taking possession of the land. It is the pleaded case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is
entitled to properties left behind by Hemkanta Rabha as he died leaving no male issue and
survived by only defendant No. 1 daughter, who was also married, in view of the fact that
according to old Hindu law and Rabha Customary Law, a married daughter is not entitled to
inherit the properties of her father. Thus, the claim set up is that the plaintiff is entitled to
the entire property which earlier belonged to Late Bhong Rabha.
4.        The Plaintiff had prayed for the following reliefs:
          “(i)    declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to the properties i.e. the suit lands left
                  by Bhong Rabha and Hemkanta Rabha,
          (ii)    possession of the suit lands,
          (iii)   injunction restraining the defendants and the villagers of the Kalajhar village
                  not to disturb the plaintiff in taking possession of the suit lands and
                  afterwards in his peaceful possession of the suit lands,
          (iv)    cost of the suit,
R.S.A. No. 1/2007                                                              2|Page

          (v)     any other relief to which the plaintiff is entitled in law and equity.”
5.        The defendant No. 1 filed written statement stating, amongst others, that the plaintiff
fraudulently got his name mutated in respect of 4 Bigha 1 Katha 5 Lecha of land and that
she had filed objection to cancel the aforesaid mutation. It is asserted that Hindu Succession
Act, 1956, for short, the Succession Act, is applicable to the Rabha community. As Bhong
Rabha was suffering from leprosy, the plaintiff shifted to a distance place. However, father of
the defendant No. 1 nursed the ailing Bhong Rabha, provided shelter to him, and ultimately,
he did in his place. Bhong Rabha executed an unregistered sale deed and delivered
possession to the father of the defendant No. 1 on 12.07.1990 promising to execute a
registered sale deed. But before execution of the sale deed, Bhong Rabha died.
6.        On the basis of the pleadings, the following issues were framed by the learned Trial
Court.
          “1.     Whether there is cause of action for the suit filed by the plaintiff Shri Bhabani
                  Prasad Rabha?
          2.      Whether the defendant No. 3 along with other villagers dispossessed the
                  plaintiff from 4 B – 1 K – 5 L of land covered by Dag No. 64 of village
                  Ghorapota under Matia Circle?
          3.      Whether the plaintiff got his name mutated fraudulently in collusion with
                  officials?
          4.      Whether the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 is applicable to the Rabhas?
          5.      Whether Rabha customary law empowers daughter to inherit father’s
                  property?
          6.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the properties i.e. the lands left by Bhong
                  Rabha and Hemkanta Rabha?
          7.      Whether Bhong Rabha sold his 22 B – 3 K – 1 Lecha to Hemkanta Rabha by
                  unregistered sale deed and gave delivery of possession of the same in
                  presence of some villagers on 12.7.90. Whether suit land owned and
                  possessed by father of defendant No. 1?
          8.      Whether the plaintiff has no right, title and possession to the suit land?
          9.      To what relief/reliefs the parties are entitled to get?”
R.S.A. No. 1/2007                                                              3|Page

7.        Both the Courts below had held that the Succession Act applies to the Rabhas. The
learned Trial Court, though dismissed the suit of the plaintiff, recorded the finding that
Exhibit – ‘Ka’, unregistered sale deed, was inadmissible in law and that the same cannot be
treated to be a valid document.
8.        The learned lower Appellate Court held that the defendant No. 1 is only entitled to
inherit half of the property of Bhong Rabha as the Succession Act is applicable to the parties
and the plaintiff is not entitled to inherit the suit land as the only legal heir of Late Bhong
Rabha.
9.        This second appeal was admitted to be heard by an order passed on 05.01.2007 on
the following substantial questions of law:
          “(i)    Whether the learned appellate Court below committed error in not declaring
                  the title of the plaintiff over half of the suit land on the basis of his findings on
                  title vide para 14 of the judgment?
          (ii)    Whether Hindu Succession Act, 1956 applies to Rabha Community, which is a
                  schedule tribe?”
10.       At the hearing, Mr. S.K. Ghosh, learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that
he will not be urging substantial question of law No. 2 and will confine his argument only to
substantial question of law No. 1. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the
learned lower Appellate Court having held that the plaintiff is also entitled to inherit property
left behind by Late Bhong Rabha in equal share along with defendant No. 1, ought to have
declared right, title and interest of the plaintiff to half of the suit land and ought to have
granted consequential relief by moulding the relief. It is submitted that in view of declaration
of entitlement of the plaintiff to equal share with defendant No. 1, though in the suit the
plaintiff had prayed for ejectment of the defendant from the entire suit land, the plaintiff
would have been entitled to obtain possession to the extent of 50% by means of a
preliminary decree to be followed by a final decree. The learned counsel submits that in
these circumstances, this appeal deserves to be allowed and the case be remanded to the
R.S.A. No. 1/2007                                                               4|Page

learned lower Appellate Court so that the learned lower Appellate Court can address on the
issue of moulding of the relief as the circumstances of the case would permit, in view of the
finding regarding entitlement of the plaintiff to 50% share in respect of the suit property.
11.       Mr. A. Adhikari, learned counsel appearing for the respondents submits that the
plaintiff having prayed for right, title and interest in respect of the entire suit land and
recovery of possession in respect to the said land and the learned lower Appellate Court
having found that the plaintiff is entitled to only equal share with the defendant No. 1, suit
was rightly dismissed. Therefore, there is no merit in this appeal, he submits.
12.       I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the materials on record.
13.       In paragraph 14, the learned lower Appellate Court held as follows:
          “14.    Now, it is clear that both the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 are entitled to
                  inherit the property left behind by Late Bhong Rabha in equal shares though
                  the plaintiff claimed the entire property of Bhong Rabha. Now, if we declare
                  that the plaintiff is entitled to half share of the property left behind by Late
                  Bhong Rabha, it will be an impossibility to pass a decree for khas possession.
                  Therefore, this Court cannot declare that the plaintiff is entitled to inherit the
                  property left behind by Late Bhong Rabha and that he is also entitled to
                  possession thereon. This issue is, accordingly, decided in the affirmative
                  against the plaintiff.”
14.       If the Plaintiff was held to be entitled to the entire suit property, ejectment of the
defendant No. 1 would have followed. Plaintiff prayed for a larger relief, to which, he was
found to be not entitled to. But the fact remains that a categorical finding is recorded that
the plaintiff is entitled to inherit equal share with the defendant No. 1. The learned lower
Appellate Court dismissed the suit only on the ground that it will be an impossibility to pass a
decree for khas possession. The learned lower Appellate Court did not, as rightly pointed out
R.S.A. No. 1/2007                                                            5|Page

by Mr. Ghosh, advert as to whether relief could have been moulded in the circumstances of
the case.
15.       Order VII Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 provides that even if a general
or other relief is not being categorically sought for in the plaint, such relief can always be
granted by the Court by moulding the relief as if it has been prayed for. If the relief claimed
in the plaint is not wholly sufficient or appropriate, under Order VII Rule 7 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908, the Court is vested with the power to grant proper relief according to
the attending facts and circumstances of the case.
16.       Considering the matter in the above perspective, agreeing with the submission of Mr.
Ghosh, the judgment of the learned lower Appellate Court is set aside and the case is
remanded for fresh disposal in accordance with law bearing in mind the observations made
hereinabove. This Court has not expressed any final opinion on the aspect of moulding of the
relief and the case is remanded to the learned lower Appellate Court only because this
aspect of the matter was not considered. The learned lower Appellate Court will not,
however, re-open the issue regarding entitlement of the appellant to equal share to the
property left behind by Late Bhong Rabha along with defendant No.1.
17.       The appeal is allowed as indicated above. No cost.
18.       The parties by themselves or through their counsel will appear before the learned
Court of the District Judge, Goalpara on 16.11.2015.
19.       Registry will send back the records.
                                                                    JUDGE
