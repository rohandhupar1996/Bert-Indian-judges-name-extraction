                   HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                            W.P.(C) No.16390 of 2005
     In the matter of an application under Article 226 of the
     Constitution of India.
                                   -------------
     Sasmita Sahoo & others                           ….  Petitioners
                                      Versus
     CESCO represented through its
     Managing Director & others                       ….  Opposite parties
                 For Petitioners   --     Mr.Samir Kumar Mishra, Adv.
                 For Opp. Parties --      Mr.Banoja Kumar Pattanaik, Adv.
     PRESENT:
                   THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
     Date of Hearing :22.6.2016        &      Date of Judgment: 01.07.2016
Dr.A.K.Rath, J. In this writ petition under Article 226 of the
     Constitution of India, the petitioners have prayed, inter alia, for a
     direction  to   the   opposite    parties   to  pay  an   amount   of
     Rs.5,00,000/- towards compensation for the death of Surendra
     Sahoo in electrocution.
     2.          Shorn of unnecessary details, the short facts of the
     case of the petitioners are that on 29.8.2004 at about 5 A.M when
     Surendra Sahoo, nephew of the petitioner no.1, had gone to pluck
     flower, he came in contact with the electric wire, as a result of

                                    2
which he died due to electrocution. On hearing the cry, the
husband of the petitioner no.1 rushed to the spot. He also came in
contact with the electric wire and died due to electrocution. On the
basis of FIR lodged by petitioner no.1, a case was registered. The
police made inquest and sent the dead body for post mortem. The
doctor, who conducted the post-mortem, opined that the cause of
death was due to electrocution.
3.           Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has
been filed by the opposite parties stating therein that the deceased
came in contact with the electric wire at the back side of house,
which was taken by the neighbour, namely, Sudersan Behera
unauthorisedly. There was no negligence on the part of the
opposite parties. It is further stated that G.R Case No.958 of 2004
was registered against Sudersan Behera and Damodar Pradhan,
which is pending. It is further stated that the petitioners have not
furnished any documents in support of their relationship and
status with the deceased and the age and wages of the deceased.
The legal heir certificate and the certificate showing the age of the
deceased have not been produced. Further no complaint was made
before the authority. The opposite parties had no knowledge about
the theft by hooking. None of the villagers or the petitioners
intimated the authorities regarding the unauthorized consumption
of electricity or hooking. It is further stated that the opposite
parties had taken all cares and adequate steps for proper
maintenance of the electric lines.
4.           Heard Mr.Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioners
and Mr.Pattnaik, learned counsel for the opposite parties.

                                          3
5.          Really two points arise for consideration of this Court ;
            (1)    Whether a writ application under Article 226 of the
                     Constitution of India is maintainable for payment
                     of compensation when death is caused due to
                     electrocution ?
            (2)      Whether opposite parties can deny the liability on
                     the ground that the death of Surendra Kumar
                     Sahoo was due to act of a third party ?
Point Nos.1 and 2.
6.          An identical matter came up for consideration before a
Division Bench of this Court in the case of T. Bimala v. Cuttack
Municipal Corporation, Cuttack and others, 2015(I) OLR-637.                           It
was held as follows:-
     “9.    The language of Article 226 of the Constitution does not admit of
     any limitation on the powers of the High Court for the exercise of
     jurisdiction thereunder. The power conferred upon the High Courts
     under Article 226 of the Constitution is wide enough to reach injustice
     wherever it is found. The apex Court in catena of the decisions laid
     down certain guidelines and self-imposed limitations have been put
     there subject to which the High Courts would exercise jurisdiction.
     Those guidelines cannot be mandatory in all circumstances. When a
     citizen approaches the High Court in writ petition that a wrong is
     caused, the High Court will step into protect him, whether that wrong
     was done by the State or an instrumentality of the State. The High Court
     cannot pull down the shutters.
     10.    In M.S. Grewal v. Deep Chand Sood, (2001) 8 SCC 151, the apex
     Court observed as under :
            “Next is the issue of “maintainability of the writ petition” before the High
            Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The appellants though
            initially very strongly contended that while the negligence aspect has
            been dealt with under penal laws already, the claim for compensation
            cannot but be left to be adjudicated by the civil laws and thus the Civil
            Court’s jurisdiction ought to have been invoked rather than by way of a
            writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. This plea of non-
            maintainability of the writ petition though advanced at the initial stage of
            the submissions but subsequently the same was not pressed and as
            such we need not detain ourselves on that score, excepting however
            recording that the law Courts exist for the society and they have an
            obligation to meet the social aspirations of citizens since law Courts must

                                      4
        also respond to the needs of the people. In this context, reference may be
        made to two decisions of this Court : the first in line is the decision in
        Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa, (AIR 1993 SC 1960) wherein this
        Court relying upon the decision in Rudal Sah (Rudal Sah v. State of
        Bihar), (AIR 1983 SC 1086) decried the illegality and impropriety in
        awarding compensation in a proceeding in which the Court’s power
        under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution stands involved and thus
        observed that it was a clear case for award of compensation to the
        petitioner for custodial death of her son. It is undoubtedly true, however,
        that in the present context, there is no infringement of the State’s
        obligation, unless of course the State can also be termed to be joint
        tortfeasor, but since the case of the parties stands restricted and without
        imparting any liability on the State, we do not deem it expedient to deal
        with the issue any further except noting the two decisions of this Court
        as above and without expression of any opinion in regard thereto.”
11.     In this connection, we would like to profitably quote a paragraph
from a decision of Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Ramesh
Singh Pawar v. Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board and others, AIR 2005
MP 2. It is held as follows:
          “Currently judicial attitude has taken a shift from the old doctrine
          concept and the traditional jurisprudentia system – affection of the
          people has been taken note of rather serious and the judicial concern
          thus stands on a footing to provide expeditious relief to an individual
          when needed rather than taking recourse to the old conservative
          doctrine of the Civil Court’s obligation to award damages. As a matter
          of fact the decision in D.K. Basu has not only dealt with the issue in a
          manner apposite to the social need of the “Country but the learned
          Judge with his usual felicity of expression firmly established the
          current trend of justice-oriented approach”. Law Courts will lose their
          efficacy if they cannot possibly respond to the need of the society –
          technicalities their might be many but the justice-oriented approach
          ought not to be thwarted on the basis of such technicality since
          technicality cannot and ought not to outweigh the course of justice.”
12.     Thus we hold that a writ application for payment of compensation
for the death of a person in electrocution is maintainable when the
undisputed facts clearly reveal the same.
13.     A person undertaking an activity involving hazardous or risky
exposure to human life is liable under law of torts to compensate for the
injury suffered by any other person, irrespective of any negligence or
carelessness on the part of the managers of such undertakings. The
basis of such liability is the foreseeable risk inherent in the very nature
of such activity. The liability cast on such person is known, in law, as
“strict liability”.
14.     The doctrine of strict liability has its origin in English Common
Law when it was propounded in the celebrated case of Rylands v.
Fletcher, 1868 Law Reports (3) HL 330, Justice Blackburn had observed
thus:

                                     5
       “The rule of law is that the person who, for his own purpose, brings on
       his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it
       escapes, must keep it at his peril, and if he does so he is prima facie
       answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its
       escape.”
15.    There are seven exceptions formulated by means of case law to
the said doctrine. One of the exceptions is that “Act of stranger i.e. if the
escape was caused by the unforeceable act of a stranger, the rule does
not apply”. (Winfield on Tort, 15th Edn. Page 535).
16.    The rule of strict liability has been approved and followed in many
subsequent decisions in England and decisions of the apex Court are a
legion to that effect. A Constitution Bench of the apex Court in Charan
Lal Sahu v. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 1480 and a Division Bench in
Gujarat State Road Transport Corpn. V. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai, AIR
1987 SC 1690 had followed with approval the principle in Rylands
(supra). The same principle was reiterated in Kaushnuma Begum v. New
India Assurance Co. Ltd., AIR 2001 SC 485.
17.    Sukamani Das (supra), Timudu Oram (supra) on which reliance
has been placed, the question of a strict liability was not taken up in
those cases.
18. Sukamani cannot be understood as laying a law that in every
case of tortious liability recourse must be had to a suit. When there is
negligence on the face of it and infringement of Article 21 is there, it
cannot be said that there will be any bar to proceed under Article 226 of
the Constitution, since right of life is one the basic human rights
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.(emphasis laid)
19.    In M.P. Electricity Board v. Shail Kumar and others, AIR 2002 SC
551, one Jogendra Singh, a workman in a factory, was returning from
his factory on the night of 23.8.1997 riding on a bicycle. There was rain
and hence the road was partially inundated with water. The cyclist did
not notice the live wire on the road and hence he rode the vehicle over
the wire which twitched and snatched him and he was instantaneously
electrocuted. He fell down and died within minutes. When the action
was brought by his widow and minor son, a plea was taken by the Board
that one Hari Gaikwad had taken a wire from the main supply line in
order to siphon the energy for his own use and the said act of pilferage
was done clandestinely without even the notice of the Board and that
the line got unfastened from the hook and it fell on the road over which
the cycle ridden by the deceased slided resulting in the instantaneous
electrocution. In paragraph 7, the apex Court held as follows:
       “It is an admitted fact that the responsibility to supply electric energy in
       the particular locality was statutorily conferred on the Board. If the
       energy so transmitted causes injury or death of a human, being, who
       gets unknowingly trapped into if the primary liability to compensate the

                                      6
      sufferer is that of the supplier of the electric energy. So long as the
      voltage of electricity transmitted through the wires is potentially of
      dangerous dimension the managers of its supply have the added duty to
      take all safety measures to prevent escape of such energy or to see that
      the wire snapped would not remain live on the road as users of such
      road would be under peril. It is no defence on the part of the
      management of the Board that somebody committed mischief by
      siphoning such energy of his private property and that the electrocution
      was from such diverted line. It is the look out of the managers of the
      supply system to prevent such pilferage by installing necessary devices.
      At any rate, if any live wire got snapped and fell on the public road the
      electric current thereon should automatically have been disrupted.
      Authorities manning such dangerous commodities have extra duty to
      chalk out measures to prevent such mishaps.” (emphasis laid)
20.   The principle of res ipsa loquitur is well known. It is explained in
a very illustrative passage in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edn., pp.
568-569, which reads as follows:
      “Doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The onus of proof, which lies on a party
      alleging negligence is, as pointed out, that he should establish his case
      by a pre-ponderance of probabilities. This he will normally have to do by
      proving that the other party acted carelessly. Such evidence is not always
      forthcoming. It is possible, however, in certain cases for him to rely on
      the mere fact that something happened as affording prima facie evidence
      of want of due care on the other’s part: ‘res ipsa loquitur is a principle
      which helps him to do so’. In effect, therefore, reliance on it is a
      confession by the plaintiff that he has no affirmative evidence of
      negligence. The classic statement of the circumstances in which he is
      able to do so is by Erle, C.J.:
              ‘There must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the
      thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his
      servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things
      does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it
      affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the
      defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.’
      It is no more than a rule of evidence and states no principle of law. “This
      convenient and succinct formula”, said Morris, L.J., “possesses no magic
      qualities; nor has it any added virtue, other than that of brevity, merely
      because it is expressed in Latin”. It is only a convenient label to apply to
      a set of circumstances in which a plaintiff proves a case so as to call for a
      rebuttal from the defendant, without having to allege and prove any
      specific act or omission on the part of the defendant. He merely proves a
      result, not any particular act or omission producing the result. The court
      hears only the plaintiff’s side of the story, and if this makes it more
      probable than not that the occurrence was caused by the negligence of
      the defendant, the doctrine res ipsa loquitur is said to apply, and the
      plaintiff will be entitled to succeed unless the defendant by evidence
      rebuts that probability. It is not necessary for res ipsa loquitur to be
      specifically pleaded.”

                                    7
7.          On the anvil of the decisions cited supra, the case of the
petitioners may be examined. Immediately after the occurrence, the
matter was reported to the police station. The doctor conducted
post mortem on the dead body of the deceased. The post mortem
report reveals that the cause of death was due to electrocution. In
view of the clinching material on record, the conclusion is
irresistible that the husband of petitioner no.1 died due to
electrocution. As held above, a person undertaking an activity
involving hazardous or risky exposure to human life is liable under
law of torts to compensate for the injury suffered by any other
person, irrespective of any negligence or carelessness on the part of
the managers of such undertakings. The basis of such liability is
the foreseeable risk inherent in the very nature of such activity.
Authorities manning such dangerous commodities have extra duty
to chalk out measures to prevent such mishaps. The opposite
parties can not shirk their responsibility on trivial grounds. For the
lackadaisical attitude exhibited by the opposite parties, a valuable
life was lost. Therefore, this Court directs the opposite parties to
pay interim compensation of Rs.2,00,000/-(rupees two lakhs) to
the petitioners within two months leaving the petitioners to work
out   their   remedies   in  the   common    law    forum  for  higher
compensation.
8.          The writ petition is allowed. No costs.
