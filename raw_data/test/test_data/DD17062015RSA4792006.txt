PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE D.DASH
       Date of hearing- 01.05.2015       :  Date of judgment-17.06.2015
       This appeal has been filed challenging the judgment and decree
dated 8.9.2006 passed by the learned Additional District Judge,
Sambalpur in RFA No. 45/54 of 2005 confirming the judgment and
decree passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Sambalpur
in Title Suit No. 63 of 2002.

                                       2
             The trial court having dismissed the suit, the same has
been upheld in the appeal carried by the plaintiff. Thus, the
unsuccessful plaintiff is now in second appeal before this court.
2.           For the sake of convenience, in order to bring clarity and
avoid confusion, the parties hereinafter have been referred to as they
have been arrayed in the court below.
3.           Plaintiff’s case is that one Kamala Lochan Panda who
happens to be his brother-in-law, died on 31.1.2001 leaving behind no
issue. His wife had predeceased him in the year 1997. Since they had
no issue, the plaintiff was taking all their care and they were satisfied
with the service so rendered. Therefore, Kamal Lochan Panda executed
a Will on 20.11.2002 which was registered, bequeathing all his
movable and immovable properties as also those of his wife. So, on the
basis of said registered Will, the plaintiff claims to be the owner in
possession of the said bequeathed property which is the subject matter
of the suit. He states to have let out the suit land to different persons
on rent and had been realizing the same from them. It is further stated
that when the plaintiff remained absent from the village, the
defendants persuaded those tenants not to give rent to the plaintiff
and they claimed to be the owners of the property being the nephew of

                                       3
Kamal Lochan Panda. So, when despite of the demand          the  tenants
did not pay the rent, the suit had to be filed.
4.           The defendants in the written statement while contesting
the suit denied the plaint averments to the effect that the plaintiff was
looking after the affairs of Kamal Lochan Panda as stated. They state
to have been looking after the Kamal Lochan. The execution of Will in
favour of the plaintiff is denied. While further stating that Kamal
Lochan was not in a sound state of mind to execute the said document
in the year 2000 and was confined to bed being affected by the
paralysis since 1980, this deed of Will is said to be a manufactured
document for the purpose.
5.           On such rival pleadings, the important issue to decide the
fate of the suit is as to whether the registered Will dated 20.11.2002
has been duly executed by Kamal Lochan and attested and as such is
valid and genuine one or not.
             The trial court on analysis of oral and documentary
evidence has finally answered the issue against the plaintiff. The lower
appellate court having independently assessed the evidence and being
alive to the settled position of law has arrived at the same conclusion
as that of the trial court. So ultimately holding that Will has not been

                                       4
duly executed has thus, dismissed the suit upholding           the    trial
court view and thereby declining to declare the right, title and interest
of the plaintiff over the suit property on the basis of Ext. 1, the Will.
The appeal has been admitted on the following substantial questions of
law:-
             “A.     Whether it is correct approach to cast the
            burden upon the plaintiff when he has made out a
            prima facie case that the executant is conscious and
            can he be made to counter effect the defendant’s
            statement that he was unconscious?
             B.     Whether the defendants have the burden to
            prove that the executant is not in sound state of mind
            when once a prima facie case to the contrary was
            proved by the plaintiff?”
             C.     Even when the attesting witness name was
            found in the list of witnesses supplied by the plaintiff,
            is it proper not to examine the attesting witness?
             In the instant case, the plaintiff calls in question the
concurrent findings of fact that the plaintiff has failed to prove due

                                       5
execution of the Will Ext. 1 by the testator and also due   attestation
besides the finding that suspicious circumstances have remained
unexplained by the plaintiff and are thus standing on the way of
declaring the Will as the document of title of plaintiff over the
bequeathed properties.
6.           Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the
registered deed of Will Ext.1 has been proved by leading clear, cogent
and acceptable evidence so far as its execution, attestation and
registration are concerned. The courts below have on a perverse
appreciation of evidence arrived at such negative conclusion. He
further contends that the suspicious circumstances as pointed out by
the courts below are not well founded and as such those are not
required to be repelled by leading any evidence or for being explained
through evidence. Therefore, he argues that when the defendants have
failed to discharge the burden of proof by establishing all those facts
as averred by them in the written statement that the executant was
not in sound state of mind, the courts below ought to have decreed the
suit.
7.           Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand
submits in support of the findings by stating that those are based on

                                       6
sound appreciation of evidence on record keeping           the   settled
position of law in view and in the touch stone on the same. He refutes
the submission that such findings of the courts below are perverse.
8.           Before going to address the submission in answering the
substantial questions of law, it is felt necessity to take note of the
settled position of law covering the subject.
              The Apex Court in case of Jaswant Kaur vs. Amrit Kaur
& Ors :AIR 1977 SC 74 has held that normal rule which governs any
legal proceeding is that the burden of proving a fact in issue lies on
him who asserts it, not on him who denies it. In other words, the
burden lies on the party which would fail in the suit if no evidence
were led on the fact alleged by him. Accordingly, it has been stated
that the beneficiary under the Will is to lead satisfactory evidence to
prove the due execution of the Will. In cases where the execution is
shouded with suspicion, its proof ceases to be a simple lies between
the parties. What, generally, is an adversary proceeding becomes in
such cases a matter of the courts conscience and then the true
question which arises for consideration is whether the evidence led by
the pro-pounder of the Will is such as to satisfy the conscience of the
court that the Will was duly executed by the testator. It is impossible

                                         7
to reach such satisfaction unless the party which sets up the Will
offers a cogent and convincing explanation of the suspicious
circumstances surrounding the making of the Will. Referring to the
case of Venkatachala Iyengar vs. B.N. Thimmajamma :AIR 1959 SC
443, the position as expressed therein has been quoted:-
            “1. Stated generally, a will has to be proved like any other
           document, the test to be applied being the usual test of the
           satisfaction of the prudent mind in such matters. As in in
           the case of proof of other documents, so in the case of proof
           of wills, one cannot insist on proof with mathematical
           certainty.
            2.     Since section 63 of the Succession Act requires a will
           to be attested, it cannot be used as evidence until, as
           required by section 63 of the Evidence Act, one attesting
           witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving
           its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive and
           subject to the process of the court and capable of giving
           evidence.
            3.     Unlike other documents, the will speaks from the
           death of the testator and therefore the maker of the will is
           never available for deposing as to the circumstances in
           which the will cane to be executed.
            This aspect introduces an element of solemnity in the
           decision of the question whether the document propounded
           is proved to be the last will and testament of the testator.
           Normally, the onus which lies on the propounder can be
           taken to be discharged on proof of the essential facts which
           go into the making of the will.
           4.      Cases in which the execution of the will is
           surrounded by suspicious circumstances stand on a
           different footing. A shaky signature, a feeble mind, an unfair
           and unjust disposition of property, the propounder himself
           taking a leading part in the making of the will under which
           here receives a substantial benefit and such other
           circumstances raise suspicion about the execution of the
           will. That suspicion cannot be removed by the mere
           assertion the propounder that the will bears the signature of
           the testator or that the testator was in a sound and

                                           8
            disposing state of mind and memory at the time when the
            will was made, or that those like the wife and children of
            the testator who would normally receive their due share in
            his estate were disinherited because the testator might have
            had his own reasons for excluding them. The presence of
            suspicious circumstances makes the initial onus heavier
            and therefore, inc ases where the circumstances attendant
            upon the execution of the will excite the suspicion of the
            court, the propounder must remove all legitimate suspicions
            before the document can be accepted as the last will of the
            testator.
            5.      It is in connection with wills, the execution of which
            is surrounded by suspicious circumstance that the test of
            satisfaction of the judicial conscience has been evolved. That
            test emphasis that in determining the question as to
            whether an instrument produced before the court is the last
            will of the testator, the court is called upon to decide a
            solemn question and by reason of suspicious circumstances
            the court has to be satisfied fully that the will has been
            validly executed by the testator.”
             It has also been therein in the said decision in the said
case as follows:-
            “The party propounding a will or otherwise making a claim
            under a will is no doubt seeking to prove a document and, in
            deciding how it is to be proved, reference must inevitably be
            made to the statutory provisions which govern the proof of
            documents. Sections 67 and 68 of the Evidence Act are
            relevant for this purpose. Under S.67, if a document is
            alleged to be signed by any person, the signature of the said
            person must be proved to be in his handwriting, and for
            proving such a handwriting under Ss. 45 and 47of the Act
            the opinions of experts and of persons acquainted with the
            handwriting of the persons concerned are made relevant.
            Section 68 deals with the proof of the execution of the
            document required by law to be attested; and it provides that
            such a document shall not be used as evidence until one
            attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of
            proving its execution. These provisions prescribe the

                                          9
            requirements and the nature of proof which         must      be
            satisfied by the party who relies on a document in a Court
            of law. Similarly, Ss.59 and 63 of the Indian Succession Act
            are also relevant. Thus the question as to whether the will set
            up by the propounder is proved to be the last will of the
            testator has to be decided in the light of these provisions. It
            would prima facie be true to say that the will has to be
            proved like any other document except as to the special
            requirements of attestation prscribed by S.63 of the Indian
            Succession Act. As in the case of proof of other documents so
            in the case of proof of wills it would be idle to expect proof
            with mathematical certainty. The test to be applied would be
            the usual test of the satisfaction of the prudent mind in such
            matters.
             However, there is one important feature which distinguishes
            will from other documents. Unlike other documents the will
            speaks from the death of the testator, and so, when it is
            propounded or produced before a Court, the testator who has
            already departed the work cannot say whether it is his will or
            not; and this aspect naturally introduces and element of
            solemnity in the decision of the question as to whether the
            document propounded is proved to be the last will and
            testament of the departed testator. Even so, in dealing with
            the proof of wills the court will start on the same enquiry as
            in the case of the proof of documents. The propounder would
            be called upon to show by satisfactory evidence that the will
            was signed by the testator, that the testator at the relevant
            time was in a sound and disposing state of mind, that he
            understood the nature and effect of the dispositions and put
            his signature to be document of his own free will. Ordinarily
            when the evidence adduced in support of the will is
            disinterested, satisfactory and sufficient to prove the sound
            and disposing state of the testator’s mind and his signature
            as required by law, Courts would be justified in making a
            finding in favour of the propounder. In other words, the onus
            of the propounder can be taken to be discharged on proof of
            the essential facts just indicated.”
             In case of Shashi Kumar v. Subodh Kumar: AIR 1964 SC
529 it has been held as under:-
            “The mode of proving a will does not ordinarily differ from that of
            proving any other document except as to the special requirement

                                         10
          of attestation prescribed in the case of a       will     by     S.63,
          Succession Act. The onus of proving the will is on the
          propounder and in the absence of suspicious circumstances
          surrounding the execution of the will, proof of testamentary
          capacity and the signature of the testator as required by law is
          sufficient to discharge the onus. Where however there are
          suspicious circumstances, the onus is on the propounder to
          explain them to the satisfaction of the court before the court
          accepts the will as genuine. Where the caveator alleges undue
          influence, fraud and coercion, the onus is on him to prove the
          same. Even where there are no such pleas but the
          circumstances give rise to doubts, it is for the propounder to
          satisfy the conscience of the court. The suspicious
          circumstances may be as to the genuineness of the signature of
          the testator, the condition of the testator’s mind, the dispositions
          made in the will being unnatural improbable or unfair in the
          light of relevant circumstances or there might be other indicates
          in the will to show that the testator’s mind was not free. In such
          a case the court would naturally expect that all legitimate
          suspicion should be completely removed before the document is
          accepted as the last will of the testator. If the propounder
          himself takes part in the execution of the will which confers a
          substantial benefit on him, that is also a circumstance to be
          taken into account, and the propounder is required to remove
          the doubts by clear and satisfactory evidence. If the propounder
          succeeds in removing the suspicious circumstances the court
          would grant probate, even if the will might be unnatural and
          might cut off wholly or in part near relations.”
           The Apex Court in case of Benga Behera vs. Braja Kishre
Nanda: AIR 2007 SC 1975 has held as follows:-
           “If an authority in performance of a statutory duty signs a
          document, he does not become an attesting witness within the
          meaning of S.3 of the Transfer of Property Act and S.63 of the
          Succession Act. The term ‘attestation’ means:
          “to ‘attest’ is to bear witness to a fact. The essential conditions of
          valid attestation are (i) two or more witnesses have seen the
          executant sign the instrument, (ii) each of them has signed the
          instrument in presence of the executants.”
          “Animus attestandi” is a necessary ingredient for proving the
          attestation. If a person puts his signature in a document only in

                                       11
             discharge of his statutory duty, he may not be treated to be
             an attesting witnesses.”
9.            Keeping in view the above settled position of law, this
Court is now called upon to find out whether the Will projected as the
trump card by the plaintiff for success of the suit satisfies all the above
requirements. But before going to examine the matter in judging
sustainability of the finding of the courts below and in answering the
substantial question of law, it would be useful to make note of the
factors which persuaded to courts below to hold against the execution
of the Will. It is pertinent to mention here that the Will having been
executed in the district of Sambalpur with respect to the properties
situated in that district, the bar under Section 213 of the Indian
Succession Act does not stand on the way of claiming title over the
property covered under the Will without obtaining probate. The Courts
below have found that (i) there has been failure on the part of the
plaintiff to prove the execution of the Will satisfying the requirements
of Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, and Section 68 of the
Evidence Act, (ii) the registration of the Will does not give rise to a
presumption of genuineness of the same and that cannot be the
substitute of the proof of all those required facts in consonance with
Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act and 68 of the Evidence Act.

                                       12
10.          The plaintiff in this case has examined, the scribe
of the Will Ext.1 as P.W.1 and plaintiff himself is P.W.3 whereas P.W.2
is one of the attesting witnesses. It has been the settled position of law
that the scribe of the Will does not stand on footing of the attesting
witness as the animus attestandi which is the necessary ingredient for
proving the attestation does not get satisfied thereby. This scribe
having put in signature in the document in that capacity and in
discharge of duty as such,       cannot be treated to be an attesting
witness and his evidence cannot be taken as the substitute of
evidence of an attesting witness. He has deposed that having scribed
the Will as per the instruction of Kamal Lochan Panda, he had read
over and explained the same to him who understanding the same had
signed on the same and the attesting witness signed thereafter. The
essential conditions of attestation are that two or more witnesses must
have seen the executant signing the instrument and had received from
him a personal acknowledgement of the signature and thereafter each
of them has signed the instrument in presence of the executant. Of
course, in a case where the document is executed and attested in one
stating it may not be a necessary for attesting witnesses to state in
clear words that they have signed as witnesses in presence of the

                                       13
executant. Having already stated the position of law that this P.W.1
cannot stand in the same pedestal as that of an attesting witness and
his evidence cannot be taken for the purpose of proof attestation Will,
it is further seen that he has remained silent on the most important
fact that after the testator signed having understood the contents of
the Will, the attesting witnesses put their signatures. Now comes the
evidence of attesting witness. On going through the evidence of this
witness, it becomes clear that he has only lent his signature to the
document without even knowing the nature of the document much
less its contents. This is evident when it is seen that he has expressed
his inability to say as to whether it was a sale deed or a gift deed or a
Will. His evidence is that he only signed in the document and went
away. Thus, he has not proved the Will to have been executed by the
testator having lent his signature after being read over and explained
with the contents of the said document, Ext. 1 by P.W.1 and having
understood the same to have been correctly written as per his
instruction. The other attesting witness examined on behalf of the
defendants has of course stated all against the factum of execution
and attestation. Be that as it may, this witness has been cross-
examined at length. However, nothing substantial has been brought

                                        14
out even to say that he had reason to depose against        the   plaintiff
and is knowingly suppressing the materials fact. No hint to that effect
also is found out.
              The Will has been registered but as per the settled position
of law that itself is not enough to hold in favour of due execution of the
Will. At this point of time, the other suspicious circumstances which
appear are noteworthy. P.W.3 has stated that on the date of execution
of the Will, Kamal Lochan came to him and told him that he having
taken his care and that of his wife, he would execute a Will and so
asked him to come to Court and accordingly, the Will was executed
and registered on 20.11.2002. P.W.3 then states that on 31.1.2001,
Kamal Lochan died and he performed his Sudhi Kria that is totally
belied by the death certificate Ext. A which has been issued by the
Registrar of Birth and Death on 16.2.2001 long prior to this suit
indicating the date of death to be on 4.2.2001 and registration of the
same to be on 5.2.2001. So when from the beginning, it is stated that
the plaintiff was taking care of Kamal Lochan Panda and his wife and
for that reason Kamal Lochan executed the Will bequeathing all his
properties in favour of the plaintiff ignoring the legal heirs who would
have come to succeed him and his properties, that is found to be false.

                                       15
Further-more, from the Will Ext. 1, it is seen that         considerable
extent of properties are said to have been bequeathed, but there
remains no explanation as to why the member of the family have been
ignored. Giving a bare look at the tenor of the signature, the same
speaks a volume as regards the condition of the testator at that time
who was admittedly aged about 75 years. When it is stated that
Purushottam Bag, the attesting witness D.W.1 had identified the
testator before the Sub-Registrar, he is silent on that score nor even
P.Ws. 1 and 2 have so stated. When the evidence from the side of
defendant remains that Kamal Lochan was not in a fit state of mind
being affected by paralysis, the witness       P.W. 1  being asked has
feigned his ignorance about the mental state of the testator to be then
fit or not but at the next moment has gone to rectify by stating that
the mental condition was then good. P.W.2 even is unable to say as to
if the Will was registered or not. P.W.2 further expresses his ignorance
even as regards the name of other attesting witness.
11.          All these suspicious circumstances have not at all been
repelled by the plaintiff by leading necessary evidence. In that view of
the matter, this Court while answering the substantial questions of
law against the plaintiff holds that the courts below have committed no

                                         16
such error in passing the judgments and decrees and those are
thus held not liable to be interfered with.
12.            In the result, the second appeal stands dismissed.
               In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the
parties are directed to bear their respective costs for their litigation all
throughout.
