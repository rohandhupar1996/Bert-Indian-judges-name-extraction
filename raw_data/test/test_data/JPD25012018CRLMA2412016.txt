                          CRLMA NO.241 OF 2016
                                    ORDER
14 25.01.2018            This is an application under Section 439(2)
              of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer to
              cancel the bail of the present opposite party no.2
              granted by the learned Sessions Judge, Khurdha at
              Bhubaneswar in T.R. Case No.188 of 2015 registered
              under Sections 376/506/34, I.P.C. read with Section
              6 of the POCSO Act.
              2.         In this case, the F.I.R. was lodged by the
              mother of the victim alleging that on 20.02.2015
              evening, the opposite party no.2 kidnapped her minor
              daughter from her house at Jagatsinghpur and she
              had lodged one F.I.R. at Jagatsinghpur Police Station
              which was registered and her daughter was rescued
              by the Police from the house of the opposite party no.2
              at village Kalapathar and was handed over to the
              informant. Thereafter, she along with her daughters
              was staying at Rental Colony, Bhubaneswar and once
              taking advantage of her absence in her house, the
              opposite party no.2 allegedly came to her house and
              forcibly committed rape on her minor daughter. He
              further gave threats not to disclose anything before
              anybody. Subsequently, the informant could come to
              know that her daughter has pregnancy of seven
              months for the alleged acts of the opposite party no.2
              for which she lodged the F.I.R. before Nayapalli Police
              Station, Bhubaneswar pursuant to which this case

                2
was registered and the accused was arrested.
3.         The learned Sessions Judge by the order
dated 14.01.2016 granted bail to the opposite party
no.2 with the observations that in the case registered
at Jagatsinghpur the victim has stated before the
Police that she had voluntarily accompanied with the
accused to his house and stayed there for a few days
with his family members till she was rescued by the
Police. She had also stated that no indecent behavior
was meted out towards her during the said period. Of
course the victim in her statement recorded under
Section 164, Cr.P.C. in this case alleged rape resulting
in her pregnancy of seven months, but the learned
Sessions Judge observed that the matter was not
reported to the Police immediately after the occurrence
but only after about seven to eight months when the
accused allegedly refused to marry the victim.
4.         Now,    it has  been   submitted that     the
accused opposite party no.2 is giving out regular
threats to the informant and her daughter, the victim,
to   withdraw     the  cases  or   else  to   face  dire
consequences. It has been further submitted that
despite the report submitted by the informant to the
Police against such acts of the accused, no action is
being taken. Hence cancellation of the bail granted to
him has been prayed for.

                  3
5.          It is the settled principle of law that the bail
once granted, should not be cancelled in a mechanical
manner without considering whether any supervening
circumstances have rendered it no longer conducive to
a fair trial to allow the accused to retain his freedom
by enjoying the bail granted during trial. Very cogent
and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an
order directing cancellation        of bail. Mostly, the
grounds such as interference or attempt to interfere in
due course of administration of justice or an attempt
to evade the same are the material considerations
while considering an application for cancellation of
bail.
6.          In the case at hand, the only allegation that
has been made against the accused-opposite party is
that he is giving out threats to the informant and her
daughter and Police is taking no action against him.
7.          As per the instruction obtained on behalf of
the State having been called for, some station diaries
have been made on such report of threat made by the
informant but no case has been registered. It is the
allegation that the opposite party no.2 is giving out
threats over phone to the informant and his daughter.
Separate affidavits have been filed in that regard.
8.          Considering     the   submissions     and   the
circumstances of the case and the factual backdrop as
stated hereinbefore, I am of the considered view that

                    4
    there   are  no sufficient materials or established
    circumstances so as to cancel the bail granted to the
    petitioner.   Accordingly,   this   application  stands
    rejected.
    9.          However, it is made clear that the opposite
    party no.2 should not involve himself in any act of the
    alleged type and if any report is submitted by the
    informant or her daughter before the Police alleging
    any overt-act against the opposite party no.2, it shall
    be promptly registered and due investigation should
    be taken up by the concerned police station.
          The petition is disposed of accordingly.
                                              …………………
