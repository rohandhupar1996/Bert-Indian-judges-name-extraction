           PRESENT:
                  THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE INDRAJIT MAHANTY.
                              Date of Judgment : 18.04.2012
I. Mahanty, J.       In this appeal, under Section 37 of the Arbitration and
           Conciliation Act, 1996, the State of Orissa has sought to challenge an
           order dated 25.07.2007 passed by the learned District Judge, Cuttack
           in Arbitration Petition No.153 of 2004, by which an application under
           Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short the
           ‘1996 Act’) filed by the State challenging the award dated 24.08.2004
           passed by the Arbitrator Shri S.K. Mohanty, came to be dismissed.

                                  2
2.        The opposite party-Sri Gokul Chandra Kanungo, a special
class contractor was entrusted with the execution of the contract
work, i.e., “Construction of missing link from Kanjipani to Kuntala, a
distance of 3 Kms. on N.H.-6-11th from 33/0 to 33/3”. The opposite
party was entrusted with the obligation to carry out the aforesaid
contract by virtue of an agreement No.3F2/71-72 and the said work
was stipulated to be commenced on 16.12.1971 and completed within
one year, i.e., 15.12.1972.
3.        It appears that the execution of work commenced on the
stipulated date, but could not be completed within the stipulated
period of one year. The total work was valued at Rs.4,59,330/- and the
opposite party-contractor was paid Rs.3,36,465/- for the work
executed by him pending final measurement. The final measurement
was done on 15.12.1975 and final bill was prepared on 16.06.1976.
The opposite party-contractor accepted the final measurement on
30.08.1977. In the year 1989, the State of Orissa intimated the
opposite party-contractor that “over-payment” had been made to him
before the final measurement as he had been paid Rs.3,36,465/-
against his entitlement of Rs.3,34,744/-. In other words, it was
claimed that the opposite party had been over-paid of Rs.1,721/-. The
State in their letter dated 10.08.1989 demanded from the opposite
party-contractor to refund the excess amount paid to him.

                                   3
          The opposite party-contractor thereafter filed Original Suit
No.206/1989-I in the court of the Civil Judge (Sr. Division),
Bhubaneswar under Section 20 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940
praying for reference of the dispute for adjudication. The suit was
decreed on 14.02.1990 and the appellants were directed to file the
original agreement in the court, for reference of the dispute to
arbitration.
          However since the State did not file the agreement in the
court the direction remained uncomplied and in the meantime, the
1996 Act came into force. The opposite party-contractor filed another
application before the self-same court i.e. Civil Judge (Sr. Division),
Bhubaneswar praying for referring the dispute to arbitrator under the
provisions of the 1996 Act. This application of the contractor was
rejected, on the ground that the said court had no authority under
1996 Act to appoint an Arbitrator. Being aggrieved by the said order,
the opposite party-contractor filed M.J.C. No.37 of 2000 before the
High Court praying for appointment of an arbitrator. Although, the
State raised its objections to the same, the Hon’ble Acting Chief
Justice by order dated 15.10.2001 appointed Sri S.K. Mohanty, a
retired Judge of this Court, as an Arbitrator.
          The State thereafter filed a writ application i.e. O.J.C. 5325 of
2002 before the High Court questioning the correctness of the order

                                   4
dated 15.10.2001 appointing the Arbitrator. The writ application was
however dismissed and the contention of the State was negatived. It
appears that the State filed a separate application before the Hon’ble
Chief Justice on 26.02.2004 praying for recall of the order dated
15.10.2001 appointing the arbitrator under the 1996 Act and this
petition also came to be disposed by granting the State liberty to raise
the question of jurisdiction before the Arbitrator.
4.        The State essentially raised issues regarding the jurisdiction/
appointment of arbitrator to the dispute in that proceeding. That issue
came to be decided in favour of the opposite party-contractor and the
Arbitrator came to hold that he possessed the necessary jurisdiction to
act as an Arbitrator and arbitrate upon the dispute referred to him.
5.        Learned Addl. Standing Counsel raised the contention that
the Arbitrator had erred in law in coming to the conclusion that he
possessed the jurisdiction to act as an Arbitrator over the dispute. He
further submitted that the Arbitrator had committed grave illegality by
answering the issue of limitation in favour of the contractor. Learned
State counsel for the appellant also argued that, the claim of the
opposite party-contractor was hopelessly barred by limitation. His
further contention was that while the original value of the contract
work awarded was Rs.4,59,330/-, and the opposite party-contractor
had already been paid Rs.3,36,465/-, the award passed by the

                                  5
Arbitrator was for a sum of Rs.9,20,650/- even though a part of the
work remained incomplete. This, it is asserted, was excess, illegal and
further award of Rs.46,90,000/- towards “interest” which is more than
five times the principal amount, was wholly without jurisdiction. He
further contended that the Arbitrator awarded exorbitant interest
pendentelite by awarding interest @ 18% per annum. His further
contention was that the Arbitrator had awarded some payments in
favour of the opposite party-contractor for certain extra work which
was not included in F-2 agreement. In the light of the submissions
made, learned counsel contended that the award being wholly illegal
should be set aside.
6.        The aforesaid contentions were also raised before the learned
District Judge in Arbitration Petition No.153 of 2004 and on
consideration of the same, as well as the contentions raised by the
opposite party-contractor, the learned District Judge rejected the
petition filed by the State under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. Being
aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been filed.
7.        In course of hearing, the main challenge, made by the leaned
counsel for the State, was on the issue of limitation. Learned counsel
for the State submitted that the Arbitrator should not have entertained
the claim of the opposite party-contractor and should have held the
claim to be barred by limitation.

                                   6
         The next plea by learned counsel for the State related to
alleged award of exorbitant interest @ 18% per annum for pendentelite
and future as directed by the Arbitrator.
8.       Mr. Singh, learned Addl. Standing Counsel fairly submitted
that the present Arbitration Appeal is similar in nature to Arbitration
Appeal No.27 of 2004 between the self-same parties and the issues
raised by the State hereunder have been already adjudicated by this
Court by the Bench presided over by Hon’ble Shri Justice L.
Mohapatra who by the judgment dated 02.09.2005 came to dismiss
the appeal. It is fairly stated by the learned counsel for the State that
the said Award has already been executed. In the light of the
observations made in that judgment, learned Addl. Standing Counsel
submitted that although the present appeal is covered by the said
judgment, he intends to canvas the issue of limitation, which
according to him, has not been decided in the judgment arising out of
the connected appeal.
9.       Mr. Singh, learned counsel for the State, placed reliance on
the judgment of this Court in the case of Secretary to Govt. of
Orissa,   Irrigation     Department      and   others    v.  Raghunath
Mohapatra, 59 (1985) C.L.T. 133. Placing reliance on the aforesaid
judgment, Mr. Singh submitted that even though the State has not
raised any plea regarding limitation before the Arbitrator, such plea of

                                    7
limitation affects the jurisdiction of the Court, it is open to the State to
raise the issue of limitation before the Court, even after the arbitration
proceedings were over. In this respect, Mr. Singh placed reliance upon
paragraph-5 of the judgment which is quoted hereunder:
                       “Mr. Y. Das, learned counsel appearing for
          the respondent, submitted that in their counter in
          Misc. Case No.8 of 1980 the appellants had nowhere
          pleaded that the respondent’s application under
          Section 8(2) of the Act was barred by limitation and as
          such it was not open to the appellants to raise this
          question before the court after the arbitration
          proceedings in which they had participated were over.
          The learned Addl. Government Advocate countered
          this argument and submitted that the issue of
          limitation affects the jurisdiction of the court and
          therefore it was open to the appellants to plead the
          issue of limitation before the court even after the
          arbitration proceedings were over.”
          Mr. Singh also placed reliance upon the judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of State of Rajasthan and another v.
M/s. Nav Bharat Construction Co., AIR 2002 Supreme Court 258,
wherein, the Hon’ble Supreme Court while affirming the Award in the
said case reduced the rate of interest awarded from 18% to 6% and
prayed for similar direction in the present case.
10.       Mr. Kanungo, learned counsel appearing for the opposite
party-contractor submitted that the issues raised by the State were no
more res integra since the connected Arbitration Appeal No.27 of 2004
had been dismissed by this Court and further, since the State have
already satisfied the Award in the said case by effecting the payment.

                                  8
          So far as the issue of limitation is concerned, Mr. Kanungo
submitted that once an issue of limitation is not raised before the
Arbitrator, this Court is not required to go into determining the said
issue, since the contention advanced by the learned counsel for the
appellants, that the respondent’s claim is time barred, is not
sustainable. In this respect, he placed reliance on a judgment of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Secretary, Irrigation and
Power Department, Government of Orissa and another v. Niranjan
Swain, (1989) 4 SCC 269, wherein, a three Judges Bench of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court, presided by Mr. Justice A.M. Ahmadi (as His
Lordship then was) came to held that a plea before the Court that the
claim was time barred, was not required to be gone into, unless the
question of limitation was raised before the Arbitrator.
11.       Insofar as the question of quantum of interest is concerned,
Mr. Kanungo, learned counsel for the opposite party-contractor
submitted that it is well settled that the award of interest is to be
made by an Arbitrator based on various consideration and the award
of interest @ 18% per annum was in accordance with the prevailing
interest at the time when the award was passed i.e. on 24.08.2004. It
is, therefore, asserted that the quantum of interest was neither
exorbitant nor any challenge to the same ought to be entertained.

                                 9
12.       Having heard the learned counsel for the respective parties
and having noted their respective contentions hereinabove, it is
admitted that in a connected arbitration proceeding award was
rendered by Hon’ble Justice B.N.Dash (Retd.) between the selfsame
party in M.J.C. No.37 of 2000 dated 27.02.2003 and the award was
also upheld by the High Court vide its order dated 02.09.2005 passed
in ARBA No.27 of 2004. It is admitted that the present case at hand is
similar to the type of work operated in the earlier case and in the said
award, Hon’ble Justice B.N. Dash (Retd.) had awarded interest @ 19.½
% per annum. It is further similar to note that the State Government
had finally accepted the award passed and also made the payment due
thereunder.
          In ARBA No.27 of 2004, the matter was heard by Hon’ble
Justice L. Mohapatra, wherein the appeal filed by the State raising the
selfsame contention as dealt herein came to be rejected vide judgment
dated 02.09.2005.
13.       Apart from the aforesaid fact, for the present purpose it is
suffice to note that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
Secretary, Irrigation and Power Department, Govt. of Orissa and
Anr. (supra) has categorically came to hold that unless a contention is
raised before the Arbitrator, the same cannot be raised subsequently

                                    10
and in this respect, paragraph-2 of the aforesaid judgment is quoted
hereunder.
          “2. The learned counsel for the appellant raised
          three contentions: (i) that the claim was time
          barred; (ii) the Arbitrator could not have awarded
          interest; and (iii) that the award was based on no
          evidence. On the first and the last questions, we
          see no merit for the simple reason that the
          question of limitation was not raised before the
          Arbitrator and the Arbitrator was not required to
          go into it.”
          Apart from the above, it is also well settled by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court that, in a given case the appellate Court is competent
to modify the award qua the rate of interest and reduce the same as
held in the case of State of Rajasthan and another v. M/s. Nav
Bharat Construction Co. (supra). But in the facts and circumstances
of the present case, since the similar claim had already been
adjudicated in a separate proceeding by Hon’ble Justice B.N. Dash
(Retd.), in which His Lordships has awarded interest @ 19.½% per
annum and the said award after challenge in ARBA No.27 of 2004 had
came to satisfy and the State have effectively made payment of the
same, in my considered view award of interest @ 18% per annum in
the present case is wholly justified keeping in view the interest rate
prevailing at the time of award i.e. in the year, 2004.

                                  11
14.         In consideration of the aforesaid facts and the case laws
noted hereinabove, I am of the considered view that the present case
merits no further consideration and the same stands dismissed.
                                            ………………………..
