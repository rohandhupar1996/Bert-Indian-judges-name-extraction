     In the matter of an application under Article 227 of the Constitution

              to 4
     PRESENT:
                   THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
     Date of hearing: 17.02.2016           :    Date of judgment: 24.02.2016
Dr. A.K.Rath, J          The sole question that arises for consideration in
     this writ petition is as to whether a proceeding under Section 23 of
     the Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as “the
     OLR Act”) is maintainable, if any transfer is made by a person
     belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in favour of a
     person belonging to non-Scheduled Caste or Non-Scheduled Tribe in
     contravention of Section 7(b)(i) of the Orissa Merged States (Laws)
     Act, 1950 ?
     2.           Opposite party no.1 is a member of Scheduled Tribe. He
     filed an application under Section 23-A of the OLR Act before the
     Revenue Officer, Patnagarh, opposite party no.2, for restoration of
     the land alienated by his father Jhankar Majhi by means of RSD

                                    2
No.120 dated 24.1.1964 in favour of the father of the petitioners. It is
stated that he is Binjhal by caste and member of the Scheduled Tribe
community, which was registered as Revenue Misc. Case No.8/10 of
1990. His case is that opposite parties are Bhulia by caste and do not
belong to Scheduled Tribe. No permission to alienate the land was
obtained from the competent authority. The transfer is invalid and
contrary to the provision of the Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act,
1950. The petitioners filed an objection to the same contending, inter
alia, that there was no legal prohibition for transfer of the land by the
member of the Scheduled Tribe in favour of a member belonging to
non Scheduled Tribe in the year 1964 under the Orissa Merged
States (Laws) Act, 1950 and, as such, prior permission from the
Revenue Authorities was not at all necessary. Pursuant to the
transfer made by the father of the petitioners, they are in possession
of the land and acquired title by adverse possession. By order dated
30.6.1994, opposite party no.2 came to hold that the transfer was
made in contravention of the Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950
and, as such, void. Burden lay on the petitioners to prove the same
and mere possession of 12 years will not amount to adverse
possession. The petitioners had not adduced any evidence regarding
adverse possession. Held so, the opposite party no.2 allowed the
application and restored the possession of the land to the opposite
party no.1. The petitioners unsuccessfully challenged the said order
before the Addl. District Magistrate, Bolangir, opposite party no.3, in
OLR Appeal No.8 of 1994, which was eventually dismissed on
28.2.2000. Thereafter, they filed revision before the Collector,
Bolangir, opposite party no.4, which was registered as OLR Revision
No.2 of 2000. The revision met with the same fate and was
dismissed.

                                       3
3.          Mr. Budhiram Das, learned counsel for the petitioners,
submitted that to press the legal necessity, Jhankar Majhi, father of
the opposite party no.1 sold the land in favour of the father of the
petitioners by means of RSD No.120 dated 24.1.1964 for a valid
consideration and thereafter delivered possession. Their father was in
possession of the land and after his demise, they are in possession of
the same. He submitted that restriction with regard to the alienation
of land as provided under Section 7(b)(i) of the Orissa Merged States
(Laws) Act, 1950 was no more in force pursuant to the amendment
made in Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (By
Scheduled Tribes) Regulations, 1956 Orissa (Regulation 2 of 1956).
Further, Section 23-A of the OLR Act was inserted to the statute
book by Orissa Act No.44 of 1976 and, as such, the proceeding is
bad in law. He submitted that even otherwise the petitioners by
remaining the land peacefully and continuously with hostile animus
to owner for more than twelve years, have perfected title by way of
adverse possession.
4.          Per contra Mr. Soumya Mishra, learned counsel for the
opposite party no.1 and learned Addl. Government Advocate for
opposite parties 2 to 4 supported the impugned order.
5.          Section 22 of the OLR Act imposes restriction on
alienation of land by Scheduled Tribes to a person not belonging to
Scheduled Tribes. Sections 22, 23-A of the OLR Act and Section
7(b)(i) of the Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950, which are
relevant, are quoted hereunder:
            Orissa Land Reforms Act, 1960 :
            “22. Restriction on alienation of land by Scheduled
            Tribes - (1) Any transfer of holding or part thereof by a
            raiyat, belonging to a Scheduled Tribe shall be void except
            where it is in favour of –
                   (a) a person not belonging to a Scheduled Tribe; or

                           4
       (b) a person not belonging to a Scheduled Tribe
       when such transfer is made with the previous
       permission in writing of the Revenue Officer :
       Provided that in case of a transfer by sale, the
Revenue Officer shall not grant such permission unless
he is satisfied that a purchaser belonging to a Scheduled
Tribe willing to pay the market price for the land is not
available, and in case of a gift unless he is satisfied about
the bona fides thereof.
       (2) The State Government may, having regard to the
law and custom applicable to any area prior to the date of
commencement of this Act by notification, direct that the
restrictions provided in Sub-section (1) shall not apply to
lands situated in such area or belonging to any particular
tribe throughout the State or in any part of it.
       (3) Except with the written permission of the
Revenue Officer, no such holding shall be sold in
execution of a decree to any person not belonging to a
Scheduled Tribe.
       (4) Not withstanding anything contained in any
other law for the time being in force, where any document
required to be registered under the provisions of Clause
(a) to Clause (e) of Sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the
Registration Act, 1908, (16 of 1908) purports to effect
transfer of a holding or part thereof by a raiyat belonging
to a Scheduled Tribe, in favour of a person not belonging
to a Scheduled Tribe, no Registering Officer appointed
under that Act shall register any such document, unless
such documents is accompanied by the written
permission of the Revenue Officer for such transfer.
       (5) The provisions contained in Sub-sections (1) to
(4) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the transfer of a
holding or part thereof of a raiyat belonging to the
Scheduled Caste.
       (6) Nothing in this Section shall apply –
       (a) to any sale in execution of a money decree
       passed, or to any transfer by way of mortgage
       executed, in favour of any Scheduled Bank or in
       favour of any Bank to which the Orissa Co-
       operative Societies Act, 1962 (2 of 1963 ) applies;
       and
       (b) to any transfer by a member of a Scheduled
       Tribe within a scheduled area.

23-A. Eviction of person in unauthorized occupation
of property - Where any person is found to be in
unauthorised occupation of the whole or part of a holding

                                      5
           of a raiyat belonging to a Scheduled Caste or of a raiyat
           belonging to a Scheduled Tribe within any part of the
           State other than a Scheduled Area, by way of trespass or
           otherwise, the Revenue Officer may either on application
           by the owner or any person interested therein, or on his
           own motion and after giving the parties concerned an
           opportunity of being heard, order eviction of the person so
           found to be in unauthorised occupation and shall cause
           restoration of the property to the said raiyat or to his heir
           in accordance with the provisions of Sub-section (3) of
           section 23.

           Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950 :
           7. Modification of Tenancy Laws in force in the
           merged States -
           (b) an occupancy tenant shall be entitled –
           (i) to freely transfer his holding subject to the restriction
           that no transfer of a holding from a member of an
           aboriginal tribe to a member of a non-aboriginal tribe
           shall be valid unless such transfer is made with the
           previous permission of the Subdivisional Officer
           concerned;
6.         It is apt to state here that Section 7(b)(i) of the Orissa
Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950 was repealed under Regulation 9 of
1956. The same is quoted below:
           “The words “subject to the restrictions that no transfer
           of a holding from a member of an aboriginal tribe to a
           member of a non-aboriginal tribe to a member of a non-
           aboriginal tribe shall be valid unless such transfer is
           made with the previous permission of the Sub-
           Divisional Magistrate concerned in item 1 of Clause [(d)
           of Section have been omitted.]”
7.         On an interpretation of Section 23 of the OLR Act, a
Division Bench of this Court, in the case of Anadi Mohanta (dead)
and after him Kointa Mohanta and others v. State of Orissa and
others, 68 (1989) CLT 1, came to hold that the transfer in
contravention of any other law would normally not come within the
purview of Section 23 of the Act. Section 23-A was introduced by the
Act 44 of 1976 in the O.L.R Act, which provides that where any

                                   6
person is found to be unauthorised occupation of the whole or part of
a holding belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe within
any part of the State other than a Scheduled Area, by way of trespass
or otherwise, the Revenue Officer may, either on application by the
owner or any person interested therein or on his own motion, and
after giving the parties concerned an opportunity of being heard,
order eviction of the person so found to be in unauthorised
occupation and shall cause restoration of the property to the said
owner or to his heir in accordance with the provisions contained in
Sub-section (3) of Section 23. Thus, the transfer by a person
belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in favour of a
person belonging to a non-Scheduled Caste or non-Scheduled Tribe,
if prohibited by any other law in force, may come within the scope of
Section 23-A of the Act, as such a transferee may be called to be in
unauthorised occupation of the property within the meaning of the
said Section. Clause in Section 7(b) of the Orissa Merged States’
(Laws) Act, 1950 that “no transfer of a holding by a member of
aboriginal tribe to a member of non-aboriginal tribe shall be valid
unless the transfer is made with the previous permission of the
Subdivisional Officer concerned,” has been repealed by Orissa
Regulation 2 of 1956. The said Regulation imposes a similar
restriction in Clause 3 thereof, but it provides that it would be
applicable to transfers of immovable property situated within the
“scheduled areas”. The phrase “Scheduled Areas” as it stood in the
aforesaid Regulation before its amendment by Regulation 1 of 1979
means “Scheduled Areas” specified in respect of the State of Orissa in
the Scheduled Areas (Part A States), Order, 1950. The District of
Keonjhar was not specified as one of the Scheduled Areas in the
aforesaid Order of 1950. By Regulation 1 of 1979 the definition of
“Scheduled Areas” was changed to include the “areas specified in

                                     7
respect of the State of Orissa in the Scheduled Areas (States of Bihar,
Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa) Order, 1977”. By notification
in the year 1977 the district of Keonjhar was specified as a
Scheduled Areas. Therefore, the restrictions on transfer by a member
of aboriginal Tribe to a non-aboriginal tribe which was originally
therein the Orissa Merged States’ (Laws) Act, 1950 was lifted by
repeal of the said provision in the year 1956 by Regulation 2 of 1956
and during the time when the transfers in question took place, there
was no par in law requiring permission of any authority as a
condition precedent.
8.          But then a contrary view has been taken by another
Division Bench in the case of Srikar Bag v. Revenue Officer,
Titilagarh and others, 1993 (II) OLR 95. Though the case of Anadi
Mohanta (supra) was cited, but the learned Judges did not agree with
the view taken in Anadi Mohanta (supra). It was held that the
transfer by opposite party no.4- a Scheduled Tribe in favour of the
petitioner- non Scheduled Tribe being in contravention of the
provision contained in Section 7(1)(b) of the Orissa Merged States
(Laws) Act, 1950 is invalid and consequently the occupation of the
land in question by the petitioner therein was unauthorised. It was
further held that the provision contained in Section 7(1)(b) of the
Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950 was not repealed by
Regulation No.2 of 1956 so far as the district of Bolangir is
concerned.
9.          Dealing with ‘repeal’ made in Clause (9) of Regulation
No.2 of 1956, the Division Bench in Srikar Bag (supra) held thus:
                  “7. Clause (9) of Regulation No. 2 deals with repeal.
            According to Clause (9)(1)(b) on and from the date of
            commencement of this Regulation the following shall stand
            repealed, namely :

                                       8
                   "The enactments mentioned in column 2 of the
                   Schedule to the extent specified in column 3 thereof
                   in so far as they are in force in the Scheduled Areas."
            Column 2 of item No. 2 of the Schedule states about Orissa
            Merged States (Laws) act, 1950, 1950 and Column 3 which
            deals the extent of repeal says that the words ''subject to
            the restriction that no transfer of a holding from a member
            of an aboriginal Tribe to a member of a non-aboriginal
            Tribe shall be valid unless such transfer is made with the
            previous permission of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate
            concerned" appearing in item 1 of Clause (b) of Section 7
            shall be omitted. When this extent of repeal is read in
            conjunction with Clause (9)(1)(h), there remains no room
            for doubt that Section 7 (1)(b) of the Orissa Merged States
            (Laws) Act 1950 came to be repealed only for the Scheduled
            Areas as defined in the aforesaid regulation and not for all
            the merged States. Then, it is to be seen whether the land
            in question transferred was within any Scheduled Area as
            defined in Regulation No. 2 of 1956. The expression
            "Scheduled Areas" as it stood in the aforesaid Regulation
            prior to its amendment by Regulation No. 1 of 1979 was
            defined to mean "Scheduled Areas" specified in respect of
            the State of Orissa in the Scheduled Areas (Part A States)
            Order, 1950. The district of Bolangir within which the land
            transferred situates was not specified as one of the
            Scheduled Areas in the aforesaid Order of 1950. By
            Regulation 1 of 1979, the definition of "Scheduled Areas"
            was changed to include the areas specified in respect of the
            State of Orissa in "Scheduled Areas'' (States of Bihar,
            Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa) Order, 1977" and on
            a reference to the said Order of 1977, we find that in the
            said Order also the district of Bolangir had not been
            included. Therefore, the provision contained in Section
            7(1)(b) of the Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950 was
            not repealed by Regulation No. 2 of 1956 so far as the
            district of Bolangir is concerned.”            (Emphasis laid)
            It was held that the Areas Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950
has application throughout the merged States in the State of Orissa
and Regulation 2 of 1956 has application only to the Scheduled
Areas. In other words, baring the Scheduled Areas, the provision
contained in the Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950 is applicable
to the other Merged States of Orissa. Since Keonjhar District referred

                                      9
in the reported case and the Bolangir district were not within the
Scheduled Areas, the provisions contained in the Orissa Merged
States (Laws) Act, 1950 has application to those districts in the year
1965 when the transfer in the present case took place. Held so, the
Division Bench did not agree with the view taken in Anadi Mohanta
(supra).
10.         The next question is when there are divergent views
expressed by the Division Benches of the High Court, which decision
would be followed?
11.         In Jabalpur Bus Operators’ Association v. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AIR 2003 Madh Pra 81, it is held that :
            “With regard to High Court, a Single Bench is bound by
            the decision of another Single Bench. In case he does not
            agree with the view of other Single Bench, he should refer
            the matter to Larger Bench. Similarly, Division Bench is
            bound by the judgment of earlier Division Bench. In case
            it does not agree with the view of the earlier Division
            Bench, it should refer the matter to Larger Bench. In case
            of conflict between judgments of two Division Benches of
            equal strength, the decision of earlier Division Bench
            shall be followed except when it is explained by the latter
            Division Bench in which case the decision of latter
            Division Bench shall be binding. The decision of Larger
            Bench is binding on Smaller Benches.”        (Emphasis laid)
12.         The same view has been taken by another Full Bench of
the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Wali Mohammed and etc. v.
Batulbai and etc., 2003 Crl. L.J. 2755. It is held thus:
            “….in case of conflict between two decisions of the High
            Court rendered by the Benches of equal strength (be it a
            Full Bench, Division Bench or single Bench), the decision
            earlier in time shall hold the field unless it is referred and
            explained in the latter decision in which case the latter
            one shall be binding...”
13.         In view of the same, this Court is of the opinion that the
latter decision in the case of Srikar Bag (supra) is to be followed.

                                    10
14.         The irresistible conclusion is that the transfer of land by
the father of the opposite party no.1 in favour of the father of the
petitioner no.1 being in contravention of Section 7(b)(i) of the Orissa
Merged States (Laws) Act, 1950 is invalid. Consequently occupation
of the land in question by the petitioners is unauthorised.
15.         So far as the second contention of Mr. Das, learned
counsel for the petitioners, that the petitioners have perfected title by
way of adverse possession, the submission is difficult to fathom.
16.         In the celebrated judgment, the Privy Council in the
Secretary of State v. Debendra Lal Khan, AIR 1934 Privy Council 23
held that the classical requirement of adverse possession is that the
possession should be nec vi nec clam nec precario. Their Lordships
quoted with approval the decision in the case of Radhamoni Devi v.
The Collector of Khulna and others, Indian Appeals 1900 Vol. XXVII
at page 140 that “the possession required must be adequate in
continuity, in publicity, and in extent to shew that it is possession
adverse to the competitor”.
17.         Except bald assertion in the objection filed by the
petitioners that they have perfected title by adverse possession, there
is no material on record to come to a definite conclusion that the
petitioners have perfected title by way of adverse possession.
            The petition, sans any merit, is dismissed.
                                         ………………………..
