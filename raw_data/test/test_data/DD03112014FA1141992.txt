                  In this appeal the appellant challenges the award passed by the
learned Sub- ordinate Judge, Dhenkanal (as it was then) in L.A. Misc. Case
No.152 of 1991 in the matter of reference under Section 18 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894.
2.                Facts necessary for disposal as of this appeal are as under:-
                  Land measuring Ac. 0.58 decimals from out of total land under
khata no.66 in Mouza Nimabahali in the Balimi Police Station in the district of

                                      2
Dhenkanal was acquired by the State for the purpose of right main canal for
Rengali Irrigation Project. Necessary notification under section 4(1) of the Act
was published in the official gazette on 02.02.1988. The total land as stated
above comprises of Ac. 0.02 decimals from Plot No.430 in Patita Kissam; Ac.
0.21 decimals from Plot No.2050 of Sarad II Kissam; Ac.0.22 decimals from Plot
No.2079 under Sarad III Kissam and Ac.0.05 decimals from Plot No.2080 in
Patita Kissam.
3.             The Land Acquisition Collector assessed compensation at
Rs.9019 for the purpose. The appellant challenged that it is wholly inadequate
stating that the Railway Station, National Highway and NALCO being there
near the land, its potentiality is too high. So he claimed enhancement of
compensation expressing his dissatisfaction with regard to the said assessment
of the compensation, more particularly in respect of the market value of the
acquired land. That is how the reference came to be made.
4.             The appellant in the said proceeding proved a sale deed Ext-1
showing that in the mid of 1987 nearby land of an extent Ac.0.08 decimals was
sold at Rs.2600/-. Another sale deed Ext-2 has also been proved to show that
an area Ac.0.11 decimals of land in the very year 1987 in the first quarter has
been sold at Rs.4,000/-. It is asserted that the acquired land’s market value
would be much more than what has been by the fixed by the Land Acquisition
Collector. The appellant advanced a claim for enhancement of compensation by
determining the market value of the land at Rs.20,000/- per acre.

                                        3
5.             Four witnesses have been examined for the side of the claimant
of appellant, when the adversary has examined two. It is seen that both under
Ext.1 and 2 land has been sold one year prior to the publication of the
notification under Section 4(1) of the Act for acquisition of the land in question.
6.             The referral court having found the land covered those sale deeds
to be in different mouzas of course in view of evidence has accepted of the
evidence of claimant’s witnesses that the NALCO site, Railway Station, National
Highway, weekly market are near the acquired land. Next taking into
consideration the market value of Nimabahali and Galapada Mouza in respect
of Taila, Sarad II and Sarad III, variety of land, the referral court has determined
the market value of Sarad II Kissam land at Rs.20,000/- per acre, Sarad III
Kissam of land at Rs.15,000/- per acre whereas Patita land at Rs.10,000/- per
acre.
7.             Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the referral court
ought to have determined the valuation of the acquired land in accordance with
the consideration as stated in the sale transaction in Exts. 1 and 2. This is
refuted of the learned counsel for the State on the ground that there is no
evidence that the acquired land even though is situated a different mouza have
all the equal advantages attached to it including the similarity of their nature of
user.
8.             On going through the evidence of the witnesses examined from
the side of the appellant, it is seen that the evidence is lacking on the above

                                                   4
        score as submitted by the learned counsel for the State and that has been
        rightly taken note of by the referral court, while enhancing the market value of
        the acquire land and refusing to adhere to the market value as per the
        consideration indicated under Ext.1 and 2.
                           Therefore, no such legality or infirmity is found in the matter of
        appreciation of evidence by the referral court in determining of market value of
        the land acquired which is the subject matter of the proceeding.
                           No such other materials are either placed or noticed so as to
        suggest that the determination of compensation in the case is unjust, improper
        or unreasonable being so determined ignoring those.
        9.                 Resultantly, the appeal stands dismissed.
