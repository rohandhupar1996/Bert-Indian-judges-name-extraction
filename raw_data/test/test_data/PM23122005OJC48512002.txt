                                          AND
           THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE PRADIP MOHANTY
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Date of judgment : 23.12.2005
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRADIP MOHANTY,J. In this writ application, the petitioners challenge
    the order dated 04.04.2002 of the Central Administrative Tribunal,
    Cuttack Bench, passed in O.A. No.555 of 2001.
    2.                    The brief facts of the case are that the opposite
    party was working as Head Clerk in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.
    While working as such, he being disgusted with the repeated orders
    of his transfer made a representation to the petitioners on
    04.10.2001 indicating his option that unless his grievances with
    regard to transfer, etc. are considered, the said representation be
    treated as notice for his voluntary retirement under Rule 48-A of

                                 2
Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (for short, “the Rules”).
After receipt of the so-called notice for voluntary retirement, the
petitioners accepted the same within 15 days of tendering of the
notice. Thereafter, the opposite party approached the Tribunal by
filing the aforesaid O.A. with a prayer for quashing the order
accepting his so- called notice for voluntary retirement and for
reinstatement. The Tribunal, by the impugned order, observed that
the opposite party could not have asked for going on voluntary
retirement without putting the Department to a notice of three
months. It also observed that no reasoned order has been passed by
the authorities in accepting the notice for voluntary retirement and
hence quashed the order of voluntary retirement. Aggrieved, the
petitioners have approached this Court.
3.                  The case of the petitioners is that after receipt of
the notice dated 04.10.2001 for voluntary retirement under Rule 48-
A of the Rules, they have accepted the same on 19.10.2001, i.e.,
within fifteen days of tendering the notice. They have rightly done so
as per Rule 48-A (3-A)(b) of the Rules, for which no fault can be
found with them.
4.                  Mr. Ashok Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for the petitioners, submitted that the impugned order is
illegal, without jurisdiction and the Tribunal has erred in law in
setting aside the order accepting the voluntary retirement of
opposite party no.1. He further submitted that the petitioners are
competent to pass such order under Rule 48-A (3-A)(b), which
provides that the authorities can consider and curtail the period of
notice of three months if they are satisfied that such curtailment will
not cause any administrative inconvenience.
5.                  On the other hand, Mr. J. Mohanty, learned
counsel appearing for the opposite party, supported the order of the
Tribunal quashing the order of voluntary retirement.
6.                  To appreciate the rival contentions of the parties,
it is necessary to refer to Rule 48-A of the Rules, the relevant portion
of which is extracted hereinbelow:-

                                3
           “48-A. Retirement on completion of 20
           years’ qualifying service – (1) At any time
           after a Government servant has completed
           twenty years’ qualifying service, he may,
           bygiving notice of not less than three months
           in writing to the appointing authority, retire
           from service:
           xx                    xx                     xx
           (3-A) (a) A Government servant referred to in
           sub-rule (1) may make a request in writing to
           the appointing authority to accept notice of
           voluntary retirement of less than three
           months giving reasons therefor.
           (b) On receipt of a request under Clause (a)
           the Appointment Authority, subject to the
           provisions of Sub-Rule 2, may consider such
           request for the curtailment of the period of
           notice of three months on merits and if it is
           satisfied that the curtailment of the period of
           notice will not cause any administrative
           inconvenience, the Appointing Authority may
           relax the requirement of notice of three
           months with the condition that the
           Government servant shall not apply for
           commutation of a part of his pension before
           the expiry of the period of notice of three
           months.
           xx                     xx                    xx”
From the above provision, it is crystal clear that three months notice
is necessary for voluntary retirement.           Only in exceptional
circumstances, and on a request being made by the employee
concerned giving reasons therefor, the authorities can waive or
curtail the three months notice if they are satisfied that the
curtailment of the period of notice will not cause any administrative
inconvenience subject to the condition that the Government servant
shall not apply for commutation of his pension within three months.
7.                  A bare reading of the notice goes to show that it is
not a notice under Rule 48-A (3-A)(a), rather it is a representation
wherein the opposite party-employee has made so many grievances

                                     4
     including his transfers. Being disgusted with the repeated orders of
     transfer, he has made the representation and has also mentioned
     that unless his grievances are redressed, the same be treated as a
     notice under Rule 48-A. That means, it was not a voluntary one;
     rather it appears to be a conditional one. In other words, the notice
     was the outcome of frustration and disgust. In view of this peculiar
     nature of notice, the authorities should have been careful and
     circumspect before accepting the same. But, as it appears, instead
     of exercising the power in a diligent manner, the authorities have
     hurriedly accepted the notice without assigning any reason as to
     why such acceptance was made before completion of three months.
     The order of the authorities accepting the voluntary retirement is
     not in terms of rule 48-A(3A)(b) of the Rules. Therefore, the Tribunal
     has committed no illegality, infirmity or manifest error of law in
     setting aside the said order.
     8.                 In the result, this writ petition has no merit and is
     accordingly dismissed. No costs.
                                                    ………………………….
