                                   W.P.(C) No.26933 of 2013
02. 13.12.2013               Heard learned counsel for the parties.
                             It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
               petitioner that the petitioner-company is the owner of the
               vehicle    bearing  Registration    No.OR-05-AC/8277       and   the
               opposite party is not granting permit and fitness certificate in
               respect of the said vehicle as the petitioner-company is in
               default of paying tax and penalty for some period. Learned
               counsel for the petitioner further submits that the petitioner-
               company is willing to deposit the tax, but the penalty amount
               being excessive, the same may be reduced.
                             Considering the submissions made, it is directed
               that if the petitioner-company pays the tax demanded by
               28.12.2013 and undertakes before the opposite party to pay
               60%     of  the  penalty  amount     in three    equal  consecutive
               instalments, i.e., by 13.01.2014, 29.01.2014 and 13.02.2014,
               then on payment of tax and the first instalment of the penalty,
               it’s application shall be considered and permit and fitness
               certificate shall be granted in favour of it, provided that the
               petitioner-company has not incurred any other dues in the
               meantime and the vehicle is otherwise fit to ply on the road. It
               is further observed that such permit and fitness certificate may
               be cancelled by the opposite party in the event of default in
               payment of the aforesaid instalments of penalty amount by the
               dates stipulated above or default in payment of any other dues
               accrued against the petitioner-company. In that event, the
               petitioner-company shall be able to pay the whole of the
               amount of penalty imposed. If the 60% of the penalty amount is
               paid by the dates stipulated, the balance penalty amount shall
               stand waived.
                             The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
                             Issue urgent certified copy as per rules.
                                                               ………………………
                                                                S.C. Parija, J.
