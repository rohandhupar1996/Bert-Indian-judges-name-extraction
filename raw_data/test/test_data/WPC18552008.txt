Date of hearing and Judgment            : 19.8.2015.
                              JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
         Heard Ms. A. Bhattacharjee, the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner
union i.e. Assam Chah Mazdoor Karmachari Sangha which is espousing the cause of the
delinquent clerk Pulak Chandra Borthakur of the Dufflating T.E. The management is
represented by the learned counsel Mr. A. Sarma.
2.       While serving as a garden clerk in the Dufflating T.E., a show cause notice was
issued against the petitioner on 20.8.2011 (Annexure-1) but this notice was discarded
and eventually the charge memo was issued on 21.9.2001 (Annexure-3), where 21
charges were leveled against the workman, where it was alleged that the garden clerk
was responsible for preparing the attendance record, plucking accounts and payment of
wages for the workers engaged during the tea plucking session and the substance of
the charge was that the attendance records were manipulated to illegally show presence
of absentee workers and thereby payment were shown to have been made to them in
Writ Petition (C) No.1855/2008                                                Page 1 of 6

the wage register but those amounts were actually misappropriated by the delinquent
clerk.
3.       Since the management did not press the Charge Nos,14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 & 21
and failed to prove the Charge Nos.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 & 19, in this proceeding we are
concerned only with 5 charges and those are extracted here-in-below for ready
reference:
         “………………………………..
         2.        It is alleged that Smt. Amirun Nissa was paid wages for the period
         as follows:
         From 20-06-2001 to 03-07-2001 =               Rs.420.78
         From 04-07-2001 to 17-07-2001 =               Rs.456.59
         From 18-07-2001 to 31-07-2001 =               Rs.240.21
         From 01-08-2001 to 14-08-2001 =               Rs.213.05
                   However, from records, it was seen that she was absent on duty
         from 20-06-2001 to 28-08-2001 and as such you have alleged to have
         paid wages to a worker who was not on duty as above as and thus
         misappropriated the above amounts.
         3.        It is alleged that you have marked present of Smt. Sajoni Bakti from
         8-8-2001 to 14-8-2001 and paid wages for all these period amounting to
         Rs.202.29.
                   However, from our records based on hospital receipts and
         admission & discharge slips, it was confirmed that she was an indoor
         patient at Jorhat Christian Medical Centre from 9-8-2001 to 13-8-2001.
                   This is alleged to have been a clear case defraud on the company.
         4.        It is alleged that Smti. Birajo Munda, W/O. Sri Matias Munda was
         absent from duty from 8.7.2001 till date. However, you continued to mark
         her present on duty during all these period and an amount of Rs.1244.86
         was drawn from the Company for her payment which was actually not
         paid.
         5.        It is confirmed that Smti. Birchi Bhuyan worked only on 1 (one) day
         in W/E 14-8-2001 but you alleged to have paid wages for 2 (two) days
         amounting to Rs.84.32, but actual payment for 1 (one) day should have
         been Rs.42.78 only.
         ………………………………
         13.       Smti. Lakhi was shown as present in work on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th,
         10th, 13th & 14th August, 2001, calculated wages and alleged to have been
         paid to her.
                   However, from her own statement of claim, she worked only for 5
         (five) days. It is alleged that she was denied complete payment and thus
         you misappropriated the whole amount to Rs.297.14 only.
         ………………………………..”
4.       The delinquent in his written reply furnished on 29.9.2001 (Annexure-4),
accepted that some absentee workers were marked present in the attendance register
but he explained the same by claiming the prevalence of the badli system where a
member fulfill the plucking target of the absentee worker and in those cases, the
Writ Petition (C) No.1855/2008                                                Page 2 of 6

payment is shown on account of the garden worker but wages are paid to the one who
worked as the substitute worker.
5.       The reply was found to be unsatisfactory and thus a domestic inquiry was held
and on the basis of the guilty finding, the management dismissed the delinquent w.e.f.
6.11.2001. Accordingly a reference was drawn up under Section 10 of the Industrial
Disputes Act on the legality of the dismissal order and the matter was referred for
consideration of the learned Industrial Tribunal at Dibrugarh. The management chose
not to rely on the domestic inquiry and accordingly evidence was allowed to be adduced
by both sides before the Industrial Tribunal in the reference proceeding. In order to
sustain the disciplinary action, the management adduced 11 witnesses, whereas the
Trade Union adduced two defence witnesses to prove the case of the workman.
6.1.     On the charge No.2 pertaining to payment of wages to Amirun Nissa, when she
was absent from duty while being admitted in hospital from 9.8.2001 to 13.8.2001, the
evidence of MW.8 Manuar Hussain (husband of Amirun Nissa) was taken into account
which established that Amirun Nissa was admitted in the hospital and was absent till
17.8.2001 but since wage payment against her account was made by the delinquent,
the 2nd charge was found to be partially proved for the period from 1.8.2001 to
14.8.2001.
6.2.     Against the 3rd charge, the plucker Smt. Sajoni Bakti was shown to be present
for duty from 8.8.2001 to 14.8.2001 and her salary was drawn for the said period. But
during the relevant time, Sajoni Bakti was in the Jorhat Christian Medical Centre to
attend to her sick child from 9.8.2001 to 13.8.2001 and accordingly on the basis of the
medical records and the attendance register and the wage register, the 3rd charge was
held to have been proved by the learned Tribunal.
6.3.     Similarly another T.E. worker Smti. Birajo Munda was on maternity leave from
8.7.2001 to 17.8.2001 but the worker was shown to be present and wages were drawn
in her account by the delinquent clerk. Therefore the 4th charge was found to have been
partially proved.
6.4.     The non-payment of wages to the T.E. worker Smti. Birchi Bhuyan against
Charge No.5 was held to have been established on the basis of the complaint given by
the worker herself by connecting the oral testimony with the attendance register and
the wage register. Hence the wages due to this worker was found to have been
misappropriated by the delinquent clerk who maintained the registers and disbursed
payments.
Writ Petition (C) No.1855/2008                                              Page 3 of 6

6.5.     The charge No.13 related to the worker Smti Lakhi Kahar. Her presence was
recorded for 8 days from 1.8.2001 to 14.8.2001 in the attendance register but the
concerned worker had worked only for 5 days and thus some misappropriation on
account of this worker was also found to be proved against the delinquent.
7.       By evaluating the evidence adduced before it, the learned Tribunal concluded
that the management succeeded in proving the charge Nos.3 and 5 fully but they could
only partially prove the charge Nos.2, 4 and 13 against the delinquent and accordingly
gross misconduct of misappropriation was held to have been established against the
garden clerk. The loss of confidence of the management was treated to be a natural
corollary for such serious charge and accordingly the dismissal decision of the
management was answered against the delinquent through the impugned award dated
29.6.2007, rendered by the learned Industrial Tribunal.
8.1.     Assailing the legality of the award in favour of the dismissal decision, Ms. A.
Bhattacharyya, learned counsel submits that it is not a case of misappropriation as the
garden clerk followed the practice of badli system and hence showed payment against
the absentee workers and therefore it is argued that the charge of misappropriation is
not logically established on the basis of the available evidence.
8.2.     The learned counsel for the Union refers to the evidence of the delinquent clerk
to show that other employees were present when the wages are disbursed to the T.E.
workers and on this basis, Ms. Bhattacharyya argues that the learned Tribunal erred in
answering the reference against the delinquent.
8.3.     Ms. Bhattacharyya submits that the punishment for a long serving employee is
disproportionate and the learned Industrial Tribunal should have appreciated the serious
consequence of the punishment of dismissal inflicted upon the delinquent.
8.4.     The petitioner relies on the Workmen of M/s. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. of
India (Pvt.) Ltd. reported in (1973) 1 SCC 813 to argue that this is a case of
victimization and unfair labour practice of the management and the learned Industrial
Tribunal failed to appreciate the evidence in its correct perspective to do justice to the
long serving employee.
9.1.     On the other hand Mr. A. Sarma, the learned counsel submits that a clear case
of systematic defalcation of the entries in the attendance register and wage register is
established from the evidence and since it is admitted by the delinquent clerk that he
maintained these registers and made payment to the garden workers, the
misappropriation of money over a long period of time by the clerk is clearly established.

9.2.     The learned lawyer for the management refers to the evidence of MW.4 and
MW.11 to project that the system of badli worker was not prevalent in the Dufflating
T.E. and since no evidence was adduced to the contrary by the delinquent clerk, the
conclusion on the basis of available evidence is submitted to be conclusive.
10.      When a workman is dismissed from service in pursuant to a disciplinary
proceeding and a Writ Petition is filed, the Supreme Court in State Bank of India vs.
Narendra Kumar Pandey reported in (2013) 2 SCC 740 held that while exercising powers
under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court does not sit as an Appellate
Authority. Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and confined to correct error of law or
procedural error resulting in manifest miscarriage of justice or violation of the principles
of natural justice. Moreover the High Court should not re-appreciate the evidence to
reach a different conclusion, if the decision of the disciplinary authority is supported by
relevant evidence.
11.      Proceeding on the above basis, if we analyze the evidence, what is seen here is
that the delinquent in his cross-examination had admitted that it is his duty to prepare
the attendance records and pay the wage to the T.E. workers during the plucking
season and most significantly all the exhibited register(s) are in the handwriting of the
delinquent clerk. Although a plea of payment made to the badli worker is pleaded in
defence, no evidence was adduced by the delinquent to show the prevalence of the
system of badli worker in the Dufflating T.E.
12.      On the other hand, the MW.4 Pabin Bagti in his evidence clearly stated that
there is no badli system prevalent in the T.E. Similar testimony was given by the MW.11
who testified that badli workers are not engaged for the absentee workers during the
plucking season and hence wages can’t be shown to be paid against them.
13.      The evidence of MW.9 Retneswar Bhuyan indicates the modus operandi of the
delinquent clerk. According to this witness, after wages are disbursed to all the T.E.s’
workers, from the surplus amount, Rs.120/- is given by the delinquent to the MW.9 and
with this money the garden clerk and other staff used to purchase liquor and this
practice of stealing from the till was continuing for quite sometimes.
14.      It is also discernable from the evidence of MW.4, MW.5, MW.7 and MW.11 that
the amount shown in the payment register was never paid/fully paid to the concerned
worker(s) and obviously the differential amounts were misappropriated by the garden
clerk, as can be seen from the oral and documentary evidence produced before the
Industrial Tribunal.
Writ Petition (C) No.1855/2008                                                  Page 5 of 6

15.      When a disciplinary proceeding is drawn up against an employee, the standard
of proof is preponderance of probabilities and some relevant material to justify the
conclusion reached by the Enquiry Officer and the writ Court is not expected to act as
an appellate authority to judge the merit of the conclusion reached by the Enquiry
Officer. Interference would be justified only when there is procedural error leading to
manifest injustice. But in the present case, as earlier noted, the delinquent was afforded
a fair opportunity to defend the charges and the conclusion of the disciplinary authority
is based on oral and documentary evidence.
16.      In the present case, the garden clerk is found guilty of systematic pilferage or
misappropriation from the wage bills of the workers and under such circumstances, the
loss of confidence of the management can’t be said to be unreasonable. Therefore in
my view, the punishment of dismissal for such serious misconduct does not justify
interference of the High Court, as this is not found to be a case of victimization of the
delinquent clerk. Moreover the conclusions reached by the Industrial Tribunal on the five
charges in my perception are established adequately from the exhibited register(s) and
oral testimony of the witnesses and no infirmity is found with this conclusion. In such
circumstances, the ratio of Workmen of M/s. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. of India
(Pvt.) Ltd. (Supra) can have no application in the present case.
17.      In view of the above discussion, the challenge to the award of the Industrial
Tribunal is found to be devoid of merit and accordingly the case is dismissed, without
any order on cost.
                                                                                  JUDGE
Barman.
