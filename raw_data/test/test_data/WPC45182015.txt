                                          BEFORE
                           HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE T. VAIPHEI
                           For the petitioner:   Mr. I. Hussain, Advocate
                           For the respondents: Mr. N. Sarma, Standing Counsel
                                                 Elementary Education Deptt.
                           Date of Hearing :      07-08-2015
                           Date of Judgment:      25-08-2015
                                  JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
                Aggrieved by the decision of the Director of Elementary Education,
        Assam     (respondent    2)  rejecting  the   claim   of    the   petitioner for
        provincialization of his service against the post of Assistant Teacher of
        Purbanchal M.E. School, he is once again approaching this Court for
        appropriate relief.
        2.      According to the petitioner, he was appointed by the Managing
        Committee of the Purbanchal M.E. School, Lakhimpur District on 25-8-
        1991 as the founder teacher, but the Headmaster of the school (respondent
        6), with a view to keep him out of school, did not allow him to put his
        signature in the attendance register by keeping the same at his residence.
        In the latter part of 2004, he had fallen seriously sick and undergone major
        operation at Life Care Nursing Home, Kishanganj, Bihar on two occasions.
        He had duly informed the respondent No. 6 about this and asked him to
        allow his wife to take classes ill his return, but was not allowed to do so.
        Even after his return, his attempt to take classes was thwarted by the
WP(C) No.4518/2015                                                                     Page 2 of 4

        respondent No. 6. In the year 2010, when financial grants were sanctioned
        by the State Government, he approached the respondent No. 5 and 6 for
        payment of his share. However, he came to learn that his service had
        already been terminated in 2005 as he had remained absent for long: he
        had never been informed about his termination nor had he been given a
        notice. The respondent No. 7 was appointed as Hindi Teacher in his place to
        accommodate the respondent No. 8 as Assistant Teacher thereby denying
        him of provincialization of service. When he approached the School
        Managing Committee, the Committee passed the resolution dated 1-6-2010
        re-appointing him as the 6th Assistant Teacher of the school. As per the
        rules, the services of only five teachers could be provincialized, he would be
        deprived of the benefit of provincialization as he is the 6th Assistant
        Teacher. He, therefore, filed a representation to the District Elementary
        Education     Officer,  and    Deputy     Commissioner,    Lakhimpur    District
        whereupon an enquiry was conducted, which, however, was done in a
        haphazard manner and without hearing him. This prompted him to file
        WP(C) No. 1526/13 before this Court, which by the order dated 25-11-2013
        had directed the respondent No. 2 to hear the parties and pass an
        appropriate order. The respondent No. 2 passed the impugned order.
        Aggrieved by this, this writ petition is now preferred by the petitioner.
        3.      No affidavit-in-opposition is filed by the State-respondents. However,
        on perusing the writ petition and after hearing Mr. I. Hussain, the learned
        counsel for the petitioner, and Mr. N. Sarma, the learned standing counsel
        for the Education (Elementary) Department, Assam, at some length, I am of
        the view that there is absolutely no merit in the case of the petitioner.
        Under Section 4(2) of the Assam Venture Educational Institutions
        (Provincialization of Services) Act, 2011 the number of employees in both
        teaching and non-teaching cadre in each of the Venture Educational
        Institution, whose services are provincialized or to be provincialized under
        the Act, shall not exceed as specified in the Schedule appended to the Act.
        In the case of LP School, the number of Assistant Teacher is two in the case
        of posts (General) whereas for mixed schools, there are four posts of
        Assistant Teacher. In the instant case, the petitioner happens to be the 6th
WP(C) No.4518/2015                                                                    Page 3 of 4

        Assistant Teacher of the school, which has now become a bit crowded.
        There is now absolutely no possibility of provincializing the service of the
        petitioner as the Assistant Teacher of the school: he is at the most an
        excess teacher. The view taken by the respondent No. 2 in rejecting the
        claim for provincialization of his service by the petitioner does not suffer
        from any infirmity warranting the interference of this Court.
        4.      For the reasons stated in the foregoing, there is no merit in this writ
        petition, which is, therefore, dismissed. The parties are, however, directed
        to bear their respective costs.
                                                                             JUDGE
