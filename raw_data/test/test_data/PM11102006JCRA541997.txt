                   Heard.
2.                 Accused in Sessions Case No.65/21 of 1996 of the court
of Addl. Sessions Judge, Balangir has filed this appeal from jail
challenging to the judgment dated 28.02.1997 by which the trial court
convicted him for the offence under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him
to undergo imprisonment for life.
3.                 Prosecution case is that on 09.03.1996 in the morning
hours between 9 and 10 a.m. accused allegedly assaulted his daughter-
in-law, Rajani, the deceased, by means of an axe (M.O.I) and by dealing

                                 2
repeated blows severed the head from the trunk. That occurrence was
witnessed by Goutam Bariha (P.W.2) being a neighbour of the accused.
He also snatched away the axe from the hands of the accused. Another
co-villager Raghunath Putel (P.W.4) witnessed the snatching of the axe by
P.W.2 from the accused. Villagers detained the accused in the clubhouse
of the village, police was informed by Budhu Seth (P.W.1), he lodged the
FIR (Ext.5) and thereafter the Officer in-charge of Khaparakhol P.S.
(P.W.5) took up investigation. In course of such investigation, the head
and trunk of the deceased, after inquest, were sent for post mortem
examination and Dr. R.N. Tripathy (P.W.3) together with another doctor
conducted post-mortem examination and submitted the report, Ext.3.
They also examined the axe produced with the query if that could have
been the weapon of offence and the opinion report (Ext.4) was submitted
in the affirmative. Blood stained earth, wearing apparels of the accused
and deceased besides some other relevant materials seized in course of
investigation were sent for chemical analysis and serological test by the
State Forensic Science Laboratory at Rasulgarh.      After completion of
investigation, charge-sheet was submitted against the accused for the
offence under Section 302 IPC. Charge was framed for the said offence,
accused pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial.     In course of trial,
prosecution examined the aforesaid five witnesses and relied on the
documents marked Exts.1 to 13 and the Material Objects, M.Os.I to III,
out of which the axe is M.O.I. Accused did not adduce any evidence in
support of his defence plea of denial.   On assessment of evidence on
record, learned Addl. Sessions Judge found the evidence of P.W.2, the
sole eye witness to the occurrence to be true and trust worthy and
corroborated by the evidence of P.Ws.3 and 4 on all material aspect.
Accordingly, he held the accused guilty of the offence of murder and
convicted and sentenced him in the manner indicated above.
4.               While challenging the aforesaid order of conviction,
Mr.Panda, learned counsel engaged by the Legal Aid submits that
evidence of P.W.2 is not acceptable inasmuch as his evidence is not true
and trust worthy and that prosecution did not produce other eye

                                 3
witnesses and circumstantial evidence from other sources. That is the
bone of contention so as to discredit the prosecution version and to
challenge the basis of finding of the trial court.
                Mr. Mohanty, learned Addl. Standing Counsel, however,
wholeheartedly supports the impugned judgment and argues to maintain
the order of conviction and in that process replies to the contentions
raised by the appellant.
5.              On perusal of the evidence on record, the charge and the
finding recorded by the trial court besides the aforesaid argument, we
find that the trial court as well as the counsels appearing for the parties
have missed one significant point that the trial court has not
categorically recorded a finding if the deceased suffered a homicidal
death. Such casual approach should have been avoided. In the above
context, we may mention that in paragraph 7 of the judgment trial court
has stated that evidence of P.W.3 proves that accused killed the
deceased, but such fact was noted by the trial court in the context of
appreciating evidence of P.W.2. Keeping in view provision of law in
Section 302 read with Section 300 IPC, it is the duty of the court to find
out if the deceased suffered homicidal death inasmuch as non-homicidal
death is not punishable under Section 302, IPC. Be that as it may, since
this Court has also jurisdiction to record finding on the basis of evidence
on record, we refer to the evidence of P.W.3 and we find that the said
doctor has given evidence that there were as many as four incised
injuries on and around the neck region, which resulted in severing the
head from the trunk.      It has been categorically mentioned in the post
mortem report that the cause of death was due to haemorrhage and
shock because of cutting of large vessels of the neck and spinal cord.
Thus, it has been proved beyond doubt that the deceased suffered a
homicidal death.
6.              So far as proof of charge against the accused is
concerned, evidence of P.W.2, the solitary eye witness to the occurrence,
clinches the issue against the accused. Contention of the appellant is
that non-production of other eye witnesses is detrimental to the

                                  4
prosecution case. That argument is heard to be rejected, inasmuch as
there is lack of evidence that any other person was eye witness to the
occurrence. Apart from that, trial court in paragraph 9 of the judgment
while answering to such an argument raised in the court below has
rightly observed that it is the quality and not the quantity of the evidence
which matters most in a criminal trial.       Evidence of P.W.2, when he
states about the accused, as the author of the crime, has remained
unshaken and that proves the charge of murder against the appellant.
Seizure of the weapon of offence and consequence of non-detection of
group of human blood have been considered by the court below and
reconsideration of the same, in the absence of illegality, is not necessary.
In the written notes of submission, learned counsel for the appellant has
also raised several other points, but none of them has any merit. For
example, the trial court has not referred to Ext.13 nor has it recorded
any finding against the accused on the basis of that report, yet
submission has been made challenging the correctness of the report from
the S.F.S.L. (Ext.13).
7.              Be that as it may, as discussed above, we find that once
the deceased suffered homicidal death and it has been proved that
accused is the author of that crime, under such circumstances, when we
do not find any illegality or perversity in the finding of guilt recorded
against the appellant by the court below, there is no reason to interfere
with the impugned order of conviction and the sentence. The Jail
Criminal Appeal is accordingly dismissed.
