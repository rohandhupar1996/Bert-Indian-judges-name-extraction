         ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Date of Hearing and Order: 21.12.2016

S. K. Sahoo, J.       This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner
         Subhendu Kumar Swain challenging the impugned order dated
         11.08.2016 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jajpur in
         Criminal Appeal No. 40 of 2016 in directing the petitioner to
         deposit a sum of Rs.2,70,000/- (rupees two lakhs seventy

                                 2
thousand) before the learned Trial Court within one month
pending final disposal of the appeal.
             It appears from the record that the petitioner faced
trial in the Court of learned J.M.F.C., Jajpur Road in I.C.C. No.28
of 2014/Trial No.463 of 2014 for the offence punishable under
section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act and vide impugned
judgment and order dated 26.04.2016, the learned Trial Court
found the petitioner guilty under section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act and sentenced him to undergo S.I. for a period
of two years and to pay a sum of Rs.27,00,000/- (rupees twenty
seven lakhs) to the complainant-opposite party under section
357 of Cr.P.C. and in default of payment of said compensation
amount, the petitioner was directed to suffer S.I. for two
months.
             When the appeal was preferred by the petitioner
challenging the impugned judgment and order of conviction and
sentence passed by the learned Trial Court before the learned
Sessions Judge, Jajpur in Criminal Appeal No.40 of 2016 along
with two miscellaneous applications i.e. one for bail and other for
stay of operation of the Trial Court judgment, the learned
Sessions Judge in charge, Jajpur vide order dated 23.05.2016
admitted the appeal and allowed the petitioner to be released on

                                3
bail and also stayed the operation of the impugned judgment
dated 26.04.2016 passed by the learned Trial Court till disposal
of the appeal.
            Subsequently     the    complainant-opposite    party
entered appearance in the criminal appeal on being noticed and
filed an application on dated 29.06.2016 to direct the petitioner
to deposit a portion of the awarded compensation amount in
view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the cases of
Stanny Felix Pinto -Vrs.- M/s. Jangid Builders Pvt. Ltd.
reported in (2001) 20 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 305,
Dilip S. Dahanukar -Vrs.- Kotak Mahindra Co. Ltd. reported
in (2007) 37 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 395 and of this
Court in the case of Bikram Kumar Jena -Vrs.- State of
Orissa reported in (2010) 47 Orissa Criminal Reports 90.
            Considering the ratio of the aforesaid decisions, the
learned Appellate Court directed the petitioner to deposit a sum
of Rs.2,70,000/- (rupees two lakhs seventy thousand) which is
impugned in this revision petition.
            It is contended that by the learned counsel for the
petitioner Mr. Kashinath Pattnaik that while passing the order
dated 23.05.2016 at the time of admitting the appeal, since two
miscellaneous applications were filed for the bail and for stay

                                4
and both were allowed by the learned Appellate Court and it was
directed that the operation of the impugned judgment of the
Trial Court shall remain stayed till disposal of the appeal,
therefore, the learned Appellate Court was not justified in
passing the impugned order dated 11.08.2016 in virtually
recalling the earlier order passed on 23.05.2016 in staying the
operation of the Trial Court judgment and directing the petitioner
to deposit a sum of Rs.2,70,000/- which according to the learned
counsel for the petitioner is without jurisdiction and in gross
violation of the provision under section 362 of Cr.P.C.
             Learned    counsel  for   the  opposite    party  Mr.
Chandrakanta Nayak on the other hand contended that the order
dated 23.05.2016 in granting stay operation of the judgment is
neither a judgment nor a final order disposing of a case and
therefore, section 362 of Cr.P.C. is not applicable. Learned
counsel for the opposite party further contended that since at
the time of admission of the appeal, the learned Appellate Court
had overlooked the ratio decided in the cases of Stanny Felix
Pinto (supra), Dilip S. Dahanukar (supra) and Bikram Kumar
Jena (supra) and granted blanket stay order of the operation of
the Trial Court judgment, when the judgments were pointed out
to the learned Appellate Court, he was quite justified in passing

                                 5
the impugned order and therefore, it cannot be said that there is
any illegality or impropriety in passing the impugned order so as
to interfere with the same invoking revisional jurisdiction and
therefore, the revision petition being devoid of merits should be
dismissed.
             At this stage, the learned counsel for the petitioner
produced the certified copy of the order dated 06.10.2016
passed by the learned Appellate Court which indicates that the
stay order dated 23.05.2016 was vacated and the date was fixed
for hearing on the question of appeal. The said order of vacation
of stay has not been challenged by the learned counsel for the
petitioner in this revision.
             In view of section 362 of Cr.P.C., once in a criminal
case, the Court passes a judgment or final order disposing of the
case, the Court cannot alter or review the same unless it is
otherwise provided in the Cr.P.C. or by any other law for the
time being in force. The provision however will not affect the
power of the Court to correct clerical or arithmetical errors. The
Court becomes functus officio as soon as the judgment or final
order disposing of a case is signed. The term “judgment” has not
been defined in the Code but it means the judicial determination
or a decision arrived at after due consideration of the evidence

                                  6
and all the arguments. A judgment in a trial of a criminal case
terminates the proceeding before a Court either in conviction or
acquittal of the accused. The provision has been made to
preserve the sanctity of a “judgment” or “final order disposing of
a case” and to prevent either of the parties the approach the
same Court again and again to change the judgment either by
altering or reviewing it or to disturb the finality of the proceeding
in the case before the said Court. Even the High Court has got
no power to alter or review a judgment passed in a criminal case
in exercise of its power under section 482 of Cr.P.C. However,
the order passed in a miscellaneous case that to ignoring the
settled position of law as enunciated by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court or this Court cannot came within “judgment” or “final
order disposing of the case” for application of the bar under
section 362 of Cr.P.C. though it may be a final order disposing of
such miscellaneous case.
             On perusal of the impugned order dated 11.08.2016
and considering the ratio laid down in the cases of Stanny Felix
Pinto (supra), Dilip S. Dahanukar (supra) and Bikram Kumar
Jena (supra), I am of the view that the learned Appellate Court
has not committed any illegality in directing the petitioner to
deposit a sum of Rs.2,70,000/- (rupees two lakhs seventy

                                7
thousand) which is a reasonable amount i.e. 10% of the
awarded compensation amount. Law is well settled that it the
Court is convinced that compensation should be paid, then
quantum of compensation is to be determined by taking into
consideration the nature of the crime, the injury suffered and the
capacity of the convict to pay compensation but it should be
reasonable and not arbitrary. It is also well settled that the Court
can impose default sentence in case           of non-payment of
compensation.
             Therefore, without interfering with the impugned
order, I direct that in the event the petitioner deposits the
aforesaid amount of Rs.2,70,000/- (rupees two lakhs seventy
thousand) by end of January 2017 from today, the realization of
balance amount of the awarded compensation amount shall
remain stayed till disposal of the appeal and the appeal shall be
heard on merit and disposed of in accordance with law by end of
February 2017. The deposit of such amount by the petitioner
shall be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the
parties in the appeal and the opposite party shall not be allowed
to withdraw such amount during pendency of the appeal. If the
aforesaid amount is not deposited by end of January 2017 either
willfully or due to absence of means, the Appellate Court can

                                      8
take appropriate steps against the petitioner but cannot dismiss
the appeal on that ground as it is a constitutional and statutory
right and by denying such right to the petitioner would violate
his    fundamental         right enshrined under Article 21  of the
Constitution of India and such right can neither be interfered
with or impaired, nor it can be subjected to any condition.
                 With the aforesaid observation and direction, the
Criminal Revision is disposed of.
                                                     …………………………
