                            W.P.(C) No. 13416 of 2012
                 Present :  Mr S.K. Das, Advocate for the petitioners.
                            Mr R.K. Mohapatra, Govt. Advocate.
10. 17.12.2013              This petition seeks quashing of tender call notice
               dated 23.07.2012 (Annexure-4) and a direction to consider
               tenders submitted by the petitioners and to award works
               under the earlier NIT dated 21.01.2012 (Annexure-1).
                            The case of the petitioners is that they are
               P.W.D. contractors and executing various type of works and
               gave their bids pursuant to the tender call notice dated
               21.01.2012 issued by the Superintending Engineer, Rural
               Works Circle, Bhawanipatna for construction of roads and
               C.D. works under P.M.G.S.Y. (Prime Minister Gramya Sadak
               Yojana) Scheme in packages including maintenance for five
               years. The cost fixed for different type of works was rupees
               50 lakhs to 8 crores. The time for completion of the work was
               fixed to be 12 calendar months for work above 1 crore, and 9
               calendar months for work below 1 crore. The petitioners
               submitted tender papers with bank draft worth Rs.10,400/-
               for 42 nos. of works floated in the tender notice under R.W.
               Division, Bhawanipatna. Technical bids were opened on
               12.03.2012 and final bids were to be opened on 17.03.2012,
               but the matter was not finalized. Thereafter the impugned
               tender notice was issued which was being politically
               motivated     to     favour     contractors       sponsored and
               recommended by some M.L.As. and Ministers without
               canceling the first tender notice. The petitioners were single
               tenderers and qualified in all the tenders. In similar

                      -2-
circumstances, in other divisions the works have been
allotted.
            Considering the contention raised on behalf of the
petitioners, this Court vide order dated 31.07.2012 stayed
operation of the Tender Notice dated 23.07.2012. Thus, for
last one and half years, the work has not proceeded.
            Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of opp.
party nos.1 and 3 by the Executive Engineer, Rural Works
Division, Dharamgarh stating that there was allegation of
tender fixing and the Superintendent of Police, Vigilance,
Koraput Division, informed the Superintending Engineer
that many contractors could not submit tenders on account
of threats as a result of which only single tenders were
submitted. Considering the said report, the Government in
Rural Development Department decided to cancel the above
single tender. The petitioners were free to participate in the
fresh tender process.
            Considering the counter affidavit, on 24.09.2013,
this Court observed that though situation appeared to be
similar in three divisions of Bhawanipatna Circle, it was not
clear as to why only in one division tender process was
cancelled. Accordingly, direction was issued to file a further
affidavit. Further affidavit has been filed on 26.11.2013
explaining the position as follows:
          “That the reasons for taking a decision to cancel
     the tenders of Rural Works Division, Bhawanipatna
     excepting the other two divisions was on the basis of
     the advice of Superintendent of Police, Vigilance. It is
     humbly submitted that on receipt of letter of the
     Superintendent      of    Police,    Vigilance,     the
     Superintending Engineer, R.W. Circle, Bhawanipatna

                       -3-
     had drawn the attention of the Chief Engineer, R.W.
     – I, Odisha, Bhubaneswar vide letter No.174 dated
     23.03.2012 filed to the earlier counter affidavit as
     Annexure-B/1. The Chief Engineer, Rural Works-I as
     per letter no.6169 dated 04.04.2012 informed the
     Superintending Engineer, R.W. Circle, Bhawanipatna
     about receipt of clearance from the Ministry of Rural
     Development, Govt. of India for execution of the
     projects under IAP-II. It has also been instructed to
     process the tender and award the works within the
     competency of Superintending Engineer observing
     the prevailing PMGSY guidelines except for the works
     tender under Rural Works Division, Bhawanipatna,
     in view of allegation of tender fixing. The Chief
     Engineer,     R.W.-I, Odisha vide office letter no.9960
     dated 05.06.2012 informed the Superintending
     Engineer, R.W. Circle, Bhawanipatna that the matter
     was discussed before the Hon’ble Minister, Rural
     Development and Law in presence of the Principal
     Secretary to Government in R.D. Department and the
     Chief Engineer, R.W.-I on 22.05.2012 and it was
     decided to process all packages under the R.W.
     Circle, Bhawanipatna including negotiations with
     bidders and to submit the same to the higher
     authority whenever necessary except for tenders
     pertaining to Rural Works Division, Bhawanipatna.
     The Superintending Engineer was also instructed not
     to finalise the tenders till clearance on the matter is
     received from the Government……..”
            We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
            Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that
the petitioners may not have a right to insist that the tender
process to be proceeded with, the decision of the opposite
parties must be fair. There is no material to substantiate the
report of the Superintendent of Police, Vigilance that all the
contractors could not participate. The Chief Engineer in his
report to the Principal Secretary dated 4.5.2012 (Annexure-
5) clearly stated that the report of the Superintendent of
Police Vigilance was not substantiated and the said stand of

                     -4-
the Chief Engineer ought to have been accepted by the
Government. There is no qualitative difference in one
division where the tender process was cancelled and the
other two divisions where the tender process was proceeded
with.
           Learned Govt. Advocate justifies the stand of the
opp. parties. It is pointed out that no individual has been
made party in support of allegations of mala fide. Casual
averment that direction was to benefit persons supported by
M.L.As. and Misters cannot be accepted. The decision to
cancel the tender process was bona fide in view of report that
there were no competitive bids.
           On due consideration, we are of the view that no
interference is called for by this Court in absence of any
material to show favouritism or lack of bona fides. In
absence thereof, this Court cannot substitute its own
decision in place of decision of the administrative authority.
The executive has the freedom of contract and free play in
joints is essential for decision making, subject to decision
being bona fide and rational and not against public interest.
General rule in such matter is judicial restraint in absence of
manifest arbitrariness of favouritism. Reference in this
context may be made to decision of the Supreme Court in
Siemens Public Communication Networks Private Limited and
another v. Union of India and others, (2008) 16 SCC 215.
           We are unable to accept the submission that
merely because the competent authority has taken a
decision not to go ahead with the tender, the same is mala

                         -5-
    fide or irrational. Mere fact that there was difference in
    perceptions of the Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and
    the Chief Engineer did not compel the Government to reject
    the view of the Superintendent of Police, Vigilance.
               This Court is not, thus, inclined to interfere with
    the decision to cancel the tender process merely on the
    ground that different view could be taken in the matter. As
    already observed, execution of public projects cannot be
    obstructed unless clear case of illegality or mala fide is made
    out. There is no case of personal mala fides. No individual
    M.L.A. or Minister has been impleaded who allegedly
    influenced the decision making. Cancellation of process does
    not    in  any    manner    preclude   the     petitioners  from
    participating in the fresh tender process. The fact that at
    some other places, the process has not been cancelled can
    also not be a ground to direct that the work be awarded to
    the petitioners and fresh tender process should not be
    initiated.
               In these circumstances, no ground has been made
    out to interfere.
               The petition is dismissed.
