           PRESENT:
                 THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE INDRAJIT MAHANTY.
                           Date of judgment: 18.06.2014
I. Mahanty, J.      This matter referred to this Bench in view of a difference
           expressed by Hon’ble Shri Justice P.K. Tripathy (the then was) and
           Hon’ble Shri Justice P. Mohanty. Whereas Hon’ble Shri Justice P.K.
           Tripathy not finding any merit in the writ petition, had directed its

                                   2
dismissal, Hon’ble Shri Justice P. Mohanty, on the other hand, had
directed the writ petition be allowed.
2.        The essential facts of this case briefly noted are that the writ
petitioner-Sebati Behera and opposite party No.1-Subasi Nayak had
both contested for the post of Sarpanch of Kalada Grama Panchayat
under Parjang P.S. in the district of Dhenkanal. The said post of
Sarpanch was reserved for candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes.
Necessary    nominations    was    filed   along  with  necessary   caste
certificates  and   the   Election    Officer  had  been   accepted   the
nominations after scrutiny. Both the candidates contested the said
election and the petitioner ultimately succeeded in the election and
was declared elected.
3.        It is important to note herein that the petitioner-Sebati
Behera had been granted a caste certificate in her favour describing
her sub-caste is ‘Dewar’ (Kaibarta), copy of which is available at
Annexure-3.
4.        It appears that opposite party No.1-Subasi Nayak, the
defeated candidate filed election dispute in the court of Civil Judge
(Jr. Division), Kamakhyanagar in Election Misc. Case No.8 of 2002
challenging the election of the petitioner essentially on the ground
that “at the time of filing of nomination, the petitioner was not a
member of the Scheduled Caste”. This contention was sought to be

                                  3
substantiated by placing reliance on the Constitution (Scheduled
Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, which came into force
on 18.12.2002 and as a consequence of such amendment, the sub-
caste ‘Kaibarta’ was clarified/declared and included as a Scheduled
Caste in Entry No.24 of the Act.
5.        The learned Civil Judge (Jr. Division), Kamakhyanagar
allowed the election dispute filed by opposite party No.1 holding that
the inclusion of ‘Kaibarta’ as a Scheduled Caste was made only on
18.12.2002 and consequently was prospective in nature and the
petitioner had been erroneously declared as Scheduled Caste by the
Tahasildar, Parjang in its certificate granted on 17.01.2002 on the
basis of which the petitioner had contested the election held on
21.02.2002 for the post of Sarpanch of Kalada Grama Panchayat. The
aforesaid view was reiterated and accepted by the Adhoc Additional
District Judge, Kamakhyanagar in Appeal and, accordingly, F.A.O.
No.5 of 2003/F.A.O. No.2 of 2004 filed by the petitioner also came to
be dismissed. Hence, the present writ petition.
6.        I have had the privilege of going through the judgments
rendered by the Hon’ble Shri Justice P.K. Tripathy as well as Hon’ble
Shri Justice P. Mohanty. The essential differences between the two
judgments appears to be that whereas Justice Tripathy referred to
the judgment of the directives issued by this Court in the case of

                                 4
Narayan Behera v. State of Orissa through Secretary, Tribal &
Welfare Department and others, 49 (1980) C.L.T. 47 as well as the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Zile Singh v.
State of Haryana and others, 2004 A.I.R. S.C.W. 5842 his Lordship
came to conclude that it cannot be said that inclusion of three castes
in Sl. No.24 is either declaratory or explanatory with retrospective
effect and consequently came to conclude that the said amendment
was correctly treated as “prospective” by the learned trial judge as
well as the lower appellate court, Hon’ble Shri Justice P. Mohanty, on
the other hand, placing reliance on the aforesaid two judgments of
this Court as well as the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
Narayan Behera (supra) and in the case of Zile Singh (supra)
respectively and also placed reliance in the case of State of
Maharashtra v. Milind Katware, 2000 AIR SCW 4303 as well as
various other judgments of the Hon’ble Apex Court concluded that, a
bare reading of the aforesaid judgments the mere absence of use of
the word ‘declaration’ in an Act explaining what was the law before
may not appear to be a declaratory Act, but if the Court finds an Act
as declaratory or explanatory, it has to be construed as retrospective
since the legislative power to enact law includes the power to declare
what was the previous law, and when such a declaratory Act is
passed, invariably it has been held to be retrospective.

                                 5
7.        With greatest respect to the Hon’ble Judges and after
perusing the same, I am in respectful agreement with the views
expressed by Hon’ble Shri Justice P. Mohanty and, in particular, the
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Zile Singh
(supra) where it has been held that, the presumption against
retrospective operation is not applicable to “declaratory statute” and
further that where a statute is passed for the purpose of supplying an
obvious omission in a former statute or to ‘explain’ a former statute,
the subsequent statute has relation back to the time when the prior
Act was passed. The rule against retrospectivity is inapplicable to
such legislations as are “explanatory and declaratory” in nature. In
the case at hand, this Court in the case of Narayan Behera (supra)
had already directed ‘Kaibarta’ to be issued with caste certificates
having held the same to be synonymous with ‘Dhibara’ and since
‘Kaibarta’ has come to be included by way of the Constitution
(Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002 dated
18.12.2002, yet ever since the date of the judgment of this Court in
the case of Narayan Behera (supra) came delivered on 05.11.1979,
till the date of the Constitutional Amendment, the judgment of
Narayan Behera was the law on the subject and the Tahasildar,
Parjang, having acted in terms of the direction of this Court in the
case of Narayan Behera (supra) (though at the time prior to the

                                 6
Constitutional Amendment), the certificate issued by him in favour of
the petitioner was valid and could not have been declared void
without any challenge thereto and consequently, for the reason noted
herein above, this Court record its opinion and agrees with the views
render by the Hon’ble Shri Justice P. Mohanty.
           Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed in terms of the
aforesaid judgment.
                                               …………………….
                                                 I.Mahanty,J.
