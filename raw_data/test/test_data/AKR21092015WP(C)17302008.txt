                  HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                               W.P.(C) No.1730 of 2008
    In the matter of an application under Article 227 of the Constitution of
    India.
                                       -------------
    Rajakishore Biswal                             ….                     Petitioner
                                         Versus
    Mohan Charan Biswal and another                 ….            Opposite parties
                        For Petitioner             --   Mr.B.K.Bhuyan
                                                        Advocate
                        For Opposite parties       --   Mr.M.R.Satpathy
                                                        Advocate
    PRESENT:
                    THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
                           Date of Hearing & Judgment 21.9.2015
Dr.A.K.Rath, J. Aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated 22.1.2008
    passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr.Division), Jagatsinghpur in T.S.No.77
    of 2002, the instant petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of
    India. By the said order, the learned trial court rejected the application of
    the petitioner under Order 18 Rule 3 of C.P.C. to adduce rebuttal evidence.
    2.           To appreciate the case, it is not necessary to delineate the entire
    facts of the case. Suffice to say that the petitioner as plaintiff filed a suit for
    permanent injunction along with other consequential reliefs in the court of
    the learned Civil Judge (Sr.Division), Jagatsinghpur, which is registered as
    T.S.No.77 of 2202. Pursuant to issuance of summons, the defendants

                                         2
entered appearance and filed written statement along with counter claim
praying inter alia for partition of the suit schedule land. The plaintiff filed
written statement of the counter claim. In course of hearing, he was
examined and cross-examined as P.W.1. On 10.1.2008 an application was
filed on behalf of the plaintiff under Order 18 Rule 3 C.P.C. praying therein
to permit him to adduce rebuttal evidence. The defendants have filed
objection to the said petition. It is stated that after closure of the evidence of
the plaintiff, the petition filed by him is not maintainable. The learned trial
court came to hold that the plaintiff could have filed petition before
beginning of his evidence. So at this stage his option to adduce further
evidence to reply the questions of the defendants is not maintainable. Such
an option is available before beginning of the evidence of the plaintiff at
least, in course of his evidence. But after closure of the evidence of the
plaintiff, he is not allowed to adduce evidence when the evidence of the
defendants side has started. Having held so, the learned trial court rejected
application.
3.            Heard Mr.Bhuyan, learned counsel for the petitioner and
Mr.Satpathy, learned counsel for the opposite parties.
4.            Mr.Bhuyan, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
learned trial court has committed a manifest illegality and impropriety in
holding that after closure of evidence of plaintiff, he cannot be allowed to
adduce rebuttal evidence. Drawing attention of this Court to the order dated
18.12.2007, vide Annexure-6, he submits that the plaintiff was examined
and cross examined at length. A petition was filed on 18.12.2007 for time to
adduce further evidence. The same was allowed and the suit was posted to
10.1.2008 for further evidence. On 10.1.2008 a petition was filed on behalf
of the plaintiff under Order 18 Rule 3 C.P.C. supported by affidavit praying
to permit him to adduce rebuttal evidence. Thus, before hearing of the
plaintiff was closed, the application for rebuttal evidence was filed. He cited

                                          3
decisions of this Court in the case of Sri Nilakantha Rath Vrs. Sri Natha
Maharana, 72(1991) C.L.T. 509 and Smt.Prativa Kar Vrs. Sri Ananda
Chandra Das, 109 (2010) CLT 507.
5.           Per contra, Mr.Sathpathy, learned counsel for the opposite
parties supports the order passed by the learned trial court.
6.           Order 18 Rule 3 C.P.C., which is the hub of the issue, is quoted
hereunder:-
                    “3.Evidence where several issues.- Where there are
             several issues, the burden of proving some of which lies on the
             other party, the party beginning may, at his option, either
             produce his evidence on those issues or reserve it by way of
             answer to the evidence produced by the other party; and, in the
             latter case, the party beginning may produce evidence on those
             issues after the other party has produced all his evidence, and
             the other party may then reply specially on the evidence so
             produce by the party beginning; but the party beginning will
             then be entitled to reply generally on the whole case.”
7.           On an interpretation of the said Rule, a Bench of this Court in
the case of Sri Nilakantha Rath (supra) held that for its application the first
condition to be satisfied is that there must be several issues involved in the
suit. The issues referred to in the said provision obviously mean issues of
fact, because evidence is required to be led only on issues. Therefore, in
order to attract the provision, there must be more than one issue of fact. It
was further held that although the provision does not prescribe any
particular stage at which the option should be exercised, it is only fair and
reasonable that the same should be exercised before the party (exercising
the option) begins his evidence and in no case after evidence from the other
side has began. That is because, the other party must know clearly before
he begins his evidence that the first party has actually not finished
adducing his entire evidence in the suit. The same view was taken in the
case of Smt. Prativa Kar (supra) ( emphasis laid).

                                             4
8.                On 18.12.2007, the plaintiff was cross-examined at length and
an application was also filed by the plaintiff for time to adduce further
evidence. The same was allowed and the suit was posted to 10.1.2008. On
10.1.2008, the plaintiff filed an application under Order 18 Rule 3 C.P.C.
praying therein to permit him to adduce rebuttal evidence. Thus, before the
defendants began their evidence, the plaintiff filed application. There are
several issues in the suit. Burden lies on the defendants to proof some of
the issues. In view of the same, the plaintiff has exercised option to adduce
rebuttal evidence before defendants began.
9.                In view of the same, the learned trial court has committed a
patent error of law in rejecting the application of the plaintiff. The order
dated      22.1.2008        passed by    the   learned  Civil Judge  (Sr.Division),
Jagatsinghpur in T.S.No.77 of 2002 is quashed. The learned trial court shall
allow the plaintiff to adduce rebuttal evidence.
                  Accordingly, the petition is allowed.
                                                              ………………………..
                                                               Dr.A.K.Rath, J.
Orissa High Court, Cuttack.
