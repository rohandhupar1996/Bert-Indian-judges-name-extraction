                          JUDGMENT
PRESENT:
          THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
 Date of hearing: 17.04.2018        Date of judgment: 23.04.2018
DR.A.K.RATH, J. This is a plaintiff’s appeal against confirming
judgment. The suit was for declaration that the plaintiff’s date of birth
is 22.07.1942.
02.          The case of the plaintiff was that he was born on
20.07.1942. He was functioning as Inspector of Vigilance. The entry

                                     2
of his date of birth as 01.01.1938 in the school records and service
register is wrong.   He had no occasion to know the correct date of
birth.    On 25.12.1994, his mother informed him that he was 54
years.    He enquired into the actual state of affairs and could know
that his actual date of birth is 20.07.1942, not 01.01.1938. He filed a
representation. With this factual scenario, he instituted the suit
seeking the reliefs mentioned supra.
03.          The defendant no.1 filed a written statement stating inter
alia that the plaintiff made a representation on 06.01.1995 for
correction   of  his date    of  birth. After  due    consideration,  the
representation was rejected. The order was communicated to the
plaintiff on 16.05.1995. The date of birth of the plaintiff was recorded
as 01.01.1938 in his service book as per matriculation certificate
issued by the Board of Secondary Education under Rule 65 of the
Orissa General Financial Rules. Once a date of birth is recorded in the
service book, the same cannot be altered. The plaintiff being an
educated man and officer of the Police Department for a long period,
must have known his correct date of birth.         He could have made
attempts earlier for correction of his date of birth in his service book.
Defendant no.2 also filed a written statement taking a similar stand.
04.          Stemming on the pleadings of the parties, learned trial
court struck three issues. To substantiate the case, the plaintiff had
examined three witnesses and on his behalf three documents had

                                     3
been exhibited. Neither any witness had been examined by the
defendants nor any documentary evidence had been exhibited.
Learned trial court dismissed the suit with a finding that the suit is
not maintainable.     Felt aggrieved, the plaintiff filed T.A. No. 09 of
1995 before the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Aska. Learned
appellate held that the suit is maintainable. On a threadbare analysis
of the evidence on record as well as pleadings, it came to hold that
the date of birth of the plaintiff is 01.01.1938. Held so, it dismissed
the appeal.
05.          The   second   appeal    was   admitted    on the  following
substantial questions of law:-
           “Whether the finding of the appellate court is that
           the suit is barred by limitation is correct ?”
06.          Heard Mr. Hemanta Kumar Behera, learned counsel on
behalf of Mr. S.D. Das, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant and
Mr.R.P. Mohapatra, learned Additional Government Advocate along
with Mr. S. Mishra, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the
respondent nos.1 and 2. None appeared for the respondent no.3.
07.          Mr. Behera, learned counsel for the appellant submitted
that under Article 58 of the Limitation Act, the period of limitation is
three years, to obtain any other declaration when the right to sue
first accrues. The right to sue accrued on 25.12.1994, when the
mother of the plaintiff informed him the correct date of birth. The

                                      4
finding of the learned appellate court is that the suit is barred by
limitation is perverse.
08.           Per    contra,    Mr.    Mohapatra,     learned     Additional
Government Advocate submitted that the plaintiff instituted the suit
at the fag end of his career. The cause of action stated in the plaint
is a myth. The suit is barred by limitation.
09.           Article 58 of the Limitation Act provides to obtain any
other declaration. The period of limitation is three years, when the
right to sue first accrues. The right to sue first accrued to the plaintiff
when he received the H.S.C. certificate.
10.           In Khatri Hotels Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. V. Union of India & Anr.
(2011) 9 SCC 126, the apex Court held:
              “30.While enacting Article 58 of the 1963 Act, the
             legislature has designedly made a departure from
             the language of Article 120 of the 1908 Act. The
             word “first” has been used between the words
             “sue” and “accrued”. This would mean that if a suit
             is based on multiple causes of action, the period of
             limitation will begin to run from the date when the
             right to sue first accrues. To put it differently,
             successive violation of the right will not give rise to
             fresh cause and the suit will be liable to be
             dismissed if it is beyond the period of limitation
             counted from the day when the right to sue first
             accrued.”
11.           The apex Court in the case of Board of Trustees of Port of
Kandla vs. Hargovind Jasraj and another, 2013 (3) SSC 182 held
thus:-
             “22. The expression right to sue has not been
             defined. But the same has on numerous occasions
             fallen for interpretation before the Courts. In State

                                       5
              of Punjab & Ors. V. Gurdev Singh (1991) 4 SCC 1,
              the expression was explained as under :
                “6………. The words “right to sue” ordinarily mean
              the right to seek relief by means of legal
              proceedings. Generally, the right to sue accrues
              only when the cause of action arises, that is, the
              right to prosecute to obtain relief by legal means.
              The suit must be instituted when the right
              asserted in the suit is infringed or when there is a
              clear and unequivocal threat to infringe that right
              by the defendant against whom the suit is
              instituted.”
12.            Rule 65 of the Orissa General Financial Rules (Vol.1)
provides that every person on entering Government service shall
declare his/her date of birth which shall not differ from any such
declaration expressed or implied for any public purpose before
entering service. The date of birth shall be supported by documentary
evidence such as Matriculation Certificate, Municipal Birth Certificate
and entered in his/her service record. No alternation of the date of
birth of Government servant shall be made except in case of clerical
error without prior approval of the State Government. An application
for effecting a change in the date of birth shall be summarily rejected
if (a) filled after five years of entry into Government service, or; (b)
the change would so lower the applicants age that he/she would have
been ineligible to appear in any of the academic or recruitment
Examinations in which he/she had appeared or for consideration for
appointment to any service or post under the Government.

                                         6
13.          The plaintiff instituted the suit at the fag end of his
service career. Filing of successive representations does not save
limitation.
14.          In Executive Engineer, Bhadrak (R&B) Division, Orissa
and others     vs. Rangadhar         Mallik,    1993    Suppl. (1)       SCC  763
interpreting Rule 65 of the Orissa General Financial Rules, the apex
Court held that when an application for correction of the date of birth
was made near about the time of superannuation it shall not be
corrected. The same view was echoed in the case of State of Tamil
Nadu vs. T.V. Venugopalan, (1994) 6 SCC 302. The apex Court held
thus:
                 “………..the inordinate delay in making the application
                 is itself a ground for rejecting the correction of date of
                 birth. The government servant having declared his
                 date of birth as entered in the service register to be
                 correct, would not be permitted at the fag end of his
                 service career to raise a dispute as regards the
                 correctness of the entries in the service register. It is
                 common         phenomenon         that    just      before
                 superannuation, an application would be made to the
                 Tribunal or court just to gain time to continue in
                 service and the Tribunal or courts are unfortunately
                 unduly liberal in entertaining and allowing the
                 government employees or public employees to remain
                 in office, which is adding an impetus to resort to the
                 fabrication of the record and place reliance thereon
                 and seek the authority to correct it.”
15.          One aspect of the matter cannot be brushed aside. After
entering into the service, the Service Book of the plaintiff was
opened, wherein his date of birth was recorded. He must have
countersigned to the same. Neither the matriculation certificate nor
the   service  book     had    been     exhibited.     The   same      have  been

                                          7
purposefully withheld.          The plaintiff was functioning as Inspector of
Vigilance. In the H.S.C. certificate as well as in the service book, the
date of birth of the plaintiff was recorded as 01.01.1938. The plaintiff
rose from deep slumber and instituted the suit at the fag end of his
service. Filing of the representation does not save limitation. As held
by the apex Court in Executive Engineer (supra), when an application
for correction of the date of birth was made near about the time of
superannuation, it shall not be corrected. When the service book of
the plaintiff was opened, it must have countersigned to the same.
The first cause of action accrued when the H.S.C. certificate was
issued.
16.              By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the
plaintiff has passed matriculation examination prior to three years of
institution of the suit. The learned appellate court is quite justified in
holding, inter alia, that the suit is barred by limitation. The
substantial question of law is answered accordingly.
17.              Resultantly, the appeal fails and is dismissed. There shall
be no order as to costs.
                                                    …..……………………..
