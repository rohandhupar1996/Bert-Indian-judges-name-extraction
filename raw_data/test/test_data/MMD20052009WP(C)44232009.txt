                               Date of Judgment:          20.05.2009
                                   ------------------------------------
       PRESENT :
                      THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M.M. DAS
M. M. Das, J.        As common questions of fact and law arise in all the writ
       petitions, they were heard together on the question of law and the
       learned counsel for the respective petitioners also individually raised
       contentions in support of the facts of the respective cases,               and are
       disposed of by this common judgment.
       2.            All the petitioners in the aforesaid writ petitions have called
       in question the marks awarded to them by the opp. parties while
       evaluating   their  answer      scripts    in   the   P.G.    (Medical)   Entrance
       Examination, 2009. The petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos. 3351, 3352, 4423,

                                     2
5473 and 6045 of 2009 appeared in the said examination as in-service
candidates and the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 6062 of 2009 appeared in
the said examination as direct candidate to take admission into the P.G.
(Medical) Course.
3.            A counter affidavit has been filed by the Convenor, P.G.
(Medical) Selection Committee, 2009-cum-Principal, M.K.C.G. Medical
College, Berhampur in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009, which has been
adopted in other writ petitions.
4.            From    the  procedure   adopted    in   the  said   Entrance
Examination, it appears that a Question Answer Booklet was given to
each of the candidates consisting of 300 questions. Four answers were
suggested for each of the questions as A, B, C and D, and empty boxes
were printed by the side of each of the questions wherein the candidates
were to write the correct answer out of the suggested answers, i.e. they
were to write the alphabet A or B or C or D therein representing the
correct answer according to them. Each question correctly answered was
to be valued with 4 marks and if any answer is found to be incorrect or
more than one response is given or the box is left blank, it would entail a
negative mark of one mark i.e. there would be a deduction of one mark
for each such answer.
5.            The moot question raised before this Court is as to whether
the Court is entitled to reassess the marks awarded to the candidates in
the entrance test and if so, under what circumstances, the writ Court
has jurisdiction to do so.    Since this is the common question of law
raised by the opp. parties, the said question is to be gone into in order to
find out as to whether the correctness of the answers given by the
petitioners can be examined by this Court or not. Similar question was
raised in the cases of Kanpur University and others –v- Samir Gupta

                                      3
and others, AIR 1983 SC 1230, Abhijit Sen and others –v- State of
Uttar Pradesh and others, (1984) 2 SCC 319, a batch of writ petitions
in the case of Priyadarshini Acharya and others –v- State of Orissa
and others, 1991 (1) OLR 514 and another batch of writ petitions in the
case of Raghunath Pradhan and others –v- State of Orissa and
others, 1992 (II) OLR 317.
6.            It is trite to mention that in Multiple Choice Test, the key
answer should be the correct or most appropriately correct answer and
the rest of the answers should either be wholly in correct or incorrect
though appear to be correct.
7.            In all the aforesaid cited cases, the Court while exercising
its plenary jurisdiction examined the specific answers claimed by the
petitioners therein in order to find out as to whether the said answers
given are most appropriately correct answers and as to whether the
suggested answers given by the Committee for evaluation, were wrong. It
is now a settled position of law that if the petitioners in a given case can
demonstratively show that the answers given by them in such type of
test are most appropriately correct answers and the answers suggested
in the key answer are incorrect, the writ Court can interfere in the matter
by issuing a direction to allot the marks to which such petitioners are
entitled to.
8.            This question is, therefore, answered in the affirmative that
the writ Court can examine as to whether the answer given by the
petitioners is most appropriately correct answer and the key answer
suggested is incorrect, if the same is exemplified        by disclosing the
materials.
9.            As a matter of fact, in the case of Raghunath Pradhan and
others (supra), this Court referring to all the earlier decisions including

                                      4
the decisions in the case of Kanpur University (supra) and Priyadarshini
Acharya (supra) while meeting the contentions of the opp. parties that
the Court being not an expert in technical matters should not tinker with
the view of the examiners of the Examining Body, held that such
argument is attractive but it is not sound and where the method adopted
or decision taken is clearly unreasonable, perverse and demonstratively
wrong, the Court has to act and should not shun to interfere because the
key answer has been suggested by experts or the examining body. In the
case of Priyadarshini Acharya (supra), this Court in order to find out the
correctness of the answers given by the examinees and the key answers
suggested, also referred to various text books in respect of which all the
questions which were subject of the examination in the said case, in
order to find out as to whether the answers given by the candidates were
the most appropriately correct or not. As the petitioners in each case
were supplied with different sets of Question-Answer Booklets and have
called in question the correctness of evaluation of particular answers
given by them referring to the question papers in their respective
Question Answer Booklets, it would be appropriate to deal with each of
the writ petitions separately for coming to a conclusion as to whether the
respective petitioners will be entitled to marks in respect of such
questions as claimed by them to have been correctly answered.
10.            The petitioner, Dr. Goutam Patnaik, in the aforesaid writ
petition, being W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009 has claimed that the answers
given by him to the question nos. 129, 187, 225, 59, 84, 163 and 184 are
correct but he has been deprived of four marks each for the said
questions and also seven marks have been deducted by way of negative
marking for the answers given to the said questions by him. A counter
affidavit has been filed on behalf of the Convenor in this case.      The

                                     5
Convenor instead of meeting the specific allegations made by the
petitioner with regard to the aforesaid seven questions has taken a stand
relying on Clause – 10.17 of the P.G. Prospectus, 2009, which prescribes
as follows:
               “Any challenge or genuine complaint regarding the
        Questions and Choices asked in the Entrance Examination
        shall reach the Convenor by Registered Post only within 7
        (seven) days from the date of Entrance Examination. The
        said challenges/complaints will be scrutinized by an Expert
        Committee formed for this purpose by the Selection
        Committee to examine the genuineness of such challenges/
        complaints and their decision will be taken into
        consideration during the evaluation.”
Therefore, according to the Convenor, it is inappropriate to say that the
answers (four choices) are out dated and the petitioner would have
brought the allegations now made, before the Selection Committee
challenging the correctness of the Choice answers provided against a
particular question.
11.            It is needless to mention that there is no scope for the
candidate to raise a complaint regarding the Questions and Choices
asked in the Entrance Examination, since the Question Answer Booklet
is to be returned by the candidate after giving the answers and it is
humanly impossible for a candidate to remember 300 questions, set for
the Entrance Examination and the suggested answers numbering 1200
(4 for each question).    Hence, Clause- 10.17 of the P.G. Prospectus is
totally redundant and unworkable.         Such contention raised in the
counter affidavit by the Convenor is, therefore, unacceptable.
12.            Since the counter affidavit having been filed in W.P.(C) No.
5473 of 2009, it would be convenient to take up the said writ petition as
the first case.

                                      6
14.           In W.P.(C) No. 5473/2009
               The petitioner has claimed that he has answered question
nos. 129, 187, 225, 59, 84, 163 and 184 correctly, but he has not been
awarded marks for the seven questions totaling to 28 and 7 marks have
been deducted by way of negative mark.
               Question No. 129 is as follows:-
               “Abandoning of child is a crime, under section:
               A. 302 IPC
               B. 304 IPC
               C. 317 IPC
               D. 318 IPC
            Model Key Answer - D          Candidate’s answer – C”
               The petitioner mentioned “C” as the correct answer. Section
317 I.P.C. deals with abandonment of child under 12 years by parent or
person having care of it and is the most appropriately correct answer to
the above question. The model answer as produced by the opp. Parties
shows that section 318 I.P.C. was suggested as the correct answer for
which the petitioner has not been awarded with any mark and “1” mark
has been deducted by way of negative marking.
               Section 318 I.P.C. deals with concealment of birth by secret
disposal of dead body and does not relate to abandonment of child.
Therefore, section 318 I.P.C., which was mentioned as choice “D” cannot
be the correct answer.       Hence, the petitioner in question no. 129 is
entitled to “4” marks as well as one negative marking. Therefore, in toto,
he is entitled to “5” marks for the said question.
               “Question No. 187 is as follows:
               Plaster of Paris is:
               A.     Hemihydrated calcium sulphate.
               B.     Hydrated calcium carbonate.
               C.     Hemihydrated calcium phosphate.
               D.     Hemihydrated calcium gluconate.

                                      7
             Model Key Answer - C        Candidate’s Answer - A.”
               The petitioner gave “A” as the answer, but the answer
suggested by the opp. Parties in the model answer is “C”. In the
“Essential    Orthopaedics”      by   J.  Maheswari    ,  a  Specialists   in
Orthopaedics formerly working        in the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences at page 14 indicated plaster paris (Gypsum salt) is “CaSO4.1/2
H2O in dry form, which becomes CaSO4. 2H2 O on wetting.
               Answer “A” as suggested clearly states Hemihydrated. The
dictionary meaning of which is “half Hydrated” Calcium sulphate.
Therefore, it refers to plaster paris in dry form, which has half molecule
of water with calcium sulphate and the said answer “A” is the most
appropriately correct answer. The answer “C” as suggested is not plastic
paris. The petitioner having given ‘A’ as the correct answer, is , therefore,
entitled to “4” marks for the said question plus ‘1’ mark deducted as
negative mark . Therefore, in toto, he is entitled to “5” marks for the said
question.
               Question No. 225 is as follows:
         “ A sneeze from an untreated lepromatous patient may contain:
          A. >510 AFB
          B. > 1010 AFB
          C. > 105 AFB
           D. None of the above.
          Model Key answer - B                Candidate’s Answer – C”.
               The petitioner answered “C” as the correct answer, whereas
the model key answer suggested is “B”. In the Text Book of Dermatology
Vol.II, 3rd Edition, edited by R.G. Valia, Professor and Former Head,
Department of Dermatology, Venereology of L.T.M. College and L.T.M.G.
Hospital, Mumbai along with Ameet R. Valia, Honorary Dermatologist
have mentioned at page 2021 thereof as follows:-

                                         8
                Ulceration of the nasal mucosa is seen in untreated
lepromatous patients, providing an important route of exit of the
organisms. Nasal secretions from such patients may contain 106 to 108
organisms/ml.32. Thus, the answer given by the petitioner being correct,
the petitioner is entitled to 5 marks for this question.
                Question No. 59 is as follows:
                “Oesophagus enters into abdomen through-
               A.  Right crus of diaphragm.
               B.  Left crus of diaphragm.
               C.  Behind the Median arcuate ligament.
               D.  Muscular part of diaphragm.
                Model Key Answer       -A   Candidate’s Answer - D”
                The petitioner has answered “D” as the correct answer and
the model key answer given is        “A”.
                In the book Human Anatomy, Vol. II by B.D. Chaurasia,
the author under the heading openings in the Diaphragm mentions that
the Oesophageal opening lies is muscular part of the diaphragm. It is,
therefore, demonstratively shown that the answer given by the petitioner,
i.e., “D” is the correct answer and the answer suggested is not correct.
                Hence, the petitioner, therefore, as earlier stated including
the mark allotted to the question and the negative mark, is entitled to 5
marks for this question.
                Question No. 84 is as follows:
                “First Plasma Protein to appear in embryonic lift is:
                A.  Prothrombin
                B.  Globulin
                C.  Albumin
                D.  Fibrinogen.
                Model Key Answer - A       Candidate’s Answer - C”.
                  The petitioner has answered “C” as the correct answer and
the model key answer given is “A”.

                                       9
              In the book “Text Book of Medical Physiology by Indu
Khuran , Associate Professor , Department of Physiology, Post Graduate
Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, mentions as follows:-
                             “In embryo, the plasma proteins are
             synthesized by the mesenchymal cells through a
             process of secretion or dissolution of their substances.
             First, the albumin is produced and then the other
             proteins are synthesized …………….”
              It is, therefore, also demonstratively shown that the answer
given by the petitioner is correct and the model answer given is incorrect.
As in the above question likewise in this question, the petitioner is
entitled to 5 marks.
              Question No. 163 is as follows:
              “Formed visual hallucination are seen in lesion of.
              A.  Occipital lobe.
              B.   Temporal lobe.
              C.  Arcuate fasiculus.
              D.  Dentate nucleus.
              Model Key Answer - C.       Candidate’s Answer – A”.
              The petitioner gave the answer “A” as the correct answer
and the model key answer suggested is “C”.
              In Principles of Neurology, 8th Edition, Allam H. Ropper
M.D. Professor and Chairman of Neurology at Bostan and Robert
H.Brown, D.Phil. M.D. Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School
state that formed hallucinations are related to lesions of the occipital
lobe. Thus, it is demonstratively shown that the answer “A” is the correct
answer, which has been given by the petitioner and the model answer
suggested as ‘C’ is incorrect.
              Hence, the petitioner in this question is also entitled to 5
marks.

                                     10
              Lastly, question No.184 is as follows:
              “Most common cause of acute pancreatitis.
             A. Biliary.
             B. Alcoholic
             C. Dietary
             D. Idiopathic.
             Model Key Answer – A     Candidate’s Answer - B”.
              The petitioner gave “B” as the correct answer, but the model
answer suggested is “A”.
              In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine Vol. II Edition
by a group of U.S. Specialized doctors of United States have mentioned
as follows:
                  “ There are many causes of acute pancreatitis
             (Table 307-1), but the mechanisms by which these
             conditions trigger pancreatic inflammation have not
             been identified. Gallstones continue to be the leading
             cause of acute pancreatitis in most series (30-60%).
             Alcohol is the second most common cause………..”.
              Hence, the most appropriate answer to this question is “B”
and cannot be “A” as suggested. The petitioner having the answer as “B”
is entitled to five marks in this question as he having answered
correctly, the negative mark is also to be added.
              Thus, from the above discussions, it is evident that the
petitioner is entitled to 35 marks, in toto, more than       what he has
secured in the entrance test.
              The petitioner has subsequently filed an additional affidavit
claiming that the answers given in Question Nos. 45, 122, 196, 72, 161,
14 and 273 are the most appropriate choice and also the correct answers
but he has been deprived of 4 marks in each of the questions as well as
there has been 7 marks deducted by way of negative marks for the above

                                     11
said questions. On that ground, he claims that he should be awarded 35
marks more for the aforesaid questions.
             Question No. 45 is as follows:
             “All are features of ITP except
             A. Increase megakaryocytes in bone marrow.
             B. Thrombocytopenia
             C. Splenomegaly
             D. Giant Platelet”
             The petitioner answered the choice ‘D’ as the correct answer
but the model answer has been suggested as ‘C’.
             As per the reference from Harrison’s principles of Internal
Medicine (17th Edition) Page No. 374 (Table No. 60-2) shows one of the
cause of Splenomegaly is Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Again in de
Gruchy’s Clinical Haematology in Medical Practice (5th Edition) Page No.
379 shows increased megakryocyte and thrombocytopenia are common
features of ITP.   Whereas regarding giant platelet de Gruchy clearly
mention that abnormal small, big and atypical platelets are sometime
seen. Under the circumstances compare to all other option, Answer D is
least common and hence, the same is the most appropriately correct
answer. The petitioner, therefore, would be entitled to 5 marks for this
question.
             Question No. 122 is as follows:
             “The colour of postmortem abrasion is
             A. Red
             B. Yellow
             C. Black
             D. Reddish Brown”
             The petitioner suggested ‘D’ as the correct answer but the
model answer has been given as ‘B’.
             In Parikh’s Text book of medical Jurisprudence, Forensic
Medicine and Toxicology (6th Edition), the author has mentioned that “a
postmortem abrasion may appear dark brown or even black, and

                                       12
parchment like, as a result of the drying of the moist exposed surface,
when it may be mistake for burns.
                It is, therefore, clear that the suggested answer ‘B’ can
never be the correct answer and the answer given by the petitioner is the
most appropriately correct answer.      Hence, the petitioner is entitled to 5
marks for this question.
              Question No. 72 is as follows:
              “Rhabdomyolysis is associated with
              A.   Haemorrhagic shock
              B.   Traumatic shock
              C.   Septic shock
              D.   Anaphylactic shock”
              The petitioner suggested ‘C’ as the correct answer but the
model answer has been given as ‘B’.
              In Harrison’s Internal Medicine (17th Edition), Volume I, the
author state at page-801 that acute rhabdomyolysis predictably occurs
with clostridial and streptococcal myositis but may also be associated
with influenza virus, echovirus, coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and
Legionella infections. In Vol. II of the said book at page-1698, the author
states that a third pathogenesis may be represented by severe sepsis due
to superantigen-producing Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus
pyogenes, since the T cell activation induced by those toxins produces a
cytokine profile that differs substantially from that elicited by gram-
negative bacterial infection.
              It is, thus, demonstratively shown that the answer ‘C’ i.e.
Septic shock is the most appropriately correct answer to the above
question and, therefore, the petitioner is entitled to 5 marks for the said
question.

                                      13
              Question No. 196 is as follows:
              “All are true about Giant Cell Tumour of Bone except:
                     A.  Occurs in epiphysis
                     B.  Multiple lesion never occur
                     C.  Soap bubble appearance on X-Ray
                     D.  Pathological fracture can occur.
                     Key Answer – B        Candidate’s Answer – D”
               The petitioner answered “D” as the correct answer and the
key answer was suggested as “B”.
               In an extract of the Book “Apley’s System of Orthopaedics
and Fractures (8th Edition), a group of Doctors, namely, Louis Solomon,
Emeritus Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Bristol, David
Warwick, Former Lecture in Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Bristol,
Selvadurai Nayagam, Royal Liverpool Children’s Hospital and Royal
Liverpool University Hospital, it is stated that in Giant-Cell Tumour of
bone multiple lesions occur but rarely and pathological fracture occurs
in 10-15% of cases, the author writes that in Giant Cell Tumour,         a
history of trauma is not uncommon and pathological fracture occurs in
10-15% of cases. Hence, the given answer by the petitioner, i.e., “D”,
cannot be the correct answer. The petitioner is, thus, not entitled to any
mark for this question.
              Question No. 161 is as follows:
                “Which neurotransmitter is responsible for suicide
       behaviour.
                     A. Dopamine
                     B. GABA
                     C. Serotonin
                     D. Histamine
                     Key Answer – C      Candidate’s Answer – C”.
               The petitioner gave the answer “A” as the correct answer,
whereas the key answer given was “C”.

                                    14
               The petitioner has referred to a portion of Harrison’s
Principles  of    Internal  Medicine   which    has   not    been   shown
demonstratively that the answer given by the petitioner is correct and the
key answer suggested is wrong. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled
to any mark for this question.
                 Question No. 14 is as follows:
              “The drug approved for use in Premature labor is:
                     A. Salbutamol
                     B. Terbutaline
                     C. Ritodrine
                     D. Isoxuprine
                     Key Answer - C     Candidate’s Answer - D”
             The petitioner gave the answer “D” as the correct answer
but the Key answer has been given as “C”. A reference is made to a Text
Book of Obstetrics by D.C. Dutta (6th Edition), wherein, in Chapter
“Preterm Labour”, which is synonym to Preterm Labour under the
heading “Management of Preterm Labour”. The author writes “the
management includes: (1) to prevent preterm onset of labour, if possible,
(2) to arrest preterm labour, if not contraindicated       (3) appropriate
management of labour (4) effective neonatal care. The author has further
mentioned that the drugs which can be used for a short period as
terbutaline, ritodrine and isoxsuprine. Thus, except the suggested
answer “A”, all the other three answers are correct. The Courts have held
that if more than correct answer has been suggested in multiple choice
questions and a candidate has given one of the said answers as correct,
he cannot be denied the marks for the said questions. The petitioner,
therefore, would be entitled to 5 marks for the said question (four for the
answer given and one for deduction made by way of negative marks).

                                       15
              Question No. 273 is as follows:
                             “Mucocele is common in which of the
       following sinuses:
                      A. Maxillary sinus
                      B. Frontal sinus
                      C. Ethmoidal sinus
                      D. Sphenoidal sinus
                      Key Answer - B        Candidate’s Answer – C”
              The petitioner gave the answer “C”, whereas the key answer
was given as “B”.
              A reference to diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat , 4 th Edition
by    P.L. Dhingra, formerly Director, Professor and head of the
Department of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery, Maulana Azad
Medical College shows that the sinuses commonly affected by mucocele
in the order of frequency, are the frontal, ethmoidal, maxillary and
sphenoidal. It, therefore, appears that all the four answers given can be
said to be correct answes. Therefore, the petitioner cannot be deprived of
marks for the above question having given the answer “C” as the correct
answer. Therefore, the petitioner would be entitled to 5 marks for this
question.
              It is, thus, found that the petitioner is entitled to 25 marks
more with regard to the questions mentioned in the additional affidavit.
Hence, in toto, the petitioner would be entitled to 60 marks more than
what has been awarded to him in the said entrance examination.
15.            In W.P.(C) No. 3351 of 2009
                The petitioner alleges that expecting more marks in the
entrance examination though he applied to the Convenor for supplying
all copies of the answer keys under the R.T.I. Act, having not been

                                     16
supplied with the same before the date which was fixed for counselling
has approached this Court. By an interim order, learned counsel for the
opp. parties was directed to produce the answer scripts of the petitioner.
On verifying the same, the petitioner has filed a Misc. Case stating that
he has been given 30 marks less than what he is entitled to as the
answers given to Question Nos. 29, 59, 110, 225, 284 and 287 though
were correct he has not been awarded with any marks for the aforesaid
questions. He was supplied with a Question Answer Booklet differential
from the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009 but continuing the same
question with change in particulars. The answer given by the petitioner
was ‘C’ and as such, for the reasons already stated above, the petitioner
is entitled to 5 marks for the said question (4 marks for the answer given
and one mark which has been deducted as negative marks). Same is the
case with regard to Question No. 59 whether the petitioner answered
correctly suggesting ‘D’ as the correct answer and he is entitled to 5
marks for the aforesaid question.
               Question No. 110 is as follows:
               “The net number of ATP molecules formed per
        molecule of glucose in aerobic glycolysis is –
               A.     2
               B.     6
               C.     18
               D.     36 ”
               The petitioner suggested ‘A’ as the correct answer but the
model answer has been suggested as ‘B’.
               In the Textbook of Medical Biochemistry (6th Edition) by Dr.
(Brig) MN Chatterjea, an Ex-Professor and Head of the Department of
Biochemstry Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, it has been stated that
the net number of ATP molecules formed as per molecule of glucose in
aerobic Glycolysis is 8 ATP. Therefore, nothing of the answer suggested

                                         17
for the above question is correct. Thus, applying the ratio of the decision
in the case of Raghunath (supra), the petitioner will be entitled to 5
marks for the above question.         The answer given by the petitioner to
Question No. 225 being corrected as already discussed, he is entitled to 5
marks for the said question. Similarly, for the Question Nos. 284 and
287, the petitioner having answered correctly shall be entitled to 5 marks
each in the above questions. Thus, the petitioner in toto will be entitled
to 30 marks more than what has been awarded to him. The petitioner
also claims that he is entitled to weightage of 10% of marks secured
having served in KBK/Tribal/Backward areas as per Clause-11.2 of the
Information Brochure.        If, in fact, the petitioner has served for three
years in the aforesaid area as per Clause-11.2, he shall be entitled to
10% of marks secured as weightage.
16.              In W.P.(C) No. 3352 of 2009
                The petitioner has made a prayer in the writ petition which
is as follows:
                “It is, therefore, prayed that this Hon’ble Court may
        graciously be pleased to:
            I) Admit the writ application;
            II) Call for the records;
            III) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate
        writ/writs, direction/directions directing the opposite parties,
        particularly Opp. Party No. 3 to verify the answer scripts of
        the petitioner regarding the coding and decoding, addition,
        substraction in the total marks and allotment 10% of the
        secured marks for serving in KBK/Tribal/Backward areas as
        per Clause No. 11.2 of the Prospectus and accordingly the
        petitioner Rank No. in the merit list of in-service category
        candidates may be corrected;
        IV) And/or pass such other order/orders, direction/directions
        as this Hon’ble Court may think fit and proper for the ends of
        justice;”
                During pendency of the writ petition, the petitioner has filed
a misc. case in Court, inter alia, stating that she has correctly answered
5 questions being Question Nos. 129, 59, 10, 163 and 184 but has not

                                      18
been awarded any marks for the aforesaid questions and 5 marks has
been deducted by way of negative marks. She has also stated that with
regard to Question No. 187, the question itself is ambiguous.           For
convenience, the Question No. 187 is dealt with first. The said question
is the same as Question No. 187 in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009. The said
question is not ambiguous and therefore, the petitioner has rightly not
been awarded with any marks for the said question and 1 mark has been
deducted by way of negative marks.        Now coming to the Question No.
129, the petitioner claims to have given ‘C’ as the correct answer. With
regard to Question No. 59, the petitioner has given the answer ‘D’ as the
correct answer. The above two questions are same as Question Nos. 129
and 59 in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009.        The petitioner having answered
correctly and the Key Answers being suggested are wrong, therefore, she
is entitled to 5 marks each for the above two questions.
               Question No. 10 is as follows:
                      “The net number of ATP molecules formed as
               per molecule of glucose in aerobic glycolysis is :
               A.    2
               B.    6
               C.    18
               D.    36”
               The petitioner has referred to the Textbook of Medical
Biochemistry (6th Edition) which clearly states that 8 is the correct
answer which is not suggested in any of the answers given. Thus, for the
reasons stated with regard to the said Question No. 10 which is the same
in W.P.(C) No. 3351 of 2009, the petitioner would be entitled to 5 marks
for the said question. With regard to Question Nos. 163 and 184, which
are same as the Question Nos. 163 and 184 in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009,
the petitioner having answered correctly for the said questions is entitled
to 5 marks each for the said questions.       Thus, in toto, the petitioner

                                     19
would be entitled to 25 marks more than what has been awarded to her
in the entrance examination.
17.             In W.P.(C) No. 4423 of 2009
              Though initially the petitioner did not claim any extra
marks for having answered any of the questions correctly but
subsequently he filed a misc. case in Court, inter alia, stating that on
verification of the answers and the Key Answers, he found that he has
answered Question Nos. 29, 284 and 287 correctly and has further
stated that none of the suggested answer to Question No. 10 is correct
and the question no. 59 is ambiguous. Question No. 59 is the same as
Question No. 59 dealt with in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009 and the said
question is not ambiguous. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to 5
marks for the said question. However, with respect to Question No. 10
which is the same as Question No. 10 dealt with in W.P.(C) No. 3352 of
2009, none of the answer suggested being correct, the petitioner will be
entitled to 5 marks for the said question. With regard to Question Nos.
29, 284 and 287 which are same as the Question Nos. 129, 184 and 187
dealt with in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009, the petitioner having correctly
answered the aforesaid questions will be entitled to 5 marks each for the
said questions. Thus, in toto, the petitioner is entitled to 20 marks more
than what has been awarded to him in the entrance examination.
18.             In W.P.(C) No. 6045 of 2009
                The petitioner claims to have given correct answers to
Question Nos. 64, 122, 237 and 252.
              Question No. 64 is as follows:
              “The drug approved for use in premature labour is:
                  A. Salbutamol
                  B. Terbutaline
                  C. Ritodrine
                  D. Isoxuprine”

                                        20
                The petitioner gave the answer ‘D’ as the correct answer
but the Key Answer has been given as ‘C’.       A reference is made to a
Textbook of Obstetrics by D.C. Dutta (6th Edition) wherein in Chapter
“Preterm Labour”, which is synonym to Preterm Labour under the
heading “Management of Preterm Labour”.           The author writes “the
Management includes : (1) to prevent preterm onset of labour, if possible
(2) to arrest preterm labour, if not contraindicated (3) appropriate
management of labour (4) effective neonatal care. The author has further
mentioned that the drugs which can be used for a short period as
terbutaline, ritodrine and isoxsuprine. Thus, except the suggested
answer ‘A’, all the other three answers are correct. The Courts have held
that if more than correct answer has been suggested in multiple choice
questions and a candidate has given one of the said answers as correct,
he cannot be denied the marks for the said questions. The petitioner,
therefore, would be entitled to 5 marks for the said question (4 for the
answer given and 1 for deduction made by way of negative marks).
              In Question No. 122, the petitioner has given the answer ‘D’
as the correct answer. This question is the same as Question No. 122 as
discussed in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009.      Thus, for the reasons already
stated, the petitioner is entitled to 5 marks for the aforesaid question.
Question No. 237 is the same as Question No. 187 in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of
2009 and the petitioner having given answer ‘A’ as the correct answer is
entitled to 5 marks for the aforesaid question.
        Question No. 252 is as follows:
        “Fetal post maturity is assessed by
                A.    Loss of sole fat.
                B.    Shining skin
                C.    Loss of Lanugos hair
                D.    Enzyme assays”

                                       21
               The petitioner answer ‘C’ as the correct answer but the Key
Answer has been given as ‘A’. A reference is made to a Nelson Textbook
of Pediatrics (18th Edition) Vol. I where the author says that the post-
term, post-mature infants often have increased birth-weight and are
characterised by the absence of lanugo, decreased or absent vernix
caseosa, long nails, abundant scalp hair, white parchment – like or
desquamating skin and increased alertness.            Reference to the above
textbook shows that the answer suggested by the petitioner is the most
appropriately correct answer to the said question, therefore, the
petitioner is entitled to 5 marks for the aforesaid question. Thus, in toto,
it has been demonstratively shown that the petitioner has given correct
answer to the aforesaid 4 questions and is entitled to 20 marks more
than what has been awarded to him.
19.            In W.P.(C) No. 6062 OF 2009
               The petitioner in this writ petition is a direct candidate, who
appeared in the entrance examination for taking admission to P.G.
Medical Courses, 2009. She claims to have answered question Nos. 13,
46, 129, 203, 204, 237 and 252 in the question answer book let
supplied to her correctly, but has not been awarded four marks for each
of the said questions and seven marks have been deducted by way of
negative marking from her total marks.
                      Question No. 13 is as follows:
                      “Spinal root ganglion contains:
                      A.  Psudounipolar neurones
                      B.  Unipolar neurones
                      C.  Multipolar neurones
                      D.  Bipolar neurones.”
               The petitioner gave choice ‘B’ as the correct answer,
whereas the key answer was suggested as ‘A’.

                                         22
                In   A.K.    Datta’s  Essentials   of  Human     Anatomy     and
Neuroanatomy, the author states as follows:-
                        Unipolar neurons – The cell bodies of
                these neurons are located in the dorsal root
                ganglia of spinal nerves and corresponding
                ganglia of cranial nerves.
                In the Text Book of Human Histology by Inderbir Singh, the
author states as follows:-
                        “Sensory ganglia are present on the
                dorsal nerve roots of spinal nerves, where they
                are called dorsal nerve root ganglia or spinal
                ganglia. They are also present on the 5 th, 7th,
                8th, 9th and 10th cranial nerves. We have seen
                that the neurons in these ganglia are of the
                unipolar type.”
Thus,    it  is   clear    that  the   answer   given   by   the  petitioner   is
demonstratively shown to be correct. The petitioner is, therefore, entitled
to five marks for the above question (four for the answer given and one as
the mark which has been deducted by way of negative marking).
                Question No. 46 is as follows:
                    “Which one of the following enzyme is functional
        in plasma ?
                        A.  Amylase
                        B.  Lipase
                        C.  Cholinesterase
                        D.  G.Glutamyl transpeptidase”
                The petitioner gave the answer “B” as the correct answer.
The key answer suggested was “C”. Reference has been made to Harper’s
Illustrated Biochemistry. The author in the said book states examples of
these     functional     plasma      enzymes    include    lipoprotein    lipase,
pseudocholinesterase and the proenzymes of blood coagulation and
blood clot dissolution. It is, thus, seen that the answer “B”, i.e. lipase as
given by the petitioner is most appropriately correct answer and the key

                                       23
answer suggested cannot be said to be the correct answer. The petitioner
will be entitled to five marks for this question.
               Question No. 129 is the same as question No. 129 in W.P.
(C) No. 5473 of 2009. The petitioner gave the answer “C”, whereas the
key answer suggested was “D”. For the reasons assigned under the said
question in the aforesaid writ petition (WPC 5437/2009), the petitioner
will be entitled to five marks for this question.
               Question No. 203 is as follows:
                “At birth the Fetal hemoglobin level of normal term
       infant is:-
                       A. 90%
                       B. 80%
                       C. 70%
                       D. 60%”.
               The petitioner gave “B” as the correct answer, whereas the
key answer suggested was “C”.
                       In the Text Book of Obstetrics by D.C.
           Dutta, the author states that in the early period, the
           erythropoiesis is megaloblastic but near term it
           becomes normoblastic. The fatal blood picture at
           term shows RBC 5-6 million per cu mm; HB% 110-
           150%, reticulocytes – 5% and erythroblast-10%.
           During the first half, the haemoglobin is of fetal
           type (a- 2, y-2) but from 24 weeks onwards, adult
           type of haemoglobin (a-2, b-2) appears and at term
           about 75-80% of the total haemoglobin is of fetal
           type HbF.”
Thus, the answer given by the petitioner is demonstratively shown to be
correct and the petitioner will be entitled to five marks for this question.
       Question No.204 is as follows:
                       “Syndrome of inappropriate Anti-Diuretic
         hormone secretion occurs in all the conditions except:
                       A. Diabetes insipidus
                       B. Acute glomerulo nepmus
                       C. Encephalitis
                       D. Pneumonia”

                                      24
              The petitioner answered “A” as the correct answer. The key
answer suggested was “B”.
              The books referred by the petitioner for substantiating her
case is Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine and Review of Medical
Physiology, 21st Edition, but from the portion, which has been relied
upon from the aforesaid book, it is not clear as to whether the answer
given by the petitioner is correct or as to whether the key answer
suggested was incorrect. Therefore, this Court feels that the petitioner
will not be entitled to any mark in this question, i.e., question no.204.
              Question No. 237 is the same as question No. 187 in
W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009, wherein it has already been discussed that
the answer “A” is the corrected answer and key answer suggested, i.e.,
“C” was incorrect. The petitioner having given “A” as the correct answer,
she would be entitled to five marks for this question.
              Question No. 252 is the same as question no. 252 in W.P.
(C) No. 6045 of 2009, wherein as already discussed, the answer “C” is the
correct answer and the key answer given as “A”            was incorrect. The
petitioner having given her choice as “C” would be entitled to five marks
for this question. Thus, in toto, the petitioner will be entitled to 30 marks
more than what has been secured by her.
20.           On the above analysis, these writ petitions are disposed of
with the following directions:
              The petitioner-Gautam Patnaik in W.P.(C) No. 5473 of 2009
will be awarded 60 marks more than what has been awarded to him in
the entrance examination.
              Similarly, the petitioner-Manas Ranjan Samantaray in W.P.
(C) No. 3351 of 2009 will be awarded 30 marks more than what has been
awarded to him in the entrance examination..

                                      25
               Likewise the petitioner-Dr. Sunita Mohanty in W.P.(C) No.
3352 of 2009 will be awarded 25 marks more than what has been
awarded to her in the entrance examination.
               The petitioner-Dr. Paresh Kumar Acharya in W.P.(C) No.
4423 of 2009 will be awarded 20 marks more than what has been
awarded to him in the entrance examination.
               The petitioner-Dr. Mohan Barik in W.P.(C) No. 6045 of 2009
will be awarded 20 marks more than what has been awarded to him in
the entrance examination.
               The petitioner-Dr. Sunita Behera in W.P.(C) No. 6062 of
2009 will be awarded 30 marks more than what has been awarded to her
in the entrance examination.
21.            The Convenor of the P.G. (Medical) Selection Committee,
2009 is directed to add the above marks in respect of each of the
petitioners to the marks already secured by them and, accordingly, find
out their ranking in the merit list before the counselling commences on
production of a certified copy of this judgment. The counselling shall be
continued thereafter in accordance with the merit list of the selected
candidates.
22.            It would be worthwhile to refer to the anxiety of this Court
expressed in the case of Pariyadarshini Acharya (supra) as well as in the
case of Raghunath Pradhan (supra).            This Court in the case of
Priyadarshini Acharya (supra) referring to the decision in the case of
Kanupur University (supra) of the Apex Court observed as follows:
               “A large number of cases are being filed every year for
       verifying the valuation made by the examining body. In some
       years, there was change in valuation after the key answers were
       produced and the performance of the candidate was verified with
       reference thereto. To avoid this, a demand has been raised for
       publication of the key result after the examination. There is
       understandably opposition by the State to this demand. It is

                                        26
       urged by the latter that the key answer furnished should not be
       challenged. Considering this, the Supreme Court observed in
       Kanpur University case (AIR 1983 SC 1230) that was not the
       correct way of looking at these matters which involved the future
       of hundreds of students who were aspirants for admission to
       professional courses. If the key answers were kept secret, the
       remedy would have been worse than the disease because so many
       students would have had to suffer the injustice in silence. The
       publication of the key answers unravelled an unhappy state of
       affairs to which the University and the State Government must
       find a solution. We have noticed the controversy in relation to the
       answers to certain questions in this case. Such controversy and
       lapses can be avoided if the State Government complies under its
       auspices a text book which should be prescribed for students
       desirous of appearing at the entrance examinations. This was
       precisely the recommendation of the Supreme Court in Kanpur
       University –v- Samir Gupta, AIR 1983 SC 1230. The Supreme
       Court recommended and we reiterate that henceforth the
       questions should be modulated by a body of experts chosen by
       the State Government and objective type questions should be set
       in such a manner that questions having ambiguous import are
       not set. Answers should contain one correct answer and the rest
       should be either incorrect or nearly correct leaving no scope for
       reasoning or argument except merely involving tick-marking the
       correct answer. The question, therefore, has to be clear and
       equivocal and, as was recommended by the Supreme Court, we
       direct that if attention of the Government or the examining body
       is drawn to any defect in the key answer or to any question,
       timely decision should be taken to declare the exclusion of the
       suspect question from the paper so that no marks are assigned to
       it.”
23.            In the case of Raghunath Pradhan (supra), this Court
reiterated   the   anxiety    of   this Court  expressed     in   the    case of
Priayadarshini Acharya (supra) which has been quoted above.
24.            Since in all probabilities many other candidates, who have
not approached this Court, may now think up approaching this Court
after delivery of this judgment, it would be apt on the part of this Court
to close such flood gate and, accordingly, this Court directs that the writ
petitions filed after 19.5.2009 in this regard claiming more marks shall
not be entertained by this Court.
                                                    ……………………
                                                       M.M. Das, J.
Orissa High Court, Cuttack.
