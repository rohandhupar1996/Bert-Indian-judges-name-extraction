  PRESENT :
                THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE S. N. PRASAD
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Date of hearing and judgement :- 29.1.2016
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S.N.Prasad, J.           The petitioner being aggrieved with the order passed
in Anganwadi Appeal No.32 of 2011 dated 23.08.2011 is before this
Court.
2.               Brief facts of the case of the petitioner is that in pursuance
to notification dated 12.7.2006 a meeting of Mahila Sabha was scheduled
to be fixed on 8.8.2006 in order to select and engage the Anganwadi
Worker in Kandiasahi Anganwadi centre and accordingly four candidates
namely Chandrakanti Nayak (petitioner), Geetanjali Jena, Shantilata Rout
and Swapnarani Parida submitted their applications before the C.D.P.O.,

                                      2
Chandbali. The meeting of Mahila Sabha was held on 8.8.2006,
candidature of Swapnarani Parida was rejected due to underage. The
candidature of Shantilata Rout was also rejected on the ground of not
belonging to the service area of the centre, candidature of Geetanjali Jena
was not taken into consideration by the Mahila Sabha as she filed a
petition for withdrawal of her candidature and hence the petitioner
became single eligible candidate and accordingly her name was suggested
by the Mahila Sabha for selection and engagement of Anganwadi Worker
for the centre.
3.              But the CDPO, instead of issuing engagement order in
favour of the petitioner, delayed the matter and in the meanwhile revised
guideline has come into force w.e.f. 2.5.2007 and hence a new notification
inviting fresh applications was issued on 9.7.2007. In pursuance of the
notification dated 9.7.2007, Swapnarani Parida whose candidature was
rejected in the earlier notification dated 12.07.06 applied for the said
post.
4.              The petitioner being aggrieved with the action of the CDPO
has filed writ petition before this Court being W.P.(C) No.1756 of 2011 for
issuance of direction to issue engagement order in favour of the
petitioner, the writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 05.05.2011
directing the petitioner to file fresh representation before the authority
who shall consider the same.
5.              Opposite party no.5 has also filed another writ petition
being W.P.(C) No.11467 of 2011 praying therein to direct opposite party
no.3 to conclude the appeal and to direct the Collector, Bhadrak to
expedite the selection process and after receipt of order passed by this
Court in W.P.(C) No.1756 of 2011 and W.P.(C) No.11467 of 2011,          the
ADM, Bhadrak clubbed the Anganwadi Appeal No.32 of 2011 filed by the
petitioner and Anganwadi Appeal No.35 of 2011 filed by opposite party
no.5 for analogous hearing and thereafter the ADM, Bhadrak has passed

                                      3
common order on 23.08.2011 which is assailed in this writ petition on the
ground that the irregularities having been pointed out by the ADM vide
notification dated 12.07.2006 cannot be vitiated entire selection process
since the CDPO who has issued the notification in the capacity of member
secretary of the Selection Committee as per the Guideline issued in the
year 1998.
6.             So far as the irregularities no.2 is concerned, it has been
submitted that the guideline for selection of  Anganwadi Worker is of the
year 1998 which authorizes the Mahila Sabha to recommend the name or
names of the candidates and also to discharge certain duties in
connection with the selection of Anganwadi worker. Hence, the finding of
the learned ADM is that the decision taken in the Mahila Sabha has been
fault and cannot be held good.
7.             So far as irregularities no.3 is concerned, rejection of
candidature of two candidates on the ground of outside service area and
underage respectively is matter on record and after verifying all these
aspects of the matter, the petitioner was found to be eligible candidate.
8.             So far as irregularities no.4 is concerned, it has been
submitted that the earlier notification dated 12.07.2006 was never been
cancelled.
9.             It has been contended that once any advertisement is
issued, it has to be given its logical end by concluding the selection
process.
               It has further been contended that since the notification
dated 12.07.2006 was issued in pursuance to the guideline issued in the
year 1998 as such the selection process ought to have been concluded in
pursuance to the guideline issued in the year 1998 and on the basis of

                                       4
the subsequent guideline which has been issued on 2.5.2007, in
pursuance of the same new guideline has been issued.
10.             Learned    counsel  for  the  petitioner   has  relied  upon
judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in the cases of Y.V. Rangaiah vrs. J.
Sreenivasa reported in AIR 1983 SC 852 and State of Bihar and
another vrs. Madan Mohan Singh reported in AIR 1994 SC 765 and also
judgement passed by this Court in the case of Kabita Swain vrs. State of
Orissa and others reported in 2014 (I) OLR 194 and unreported order
passed in W.P.(C) No.9180 of 2007 in support of his case.
11.             Opposite party no.4-the CDPO has filed counter affidavit
inter alia stating therein that in pursuance to notification dated
12.07.2006 Mahila Sabha was conducted on 8.8.2007 for selection and
engagement of Anganwadi worker and ultimately Mahila Sabha had
recommended the name of the petitioner and one Geetanjali Jena, in the
said selection process, Geetanjali Jena had secured more marks than the
petitioner but she withdrawn her application as on the relevant point of
time she was working as Gram Sikhya Sahayak at Tentulidihi ME School
and finally the name of the petitioner recommended to be selected as
Anganwadi Worker as such there was no candidate except the petitioner
hence fresh advertisement has been issued.
12.             Opposite party-State has appeared and filed counter
affidavit inter alia stating therein that the petitioner since has got lesser
marks than Geetanjali Jena and there is some irregularities having been
found out by the competent authority hence the authorities have decided
to go for fresh selection and accordingly fresh notification was issued on
9.7.2007 in which the petitioner has participated but declared fail. Hence,
after becoming unsuccessful in the selection process he cannot challenge
the said section process.

                                       5
13.            It has been contended by the opposite parties that the
judgment relied upon by the petitioner is not applicable in the facts and
circumstances of this case.
14.            Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents on record.
               Undisputed fact in this case is that in pursuance to an
advertisement issued on 12.07.2006, out of four candidates, the
petitioner and one Geetanjali Jena has secured higher marks but she
withdrawn her candidature hence the petitioner being the single
candidate, the competent authority has come out a fresh advertisement
on 9.7.2007 inviting fresh applications in which the petitioner has also
made application along with opposite party no.5 who was unsuccessful
candidate in pursuance to the advertisement dated 12.07.2006.
15.            The    petitioner     has  challenged     the   subsequent
advertisement dated 9.7.2007 on the ground that the first advertisement
issued on 12.07.2006 ought to have been given logical end by concluding
the selection process by making engagement but that has not been done
hence the selection committee has committed an illegality.
               Further argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner
is that the authority should not have issued a second advertisement on
9.7.2007    in  which   the   petitioner has   participated  but   declared
unsuccessful.
16.            Now, question which fell for consideration before this Court
is as to whether the petitioner has a right to challenge the second
advertisement in which she has participated and declared unsuccessful.

                                           6
17.               Rule is settled that if in an advertisement, a candidate
appears     crossed     through    all   the  selection  process and   declared
unsuccessful he will cease to challenge the said selection process.
18.               In this regard, reference may be made to the judgement
rendered by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of K.H. Siraj vrs. High
Court of Kerala reported in (2006) 6 SCC 395 in paras 72 and 74, it has
been held that the candidates who participated in the interview with
knowledge that for selection they had to secure prescribed minimum marks
on being unsuccessful in interview could not turn around and challenge
that the said provision of minimum marks was improper, said challenge is
liable to be dismissed on the ground of estoppel.
                  Another reference made to the judgment rendered by
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India vrs. S. Vinod
Kumar reported in (2007) 8 SCC 100 at para-18 it has been held that is
being reproduced herein below:-
        “18.....It is also well settled that those candidates who had taken
        part in the selection process knowing fully well the procedure
        laid down therein were not entitled to question the same.”
                  Another reference made to the judgement rendered by
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Vijendra Kumar Verma vrs. Public
Service Commission, Uttarakhand and others reported (2011) 1 SCC 150
at para-24, it has been held that:-
      “24. ............Knowing the said criteria, the appellant also
      appeared in the interview, faced the questions from the expert of
      computer application and has taken a chance and opportunity
      therein without any protest at any stage and now cannot turn
      back to state that the aforesaid procedure adopted was wrong
      and without jurisdiction.”

                                           7
  19.             Applying the settled principle laid down by Hon’ble
  Supreme Court referred hereinabove, it is being held here that the
  petitioner will cease to challenge the selection process after participation
  in the same and declared unsuccessful.
  20.             So far as the contention of the petitioner is that the
  authority ought to have concluded the selection process which was
  initiated in pursuance of the advertisement dated 12.07.2006 by issuing
  engagement order in favour of the petitioner.
  21.             From perusal of the order passed by the ADM, four
  irregularities have been found in the selection process which is being
  quoted herein below for ready reference:-
(1)     On perusal of Notification, it is seen that the letter number has
        been written as 195 dated 12.07.2006 by cutting letter No.226
        dated 2.5.2006 without initial. The memo numbers have also
        been cut without initial. This is highly irregular and lacks
        transparency.
(2)     The decision taken in Mahila Sabha is not fir, it has been decided
        in the above Mahila Sabha to select Chandrakanti Nayak
        (appellant in Appeal No.32 of 2011) first who had secured less
        marks which was illegal. Subsequently, they decided to select
        another applicant namely Gitanjali Nayak who had scored
        highest marks. Subsequently, it was managed to bring one no-
        objection certificate in favour of Gitanjali Nayak which indicates
        that Chandrakanti Nayak gained over Mahila Sabha. It is
        against transparency and the proceeding is vitiated.
(3)     The selection of the name of two candidates on the ground of out-
        side area and under age has not been duly enquired into which
        transpires that the then Mahila Sabha had preconceived thought
        to appoint a particular candidate which is illegal.
(4)     Probably due to the above reasons the Ex-CDPO, Chandbali has
        again issued notification vide letter No.338 dated 9.7.2007.

                                       8
                Allegation no.2 and 3 is important which was taken into
consideration by the competent authority by holding therein that some
irregularities have been committed in the selection process and as such in
order to adopt fair and transparency, the selection committee has decided
to go for fresh notification on 9.7.2007.
22.             The contention raised by the petitioner is that logical end
ought to have been given to the first advertisement issued on 12.07.2006
by issuing engagement order, that cannot be accepted in the facts and
circumstances of this case as because the Selection Committee has taken
decision after perusing irregularities committed in the selection process
and as such they have decided to go for fresh advertisement which is their
decision and in the facts of this case, the decision taken by the competent
authority cannot be held to be improper for the reason that irregularities
have been committed which is being reflected in the order impugned.
23.             The petitioner has not been prejudiced by issuance of
second advertisement since she has been given the opportunity to
participate in the fresh selection process in which she has participated
but become unsuccessful.
24.             It is settled that a candidate cannot be held to be having
vested right merely on account of having been selected in the selection
process or recommended for engagement in the said selection process
rather the vested right will be said to be accrued only when the
appointment letter will be issued in favour of the candidate but that stage
had not come and merely on the ground of sole candidate in the
competition, the petitioner cannot claim engagement as a matter of right
and she cannot question the decision of the competent authority in
issuing the second advertisement.

                                      9
25.            If   the    selection committee    has    found    that some
irregularities/illegalities have been committed, they are free to take
decision on the basis of the facts before them to go for fresh selection in
order to adopt fair and transparent selection process and this Court
sitting under Article 226 of the Constitution of India who refrain from
interfere when the policy decision of the Selection Committee unless some
mala fide will be shown in the decision making process. But that is not
the case of the petitioner.
               The ADM after taking into consideration all aspects of the
matter has approved the decision of the Selection Committee and passed
order.
26.            So far as the judgement referred by the learned counsel for
the petitioner in the case of State of Bihar and another vrs. Madan
Mohan Singh and others reported in AIR 1994 SC 765, the same is not
applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case as because the said
case is related with filling up the vacancies of Add. Dist. Judge while the
judgement rendered in the case of Y. V. Rangaiah and others vrs. J.
Sreenivasa reported in AIR 1983 SC 852 the same is also not applicable
since the facts and circumstances of this is totally different from the case
of said judgment since the said case is related regarding grant of
promotion on the basis of amended rule or pre-amended rule but that is
not applicable in the facts of this case because the petitioner has
participated in pursuance of the second advertisement which according to
the petitioner has been issued in terms of new guideline dated 2.5.2007
hence she will be ceased to challenge the same since participated in the
selection process.
               The judgment referred in the case of Kabita Swain vrs.
State of Orissa and others reported in 2014 (I) OLR 194 and the order
passed in W.P.(C) No.9180 of 2007 is also not applicable, in view of the
fact that in the said judgement, the facts are totally different.

                                      10
27.             This Court sitting under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India cannot act as an appellate court and reverse the fact finding given
by the Selection Committee or the appellate authority.
                In view thereof and for the foregoing reasons, there is no
infirmity in the impugned order or in the selection making process,
accordingly the writ petition is dismissed being devoid of merits.
                                               ……………………..
