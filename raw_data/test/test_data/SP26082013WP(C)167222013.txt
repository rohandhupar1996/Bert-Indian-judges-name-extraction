                       W.P.(C) NO.16722 OF 2013
2. 26.8.2013         Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Addl.
             Government Advocate.
             2.      This Writ Petition has been filed by the petitioner challenging the
             order    dtd.28.7.1998    passed   by    the  Addl.    District Magistrate,
             Bhubaneswar in Revision Case No.836 of 1998 under Section 7A (3) of
             the O.G.L.S Act, 1962 cancelling the lease granted in favour of the
             original lessee by the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar in W.L Lease Case
             No.1635 of 1974 without giving an opportunity of hearing to the
             petitioner.
             3.      On perusal of records, it appears that the land appertaining to
             Plot No.647 under Khata No.420 of Mouza – Patharagadia measuring
             an area of Ac.1.000 decimals was originally leased out in favour of one
             Ullas Dei by the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar in W.L Lease Case No.1635
             of 1974 for agricultural purposes. The original lessee sold a portion of
             the aforesaid land in favour of the petitioner measuring Ac.0.125
             decimals under Registered Sale Deed dtd.22.8.1986. After mutation the
             petitioner    has   been     assigned     Khata   No.325/540      of   Plot
             No.647/1628/2183. After purchasing the land the petitioner is in peaceful
             possession over the same and was paying rent regularly. In the year
             1998 the Addl. District Magistrate, Bhubaneswar initiated a suo motu
             revision under Section 7A (3) of the O.G.L.S Act, 1962, which was
             registered as Revision Case No.908 of 1998. Notice was issued to the
             original lessee and she has appeared before the Addl. District
             Magistrate. After hearing the parties and going through the materials
             available on record, the Addl. District Magistrate came to a conclusion
             that enquiry has not been done properly by the Tahasildar as required
             under Rule 3 (3) of the O.G.L.S Rules, 1974 and proclamation inviting
   BP        objections has not been properly served as provided under Rule 3 (5) of
             the said Rules. The land settlement was made without observance of
             the provisions of Section 3(2) of the Act wherein it is provided that 70 %

                       2
of the Government Land should be settled in favour of the S.T and S.C
people of the village. Accordingly, the Addl. District Magistrate by the
impugned order set aside the order of the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar
settling the land in question in favour of the original lessee.
4.      The original lease having been granted pursuant to order dated
11.10.1974 passed by the Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar in W.L Lease Case
No.1635 of 1974, it was not open to the Addl. District Magistrate,
Bhubaneswar to initiate the Revision Case in the year 1998, suo motu
under Section 7-A of the O.G.L.S. Act as the second proviso to the said
section prescribes that after lapse of a period of 14 years, no revision
under the said Section can be initiated. That apart an opportunity of
hearing having not been given to the petitioner, the impugned order is
unsustainable.
5.      In view of the above, this Court while setting aside the impugned
order    dtd.28.7.1998     passed    by   the   Addl.    District  Magistrate,
Bhubaneswar in Revision Case No.836 of 1998 so far as it relates to the
petitioner, remits the matter back to the said authority for fresh disposal.
If the petitioner files an application before the Addl. District Magistrate –
opposite party no.2 along with certified copy of this order as well as
relevant documents within three weeks from today for fresh hearing of
Revision Case No.836 of 1998, the said opposite party shall fix a date of
hearing and dispose of the matter in accordance with law, as
expeditiously as possible, after giving her an opportunity of hearing.
        This Writ Petition along with Misc. Case is accordingly disposed
of.
                                                          ……………………..
                                                                  S.Panda, J.
                                                         ………….…………..
                                                          Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.
