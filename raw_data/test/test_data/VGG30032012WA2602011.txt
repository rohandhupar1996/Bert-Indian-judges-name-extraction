                                   AND
                 THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA
                             Date of Judgment:30.03.2012
B.N.MAHAPATRA,J.            In  this  Writ   Appeal,  the  appellant  challenges
       correctness/legality of the judgment dated 17.03.2011 passed by a
       learned Single Judge of this Court in W.P.(C) No.19826 of 2010 wherein
       the order dated 11.10.2010 passed in F.A.O. No.105 of 2009 by the

                                     2
learned Additional Special Judge (Vigilance)-cum-Additional District
Judge, Bhubaneswar, maintaining the order dated 19.12.2009 passed in
I.A. No.558 of 2008 by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division),
Bhubaneswar was confirmed.
2.            The facts and circumstances giving rise to filing of the
present Writ Appeal in a nutshell are as follows:-
              One Sanjay Kumar Neura describing himself as Secretary for
and on behalf of Board of Directors of Rotary Club of Bhubaneswar
Cosmopolitan has filed the present Writ Appeal. The respondents are the
Office bearers of the Rotary International under which the Rotary Club of
Bhubaneswar       Cosmopolitan    is  a   chartered   Club.   The   Rotary
International is an Association of Rotary Clubs throughout the World
(R.I.C.-2). The Rotary International is an organization of business and
professional leaders united world wide to provide service to the humanity
to encourage high ethical standards in all vocations and help to build
goodwill and peace across the World. The Rotary Club of Bhubaneswar
Cosmopolitan is connected with the Rotary International having certain
control and guidance which is of course to be guided as per the Manual
of Procedure (MoP) published by Rotary International. Such Manual
provides    various  provisions  covering   various  guidelines  including
constitution of Rotary International, Bye-law of Rotary International,
recommended       Rotary   Club   bye-law   with   other  guidelines.  On
06.12.2008, the plaintiff-Club received an e-mail allegedly issued on

                                      3
01.12.2008 by defendant No.1 through which the plaintiff was instructed
to discontinue the membership of previous President Sri P.K.Swain, an
active member of the plaintiff’s Club on or before 31.12.2008, on account
of some allegations indicating his involvement in mismanagement of
matching grant projects during the course of his tenure as President.
There was an indication in the said letter that if Sri P.K.Swain is not
expelled from membership of the Club of the plaintiff, the membership of
Club itself would be terminated. In response to such letter, the Rotary
Club of Bhubaneswar Cosmopolitan submitted reply on 10th December,
2008 indicating that such a course of action is not permissible as it
would amount to offending the statutory right as well as legal right of a
member, who can only be terminated from the membership of the Club
within the four corners of provisions of the Bye-law and principles of
natural justice. In spite of such letter, defendant No.1 issued another
letter dated 15.12.2008, in which it was specifically stated that if the
plaintiff’s Club continues to honour the membership of the previous
President Sri P.K.Swain, the membership of the said Club would be
terminated from Rotary International.
3.           According to the plaintiff-appellant, the direction with regard
to the discontinuation of membership of Sri Swain being not in
accordance with Bye-laws, the plaintiff-appellant did not carry out the
said direction. However, apprehending termination of membership of the
Club, the plaintiff-appellant instituted C.S. No.452 of 2008 and filed I.A.

                                     4
No.558 of 2008 for interim relief under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with
Section 151, CPC. The learned Civil Judge (Junior Division) on
27.12.2008 under Order 39 Rule 3, CPC granted interim protection and
issued notice to opposite parties to show cause. Some of the opposite
parties entered appearance and after hearing both parties interim order
granted on 27.12.2008 was modified to the extent that the above
protection was to be availed concerning the threat of termination as
embodied in the letter dated 01.12.2008. However, the membership of
the petitioner’s Club has been terminated by the Rotary International
during pendency of the suit mainly on account of its default in payment
of the dues before expiry of 270 days from the due date.
4.           On 19.12.2009, the plaintiff-appellant filed petition before
the Trial Court with a prayer for restoration of membership through
order of mandatory injunction on the allegation that the same has been
terminated by opposite parties without adhering to the procedure
contained in their bye-laws. According to the plaintiff-appellant, the
Rotary Club of Bhubaneswar Cosmopolitan has never defaulted in
payment of dues and therefore, termination of the membership of the
Club is illegal and violative of bye-laws and the Club is entitled to the
interim remedy of restoration of membership by way of mandatory
injunction.
5.           The   defendant-respondents    submitted    a joint  written
statement asserting that the suit has become infructuous in view of

                                      5
termination of membership of the Club. Maintainability of the suit is
challenged on the ground that membership of the Club has been
terminated on a cause which is independent of the cause of action for
which the suit has been filed. Further, once the Rotary International
terminated membership of the plaintiff’s Club for default in payment of
dues and communicated the order of termination dated 09.03.2009,
plaintiff is not entitled to any relief claimed in the suit. Under the
provisions of the bye-laws, Rotary International has every right to
suspend and terminate membership of a Club. Maintainability of the suit
was also challenged on the ground that the plaintiff-appellant, has no
locus standi to bring the suit in a representative capacity as the plaintiff’s
Club is neither a registered body nor a legal person in the eye of law.
6.           The    learned   Civil  Judge  (Jr.  Division),  Bhubaneswar
considering the rival contentions dismissed I.A. No.558 of 2008 as
infructuous. The learned First Appellate Court confirmed the order
mainly on the ground that the action taken by the Rotary International is
in accordance with the provisions of bye-laws. The learned Single Judge
dismissed the writ petition with a reasoned order holding that there is no
infirmity and illegality in the orders passed by the trial Court as well as
the First Appellate Court. Hence, the present writ appeal.
7.           Mr.R.C.Sarangi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
plaintiff-appellant submitted that the orders passed by the Courts below
are violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India and

                                      6
therefore, the same are liable to be quashed. The First Appellate Court has
acted like a Court of records exercising extra-ordinary jurisdiction under
Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of India and the learned Single
Judge decided the writ petition as First Appellate Court. Despite time and
again, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has specifically pointed out that while
deciding the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, this Court
ought not to act like appellate Court but the Court is simply concerned
with the jurisdictional error or errors apparent on the face of the record if
available causing complete failure of justice in the particular part. In the
present case, the specific allegation in the writ petition was limited to the
question that the learned First Appellate Court without deciding the
question of facts and law has come to an abrupt conclusion that the Civil
Court cannot interfere with the internal affairs of a Club like Rotary
International and virtually it has not discussed anything relating to the
merit of the order passed by the learned trial Court. Therefore, dismissal
of the appeal amounts to depriving a person from enjoying the right of
appeal. The sole question before the learned Single Judge was that as to
whether the procedure adopted by the First Appellate Court was in
accordance with law and whether there was any jurisdictional error
committed by the learned First Appellate Court while dismissing the
appeal. That being the question in the writ petition, learned Single Judge
had no other option than to quash the impugned order passed by the First
Appellate Court and remand the matter to the First Appellate Court so

                                      7
that the appellant’s Club would have been given the right of appeal in true
sense. But unfortunately, the learned Single Judge virtually has supplied
the reason by making scrutiny of the factual aspects to justify the order
passed by the learned First Appellate Court.
8.            Mr. Sarangi, further submitted that while deciding the interim
application, a Court has to apply its mind to the three necessary
ingredients like prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable
injury, but cannot decide the disputed issues like the cause of action and/
or otherwise which can only be determined after the evidence is adduced
by the parties. Therefore, the order of the learned Single Judge is
apparently bad in law having exceeded the limitation provided for
scrutinizing the order of the lower Court or the order impugned before it,
which is in clear contravention of the observations made by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Surya Dev Rai Vs. Ram Chander Rai and
others, reported in 2003 (II) OLR SC 361. On this score alone, the
judgment of the learned Single Judge is liable to be set aside. Learned
Single Judge has failed to appreciate that at interlocutory stage, a Court
cannot decide the disputed question of facts, particularly when it is the
claim of the appellant’s Club that its membership has been virtually
terminated with the oblique motive on the ground of filing a suit and in
spite of the interim injunction granted by flouting the judicial order taking
advantage of the modified order. The question of disputed facts could not
have been determined either by the learned Single Judge or by the learned

                                      8
Trial Court for deciding the impugned application. The Court must make
an endeavour to decide as to whether the lis is to be preserved or not
because of undisputed question of facts. The undisputed fact was that on
the date of filing of the suit, membership of the Club in question was not
terminated. On the date of passing of the preliminary interim modified
order, membership of the appellant’s Club has also not been terminated.
But just after passing of the order of modification, a plea was taken
relating to non-payment of the dues which abruptly arose prima facie
indicating the malice on the part of the respondents. Neither the learned
trial Court nor the First Appellate Court nor the High Court has ever made
any attempt to consider the effect of the allegations made in the plaint and
the materials on record and to consider as to whether on the date of filing
of the suit, the appellant’s Club was entitled to an order of temporary
injunction, which should have continued till disposal of the suit. The
appellant has been highly prejudiced by excessive exercise of jurisdiction
by the Courts below including the learned Single Judge and in the process
the appellant’s Club has helplessly been fighting against the orders which
have been passed in derogation of the power conferred on different courts
of law causing complete failure of justice to the appellant. The learned trial
Court is required to be directed to consider the application for restoration
of status-quo in respect of membership of appellant’s Club.
9.           Mr.B.H.Mohanty,      learned    counsel    appearing    for  the
respondents submitted that there is no infirmity or illegality in the orders

                                       9
passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court as well as the trial Court
and the First Appellate Court. Mr. Mohanty submitted that the Civil Suit
is not maintainable as the plaintiff has no locus standi to bring the suit in
a representative capacity as the petitioner’s Club is neither a registered
body nor a legal person in the eye of law. In support of his contention, he
relied upon a judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of
Hyderabad Cricket Association, Gymkhana Grounds Vs. Cambridge Cricket
Club and Anr., decided on 03.09.2002 (CRP No.2175 of 2002 and batch),
2002(5) ALD 818, 2002(6) ALT 268. It was further argued that since the
membership of the Rotary Club of Bhubaneswar Cosmopolitan has been
terminated on the ground of non-payment of dues, as provided under the
bye-laws, and the suit in question was filed by the plaintiff altogether on
different grounds, the I.A. arising out of C.S. No.452 of 2008 has rightly
been held to be infructuous by the learned Trial Court and confirmed by
the First Appellate Court and the learned Single Judge as well. The order
of termination of the membership of the appellant’s Club was passed, as
per the minutes of meeting in January, 2009 by the Board of Directors of
Rotary International reaffirming its decision taken in November, 2008, i.e.,
prior to institution of the suit. Reminder also issued to the Club as well as
the District Governor on 08.10.2008 and on 07.01.2009.
10.           On the rival contentions of the parties, the only question
that falls for consideration by this Court is as to whether the learned
Single Judge is justified in dismissing the writ petition on the ground

                                       10
that the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court are justified to
hold that in view of the termination of membership of the Rotary Club of
Bhubaneswar Cosmopolitan by the Rotary International on the ground of
non-payment of dues, the I.A. No.558 of 2008 arising out of C.S. No.452
of 2008 has become infructuous.
11.         Facts which are not in dispute are that one Sanjay Kumar
Neura describing himself as Secretary for and on behalf of Board of
Directors of Rotary Club of Bhubaneswar Cosmopolitan filed Civil Suit
No.452 of 2008 with the following prayers:-
      (a)   To   declare     that   letters   dated   01.12.2008   and
            15.12.2008 issued at the instance of the defendants
            are nullity in the eyes of law and are not legally
            enforceable;
      (b)   To    permanently      restrain    the   defendants   from
            terminating the membership of the plaintiff’s Club
            without following provisions provided under the Bye-
            law of Rotary International and other legal procedures;
      (c)   Pass a decree of mandatory injunction, directing the
            defendants to refrain from insisting the plaintiff to take
            any action beyond the scope of the Bye-law and
            constitution of the Club of the plaintiff and in case
            after filing of the suit it is found that the status quo of
            the plaintiff as on date of the suit has been altered by
            any means;

                                       11
      (d)    Decree of mandatory injunction passed directing
             restoration of the status quo of the plaintiff’s Club as
             on the date of the suit;
      (e)    Decree the suit with cost;
      (f)    Grant any other relief / reliefs as would be deemed
             just and proper.
12.          Along with Suit, the plaintiff-appellant filed I.A. No.558 of
2008 on 20.12.2008 under Order 39 Rule Rules 1 and 2 read with
Section 151, CPC with a prayer to temporarily restrain opposite parties
from terminating membership of the petitioner’s Club pursuant to letters
dated 01.12.2008 and 15.12.2008 and also without following the
procedure provided under Bye-law of the Rotary International pending
disposal of the suit.
             On 27.12.2008 the learned Trial Court has issued ad-interim
injunction to the following effect:-
                    “… Hence, the petition is allowed. The O.Ps.
             are     hereby     temporarily     restrained   from
             terminating the membership of the plaintiff Club
             as stated in the letters sent on 1.12.2008 by the
             Rotary International through O.P. No.1. This order
             is to be given effect to subject to the compliance of
             the proviso (a) of Order-39 Rule-3 CPC. It shall
             remain in force till the appearance of the O.Ps. in
             this case. Issue notice to the O.Ps. fixing the case
             to 20.1.2009 to show cause as to why the order of
             injunction shall not be made absolute.”
13.          On 20.01.2009, opposite parties filed written show cause
challenging order of injunction and prayed for vacation of the same. After

                                      12
hearing both parties, learned Trial Court has modified the order in the
following manner:-
                   “Considering the submissions of both the
             parties, I feel it necessary to restrain the O.Ps.
             from terminating the membership of the club only
             on the ground of its (the Plaintiff’s) failure to
             terminate the membership of P.K.Swain – a
             Rotarian Member of the Club without adhering to
             their Bye laws & Constitution until next day. They
             are at liberty to take action in accordance with
             their Bye-laws and Constitution. With these
             modifications, the order dated 27.12.08 is
             extended till next date.”
14.          On 09.03.2009, Rotary International issued a final letter
terminating the membership of the Club for non-payment of financial
obligation to Rotary International. On 21.04.2009, the plaintiff-appellant
filed a petition before the Trial Court with a prayer for restoration of
membership of the Club through order of mandatory injunction on the
allegation that the same has been terminated by the opposite parties
without adhering to the procedure contained in their Bye-law and
principles of natural justice. Learned Trial Court on 19.12.2009 passed
the final order in I.A. No.558 of 2008 and dismissed the same as
infructuous.
15.          The First Appellate Court placing reliance on the judgment of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court passed on 02.05.2005 in the case of Suresh
Bhasin Vs. Ramesh Chander & Ors., in SLP (Civil) No.8587 of 2005
confirmed the order of the Trial Court.

                                    13
16.          The learned Single Judge of this Court vide judgment dated
17.3.2011 passed in W.P.(C) No.19826 of 2010 has confirmed the order
dated 11.10.2010 passed in F.A.O. No.105 of 2009 by the Additional
Special Judge (Vigilance)-cum-Additional District Judge, Bhubaneswar.
17.          The Rotary Club of Bhubaneswar Cosmopolitan is a
constituent of Rotary International, the Apex Body. Their affairs are
guided by MoP. The specific case of the appellant is that its membership
has been terminated by the respondents without adhering to procedure
contained in Bye-laws. No material was brought to our notice to show
that   before  terminating   the   membership     of   the   appellant-Club,
opportunity of hearing was provided to the appellant-Club. Termination
of the membership of the appellant-Club has a civil consequence.
Nothing was also brought to our notice as to whether the procedure
provided in the Bye-laws for termination of membership of constituent
Club has been followed before terminating the membership of the
appellant-Club. These basic issues have not been adjudicated by any of
the lower Courts or the learned Single Judge of this Court.
18.          From the orders of the First Appellate Court, it appears that
it has not decided the question of fact and law involved in the case. The
judgment of the First Appellate Court is based on a foundation that the
Civil Court cannot interfere with the internal affairs of the Club. Virtually
the First Appellate Court has not decided anything relating to the merit
of the order passed by the learned trial Court in interim application.

                                      14
Even though such question was raised before the learned Single Judge,
the learned Single Judge has not adjudicated the said issue. As it
appears, learned Single Judge has justified the conclusion drawn by the
First Appellate Court by supplying the reasons to it. The learned Counsel
for the appellant has rightly submitted that while deciding the interim
application, the Court should not decide the dispute like the cause of
action which can only be determined after the evidence is adduced. The
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Surya Dev Rai (supra) has held as
under:
             37. Such like matters frequently arise before the
             High Courts. We sum up our conclusions in a
             nutshell even at the risk of repetition and state the
             same as hereunder:
                          xx           xx          xx
                   (3)    Certiorari, under Article 226 of the
             Constitution is issued for correcting gross errors of
             jurisdiction, i.e., when a subordinate Court is found
             to have acted (i) without jurisdiction – by assuming
             jurisdiction where there exists none, or (ii) in excess
             of its jurisdiction by overlapping or crossing the
             limits of jurisdiction, or (iii) acting in flagrant
             disregard of law or the rules of procedure or acting
             in violation of principles of natural justice where
             there is no procedure specified and thereby
             occasioning failure of justice.
                   (4)    Supervisory jurisdiction under Article
             227 of the Constitution is exercised keeping the
             subordinate Courts within the bounds of their
             jurisdiction. When the subordinate Court has
             assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have or
             has failed to exercised a jurisdiction which it does
             have or the jurisdiction though available is being
             exercised by the Court in a manner not permitted
             by law and failure of justice or grave injustice has

                                     15
             occasioned thereby, the High Court may step in to
             exercise its supervisory jurisdiction.
                          xx                 xx          xx
                   (8)    The High Court in exercise of certiorari
             or supervisory jurisdiction will not covert itself into
             a Court of Appeal and indulge in re-appreciation or
             evaluation of evidence or correct errors in drawing
             inferences or correct errors of mere formal or
             technical character.”
19.          Needless to say that at interlocutory stage, a Court cannot
decide the disputed questions of fact. In the instance case, the claim of
the appellant-Club that its membership has been terminated with
oblique motive on the ground of filing of suit and in spite of interim order
of injunction flouting the judicial order taking advantage of the modified
order without following the procedure contained in the Bye-laws in
compliance with the principles of natural justice. The plea of the
respondents is that they have done it according to the Bye-laws of the
institution and not based on the impugned letter, but based on another
legitimate cause. This rival contention is purely a disputed question of
fact,  which    cannot    be  adjudicated    while  deciding    interlocutory
application without recording evidence. Admittedly, on the date of filing
of the suit, the membership of the appellant-Club had not been
terminated. On the date of passing of preliminary interim modified order
also the membership of the appellant-Club was not terminated. It was
only just after passing the order of modification, the membership of the
Club was terminated on the ground of non-payment of dues. Neither the

                                     16
trial Court nor the First Appellate Court nor the High Court has
considered as to whether on the date of institution of the suit, the
appellant-Club was entitled for an order of an injunction which should
be continued till disposal of the suit. In absence of adjudication of this
basic question, in the interlocutory application which goes to the route of
the case, the orders passed by the trial court, First Appellate Court and
learned Single Judge are not sustainable in law.
20.          Decision    of the    Bombay   High   Court   in   Satyavart
Sidhantalankar v. Arya Samaj, Bom, AIR 1946 Bom 516, has no help
to the respondents as in that case issue before the Bombay High Court
was with regard to competency of an unregistered club to sue and to be
sued. Maintainability issue has not been decided by the trial court. That
issue will be decided in the suit.
21.          In view of the above, judgment of the learned Single Judge
dated 17.3.2011 passed in W.P.(C) No.19826 of 2010 and the order dated
11.10.2010 passed in F.A.O. No.105 of 2009 by the First Appellate Court
and the order dated 19.12.2009 passed in I.A. No.558 of 2008 by the
trial court are set aside.
             The matter is remanded back to the trial court for
consideration of the appellant’s interim application afresh for restoration
of status quo in respect of the membership of the appellant-Club as well
as its prayer for temporary injunction keeping in mind the three
ingredients like prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable

                                                    17
           injury. The trial court while deciding the interim application must take a
           prima facie view as to whether the membership of the appellant-Club has
           been terminated after strictly adhering to the provision of Bye-law
           governing the appellant-Club and respondent-Club and as to whether
           reasonable opportunity of being heard has been afforded to the
           appellant-Club before termination of its membership.
           22.             In the result, the Writ appeal is allowed.
                                                                  ……………………..........
                                                                     B.N.Mahapatra, J.
  V. Gopala Gowda, C.J.                 I agree.
                                                                   …....………………………
