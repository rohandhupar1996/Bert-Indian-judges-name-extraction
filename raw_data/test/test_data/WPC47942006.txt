                             JUDGMENT AND ORDER
                                      (ORAL)
       Heard Ms. M. D. Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard
Mr. A.C. Buragohain, learned Advocate General, Assam, who is assisted by Mr. G.Z.
Ahmed, learned Government Advocate, Assam, appearing for respondent Nos. 1, 2,
3 and 4; and Mr. S. Gogoi, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 5 and 6.
2.     While hearing the case on 18.08.2015, as the learned counsel appearing for
the parties had contended that Assam Panchayat Act, 1994, for short, 1994 Act,
and the Assam Agricultural Produce market Act, 1972, for short, 1972 Act, seem to
be in conflict, Mr. A.C. Buragohain, learned Advocate General, Assam was
requested to address this Court, and accordingly, in deference to the request of the
Court, Mr. Buragohain has advanced his argument to-day.
3.     The writ petitioner is a statutory body constituted under Section 7 of the
1972 Act, named and styled as North-Lakhimpur Regulated Market Committee. By a
Notification dated 21.11.1984, in exercise of power conferred under Section 6 of
the 1972 Act, the Governor of Assam was pleased to declare, amongst others,
Bangalmara as the Principal Market Yard in Lakhimpur Sub-Division covering
declared market place measuring 16 Bigha 0 Katha 11 Lecha as described therein.
The notification also declared the Market Proper in respect of Principal Market Yard
at Bangalmara to be the entire area within a distance of 8 K.M. from the boundary
of the Bangalmara Principal Market Yard including all roads, land with building and
structures thereon.
4.     By a Notification dated 01.10.1996 issued under Section 4(1) and 4(2) of the
1972 Act, the Governor of Assam declared the intention of regulating the purchase
WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                     3
and sale of the agricultural produce as noted therein in all Market Areas declared
under the 1972 Act and invited objections within a period of 30 days. Thereafter,
by a Notification dated 22.12.1999, issued by the Joint Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Agricultural Department in exercise of powers under Section
5(4) of the 1972 Act, amongst others, Lakhimpur Sub-Division was directed to be
read as Lakhimpur District.
5.     At this stage, it would be appropriate to record that Section 6 of the 1972
Act was amended with effect from 30.01.2001 and now the power under Section 6
to declare Market Yards has been vested with the Assam Agricultural Marketing
Board with the approval of the State Government. Materials on record also do not
indicate whether any objection has been received or as to whether the Notification
dated 01.10.1996 still holds the field.
6.     On the strength of the aforesaid Notifications, it is pleaded by the petitioner
that the Market Committee decided to operate a Cattle Market in Bangalmara
Principal Market Yard and a general notice was issued on 20.07.2006 by the
Secretary of the Market committee and informing the cultivators and traders that a
Cattle Market is going to be operated under the aegis and supervision of the Market
Committee on 27.07.2006 in the Principal Market Yard, Bangalmara. It was also
spelt out in the said Notice that no revenue or cess would be levied on the
cultivators. A letter dated 25.07.2006 was issued by the Chief Executive Officer,
Lakhimpur Zilla Parishad directing the Secretary of the Market Committee not to
start operation of the Cattle Market as no Cattle Market can be operated within a
periphery of 200 Metres from the weekly market settled by Lakhimpur Zilla
Parishad. It is stated that after completion of successful operation of the Cattle
Market, the Market Committee received a letter dated 02.08.2006 from the Circle
WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                       4
Officer, Bihpuria Revenue Circle, Bihpuria, to maintain status-quo in respect of
operation of Cattle Market. A WT Message dated 09.08.2006 from the Deputy
Commissioner, Lakhimpur was also received. By the said WT Message, parties were
directed to maintain status-quo in respect of Cattle Market. The Secretary of the
Market Committee submitted a letter to the Deputy Commissioner, Lakhimpur on
19.08.2006 on the aforesaid subject and asserting that the Market Committee was
entitled to operate the Cattle Market within its declared Market Area. However, as
no action was taken by the Deputy Commissioner, Lakhimpur, the writ petition was
filed challenging the WT Message dated 09.08.2006 and the order dated
02.08.2006, Annexures– 6 and 7, respectively, of the writ petition and for a writ of
mandamus directing the respondents to allow the petitioner to operate the Cattle
Market at Bangalmara.
7.     In the affidavit filed by the respondent No. 4, it is stated that the Cattle
Market is settled by the Lakhimpur Zilla Parishad at Bangalmara in terms of 1994
Act. It is further stated that during the existence of more than 20 years Market
Committee neither provided any facilities to the agriculturists nor established any
market and relied on, in this context, a report of the Circle Officer, Bihpuria
Revenue Circle dated 08.08.2006. It is also stated that Market Committee also
charged Rs. 25/- from the agriculturists for each cattle and forcibly dragged the
agriculturists to its Cattle Market.
8.     Respondent No. 5, who is a settlement holder under the Lakhimpur Zilla
Parishad, also relied on the report of the Circle Officer, Bihpuria dated 08.08.2006
and stated that infrastructure is totally lacking in the Market Yard. It is also pleaded
that the Market Committee wanted to set up a Cattle Market hardly 100 Metres
away from the existing weekly market at Bangalmara. It is highlighted that 1972
WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                        5
Act does not confer any power on the Market Committee to settle/establish weekly
market. By an additional affidavit-in-opposition, the respondent No. 5 pleaded that
Section 5(2) of the 1972 Act cannot be applied to Bangalmara Weekly Cattle Market
as the sellers are themselves producers and the buyers purchased, on retail, their
cattle for their own consumption and use.
9.      Though no reply-affidavit has been filed by the writ petitioner, an “affidavit-
in-addition” was filed giving, amongst others, a list of arrival of specified
agricultural produce, namely, buffalo, goat, betel-nut, rice, paddy, jute, cattle in the
Market Area in the year 2012-2013. It is stated that despite the interim order of
this Court enabling the Market Committee to carry on the Cattle Market, operation
of the Cattle Market had been stalled due to law and order situation created by the
lessee of the Zilla Parishad. It is also highlighted in the said affidavit that there are
21 employees of the Board apart from 5 employees of the regulated market and
they are depending for their salaries on revenue generation through the Cattle
Market. It is asserted that Bangalmara is a wholesale market and there are 23 Nos.
of retail markets and 9 wholesale markets, totaling 32 Nos. of markets in the
District and under the Bangalmara Principal Market Yard, there are 4 Sub-Market
Yards.    It is also stated that facilities are available for operation of the Cattle
Market.
10.     Ms. M.D. Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
1972 Act was enacted to provide better regulation of buying and selling of
agricultural produce and it is in tune with the objective of the 1972 Act that the
petitioner wanted to operate a Cattle Market. She has submitted that the impugned
orders are wholly illegal and arbitrary and the Market Committee is entitled under
the law to operate the Cattle Market. Drawing attention of the Court to Section 54
WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                     6
of the 1972 Act, the learned counsel submits that even if any market is set up or
established in pursuance of the 1994 Act or any other law for the time being in
force, no provision of any enactment shall apply to any Market Area or affect the
powers of the Market Committee in setting up and establishing a market. She has
also, in this connection, drawn attention to Section 5(2) of the 1994 Act to contend
that no person or authority can set up, establish or continue to operate a market
after publication of a Notification under Section 5(1) declaring an area to be the
Market Area. It is submitted by her that as Bangalmara has been declared to be the
Principal Market Yard, and as the Cattle Market is within the aforesaid Market Yard,
Panchayat or any other authority cannot set up a Market within the vicinity of 8
K.M. from the Bangalmara Principal Market Yard in terms of the Notification dated
21.11.1984. It is also contended that the Market Committee collected cess from the
Bangalmara Weekly Market as per Rule 23(1) of the Assam Agricultural Produce
Market (General) Rules, 1975, for short, 1975 Rules. Reliance has also been placed
upon Sections 13, 14, 15 and 21 of the 1972 Act to buttress the contentions. It is
also submitted, though not stated in the writ petition, that a resolution was
adopted by the Market Committee before issuance of the Notice dated 20.07.2006
(Annexure–V). It is further submitted by Ms. Choudhury that the Cattle Market
proposed to be set up by the Notice dated 20.07.2006 is not a retail market but a
wholesale market.
11.     Mr. S. Gogoi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 5 and 6
submits that Section 5(3) of the 1972 Act provides that notwithstanding declaration
of a Market Area, purchase and sale of agricultural produce in a retail sale is
excluded and that in terms of Section 2(xxx) of the 1972 Act, what quantity
constitutes retail sale has not been specified and unless such quantity of retail sale
WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                        7
is fixed, having regard to the fact that the Act pertains to wholesale purchase and
sale, the petitioner cannot prohibit sale and purchase in a market established under
the 1994 Act when evidently no such market was set up by the petitioner since its
inception in the year 1984.
12.     Mr. A.C. Buragohain, learned Advocate General, Assam has submitted that
there is no conflict between 1972 Act and 1994 Act and markets can be operated,
both by the Market Committees established under the 1972 Act as well as by the
Panchayat authorities under the 1994 Act subject to the condition that 1972 Act is
applicable in respect of wholesale purchase of sale and purchase of agricultural
produce while 1994 Act would apply only to retail sales and, therefore, both can co-
exist within their respective spheres. Mr. Buragohain has drawn the attention of the
Court to Section 2(xvi), (xvii), (xviii), (xix), (xxvi), (xxx) as well as Rule 16 of the
1975 Rules. It is submitted that the petitioner has not produced any document to
show the limit of retail sale which has to be fixed by the Market Committee in the
bye-laws of the Committee and in absence of any such fixation, having regard to
the object of the 1972 Act, the Panchayat authorities cannot be restrained from
operating their market.
13.      I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties
and have perused the materials on record.
14.      At the outset, it will be appropriate to take note of the relevant provisions of
the 1972 Act and the 1975 Rules. For better appreciation, they are reproduced
hereinbelow:

           functioning is unable to undertake regulated trading in that commodity
           because of its peculiar nature:
                    Provided that not more than one Market Committee shall be
           established within the same market area or a part thereof for the same
           type of agricultural produce.

WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                       14
15.    The statement of objects and reasons of the enactment of 1972 Act goes to
show that the Act was enacted to facilitate marketing activities by providing fair
opportunities, both to the buyers and sellers, to strike bargain and to complete
transactions. The Act aims to provide for better regulation of buying and selling of
agricultural produce and the establishment of markets for agricultural produce in
the State of Assam.
16.    The provisions extracted hereinabove go to show that the Government by
issuing notification may declare its intention of exercising control over purchase and
sale of agricultural produce in a specified area and invite objections and, after
considering the objections, if any, received within the time stipulated, declare a
Market Area. Market means a regulated market established under the 1972 Act for
the Market Area declared as such under Section 5, which includes a Market Proper,
a Principal Market Yard, etc. For each Market Area, establishment of a Market
Committee is visualized. The functions, powers and duties of the Market Committee
are also delineated.
17.    Section 2 (xxx) mandates that sale of any agricultural produce not exceeding
such quantity to be known as ‘retail sale’ shall have to be fixed by bye-laws or rules
in respect of such agricultural produce.
18.    Section 5(2) provides that after declaration of Market Area, notwithstanding
anything contained in any law for the time being in force, no local authority or
other person shall, within the Market Area or within a distance thereof to be
notified in the official gazette, set up, establish or continue to use, any place for the
purchase or sale of any notified agricultural produce.
19.    Section 5(3) of the 1972 Act, however, provides that nothing in Section 5(2)
shall apply to purchase and sale of such agricultural produce if the producer of such

                                                                                    15
produce is himself its seller and the purchaser is a person, who purchases such
produce for his own private consumption or if such agricultural produce is sold by a
retail sale to a person who purchases such produce for his own private
consumption.
20.    A reading of Section 5(2) and 5(3) of the 1972 Act would go to show that
notwithstanding declaration of Market Area, there is no bar to set up, establish or
continue a market where retail sale takes place. To put it differently, 1972 Act does
not apply to retail sale. Therefore, it is imperative to fix quantity of any specified
agricultural produce which can be sold as a retail sale. Section 7 of 1972 Act
provides that it shall be the duty of the Market Committee to enforce the provisions
of the Act and the Rules and bye-laws framed there under in the jurisdictional
Market Area.
21.    Section 50 of the 1972 Act provides that subject to any Rules made by the
State Government under Section 49, the Market Committee may, in respect of the
agricultural produce and the Market Area under its management, make bye-laws
and from time to time alter and rescind the same.
22.    Section 54 is a savings provision, which only reiterates that nothing
contained in the 1994 Act or any other law for time being in force relating to the
establishment, maintenance and regulation of a market shall apply to any Market
Area or affect in any way, the powers of the Market Committee or the rights of a
holder of a licence granted under Sub-Section (2) of Section 13. The provision does
not override Section 5(3).
23.    Rule 16(1) provides that all agricultural produce brought into the market for
sale shall be sold by open auction in the Principal or Sub-Market Yard. Rule 16(2)
WP(C) No. 4794 of 2006

                                                                                    16
provides that Rule 16(1) will not apply to a retail sale as may be specified in bye-
laws of the market committee.
24.    On a specific query of the Court, learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that she is not aware whether any bye-laws have been framed by the Market
Committee or whether retail sale had been fixed by the bye-laws or by any rule.
25.    Even though the petition is pending for last 9 years, the petitioner has not
placed any document on record to indicate as to whether any quantity has been
fixed defining retail sale. The petitioner has pointed out in the pleadings that it
could not operate the Cattle Market due to law and order situation. The Market
Committee cannot encroach upon retail sale. It will be obligatory on the part of the
Market Committee to first determine retail sale which will draw the dividing line for
running of any market within the Market Area by any other authority or person and
the Market Committee constituted under the 1972 Act.
26.    In view of the discussions above, it will be difficult to accede to the prayers
made in the writ petition, and accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. The
petitioner Market Committee may take appropriate steps as enjoined in law to
effectuate the objectives of the 1972 Act.
27.    No cost.
                                                                 JUDGE
