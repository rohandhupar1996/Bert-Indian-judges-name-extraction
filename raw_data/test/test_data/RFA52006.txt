                    JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL )
         This first appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated
10.08.2005 passed by the learned District Judge, Dhemaji whereby Title Suit No.
8/2003 instituted by the present appellant was dismissed in entirety.
2.       The present appellant, as plaintiffs, instituted Title Suit No. 8/2003 in the
Court of learned District Judge, Dhemaji on 20.08.2003 stating that the land
described in schedule to the plaint measuring 13 bigha 12 lecha originally
belonged to one Horomohan Boro of village Pub Baligaon. Predecessor of the
plaintiffs, Joydev Medhi being a friend of the original owner Horomohan Boro
offered to purchase that land from him and as Horomohan Boro also wanted to
leave the village, the whole of the land was sold to Joydev Medhi on realisation
of a sum of Rs. 1,200/- and thereafter Horomohan Boro shifted to village Nalbari
and purchased 17 bigha of land at a sum of Rs. 700/- out of the sale proceeds of
his land in the village Pub Baligaon. The predecessor of the plaintiffs occupied
the whole land and started living there but the family of the original owner
remained in the place by amicable settlement with Joydev Medhi. Horomohan
Boro, however, did not execute any sale deed to the plaintiffs on this or that plea
stating that he was not in a position of a pattadar of the land. Be that as it may,
in the year 1979, Horomohan Boro instituted Title Suit No. 8/79 in the Court of
learned Munsiff, Dhemaji, inter alia, for recovery of 2 bigha 1 katha 12 lecha of
land from Joydev Medhi. Joydev Medhi appeared and contested the suit and
ultimately the suit was dismissed for default and it was neither restored nor was
an appeal preferred there-against. The order dated 22.12.1979 attained finality.
                                                                            Page 4 of 10
RFA 5 of 2006

It is the further case of the plaintiffs that their predecessor continued possessing
the land till it was discovered that the defendants of the suit got mutation in their
favour over 13 bigha 12 lecha of land purchased by Joydev Medhi from
Horomohan Boro and so submitted objection to the Revenue Authority for
cancelation of mutation. The application was dismissed and an appeal was
preferred there-against before Assam Board of Revenue which was also
dismissed. There was a writ petition challenging the order passed by the
Revenue Board and when the same was pending, the plaintiffs came to know
about the execution of a sale deed by Horomohan Boro in favour of the
defendants and so instituted the suit for declaration that the said sale deed
bearing registration No. 158/85 purported to be made in favour of the
defendants was fraudulent, forged and illegal, for cancellation of the mutation of
the names of defendants and also for declaration of right, title and interest over
the suit land described in Schedule ‘C’ to the plaint which is a part of Schedule ‘B’
land described in the plaint.
3.       On being summoned, the defendants appeared and submitted written
statement and claimed to have purchased the suit land by valid registered sale
deed from Horomohan Boro on the basis of which their names were duly
mutated in the Records of Rights. Upon perusal of the rival contentions of the
parties, the learned trial court framed the following issues and allowed the
parties to lead respective evidence for proving their respective cases.
                  i.     Whether the sale ded No. 158/85 serial No. 426/85 of Dhemaji
                         Sub Registry was a fabricated and forged document?
                  ii.    Whether the mutation of the names of the defendant No. 1 on
                         the basis of the alleged fabricated and forged document is liable
                         to be cancelled?
                                                                             Page 5 of 10
RFA 5 of 2006

                  iii.  Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for declaration fo
                        title over the suit land as described in schedule ‘B’ of the plaint?
                  iv.   Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for declaration of
                        title and confirmation of possession in respect of the land
                        described in Schedule ‘C’ of the plaint?
                  v.    Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for declaration fo
                        title and recovery of khas possession of the land described in the
                        schedule ‘B’ of the plaint?
                  vi.   Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for a declaration
                        that the defendant No. 13 is not entitled to the land measuring 1
                        bigha 2 katha 10 lecha part of Dag No. 131 of Chandue Village?
                  vii.  Any other relief(s) to which the parties are entitled to?
4.       Plaintiff examined as many as 6 witnesses and exhibited 4 documents
while defendants examined 5 witnesses and exhibited 2 documents, namely, Ext.
Ka and Ext. Kha. Ext. Kha is the registered sale deed No. 158/85 whereas Ext. Ka
is the compromise deed executed by Horomohan Boro in favour of Joydev Medhi
which is counter signed by village elders. The defendants have also exhibited
some Revenue Paying Receipts. The learned trial court after considering the
materials available on record, arrived at the finding that the registered sale deed
No. 158/85 was allegedly executed by Horomohan Boro in favour of the
defendants and the plaintiffs or their predecessor were not party to it and so,
being a third party he was not entitled to question validity or otherwise of the
said sale deed. The learned trial court further arrived at the finding that the
plaintiffs having claimed decree for right, title and interest with respect to the
suit land on the basis of alleged purchase from Horomohan Boro, the said vendor
or on his death his legal representatives were the necessary parties and in
absence of them, the suit was not maintainable. However, the learned trial court
after consideration of Ext. Kha, executed by the defendants, held that the
dismissal of the Title Suit No. 8/79 was for default and so, it was a dismissal
                                                                                  Page 6 of 10
RFA 5 of 2006

against both the parties. Consequently, it was held by the learned trial court that
plaintiffs are not in possession of any plot of land even over 2 bigha 12 lecha of
land borne out by Ext. Kha and exhibited by defendants. With these findings, the
suit of the plaintiff was dismissed in entirety. Aggrieved, plaintiffs have preferred
this first appeal challenging the impugned judgment and decree and also
claiming right, title and interest with respect to the suit land measuring 13 bigha
12 lecha.
5.       I have heard Mr. BD Goswami assisted by Mr. S Sharma for the appellant
and Mr. I Hussain, learned counsel for the respondents. I have also perused the
respective pleadings of the parties and the evidence adduced by them. The
plaintiffs claimed right, title and interest with respect to 13 bigha 12 lecha of land
described in schedule to the plaint on the basis of purchase from Horomohan
Boro. But in support of such purchase admittedly the plaintiff could not produce
any title. Sale within the meaning of section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act in
respect of all immovable property can be done by an instrument which is
compulsorily registrible under section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, provided
its value is above Rs. 100/-. Admittedly, the consideration for purchase in the
present case was Rs. 1,200/-. The plaintiffs stated that Horomohan Boro did not
execute any sale deed. This being the position, no sale within the meaning of
section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act can be said to have taken place in
favour of the plaintiffs. Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act not only
defines the same but also lays down the procedure for effecting sale. It is
provided that in case of tangible immovable property of a value of rupees one
hundred and above, such transfer may be made by a registered instrument.
                                                                           Page 7 of 10
RFA 5 of 2006

However, in case of tangible immovable property of value less than Rs. 100/- it
can be done either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the property.
Plaintiffs claimed that price of the land was Rs. 1,200/- and so the question of
sale by delivery of possession could not have arisen. Purchase from Horomohan
Boro is the fulcrum of the case of the plaintiffs and unless and until the purchase
is established, the suit of the plaintiffs is destined to fail. One of the grounds for
which the learned trial court refused to decree the suit of the plaintiffs is that
plaintiffs could not prove purchase in accordance with law. Having gone through
the pleadings of the parties and the evidence on record, such finding of the
learned trial court that no sale on receipt of Rs. 1,200/- had taken place in favour
of the predecessor of the plaintiffs appears to be correct and accordingly that
finding of the learned trial court cannot be interfered with.
6.       But while considering the evidence led by the parties, it comes to light
that defendant while exhibiting their purchase deed as Ext. Kha also exhibited a
compromise deed as Ext. Ka and the same is available on record. Ext. Ka was
executed between Horomohan Boro on one side and Joydev Medhi and
Phanindra Medhi on the other side. This compromise petition was prepared for
filing in Title Suit No. 8/79 which was instituted by Horomohan Boro to recover
possession of 2 bigha 12 lecha of land from Joydev Medhi. Institution of Title Suit
No. 8/79 in the Court of learned Munsiff at Dhemaji by none other than
Horomohan Boro against Joydev Medhi goes to show that Joydev Medhi was in
possession of the land as on the date of institution of the suit and Horomohan
Boro wanted to recover the same. During pendency of the suit, Ext. Ka
compromise deed was executed in presence of the village elders and thereupon
                                                                            Page 8 of 10
RFA 5 of 2006

Horomohan Boro accepted possession of Joydev Medhi over 2 bigha 12 lecha of
land. Thereafter neither parties appeared in the title suit because of which Title
Suit No. 8/79 was dismissed for default on 22.12.1979. After the suit was
dismissed for default, the same was not restored in exercise of power under
Order IX Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs of that suit, namely,
Title Suit No. 8/79 thereby became barred for institution of the fresh suit against
the defendant of that suit. This shows that Horomohan Boro and for that his
successors in interest including the transferee and assigns became precluded
from instituting any suit with respect to recovery of possession over 2 bigha 12
lecha of land from Joydev Medhi and Joydev Medhi continued possessing the
same in exercise of possessory right. Question as to whether Joydev Medhi have
acquired title with respect to that land from Horomohan Boro or his legal heirs is
altogether a different one. Under such circumstances, the finding of the learned
trial court that plaintiffs were not in possession of any part of the land cannot be
supported or upheld. Consequently, the appeal is disposed of. The findings of the
learned trial court in regard to non-maintainability of the suit is upheld but the
finding of the learned trial court in regard to possession of the plaintiffs over any
part of the 13 bigha 12 lecha of land is hereby set aside.
7.      Send down the records.
8.      No order as to costs.
