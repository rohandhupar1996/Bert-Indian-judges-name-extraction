                              -Versus-
     Executive Engineer,

            For petitioner      :    M/s.A.Mohanty, P.R.Dash, T.Rath
                                     & J.Sahu
            For O.Ps.           :    M/s.R.N.Acharya, B. Baug & A.Mishra
               THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH
     Date of hearing : 27.07.201     &   Date of Judgment : 09.08.2017
Biswanath Rath, J. Petitioner claiming to be continuing as a N.M.R.
     employee under the S.D.O., Kulunga involving the Executive
     Engineer, Rajgangpur Electrical Division filed the writ petition
     seeking direction for considering his case for regularization and
     equal pay for equal work.
     2.                 Short fact involved in the case at hand is that the
     petitioner was appointed initially as a casual labourer on 1.10.1986,
     and subsequently enrolled as an N.M.R. in the year 1988 and
     claimed to be working as such till date of filing of the writ petition. It
     is claimed that the Department prepared two separate lists of casual
     labourer on 1.7.1987 and the other on 1.4.1988 respectively
     enrolling the casual labourer as N.M.Rs. those who were counting

                                    2
as casual labourer along with the petitioner. It is alleged that in
spite of preparation of two separate lists of N.M.Rs., the Executive
Engineer only regularized the N.M.Rs. enrolled as on 1.7.1987 and
did not regularise the petitioner. It is claimed that the petitioner has
an unblemished career and looking to the provision to regularise the
N.M.Rs., whosoever has completed 400 days, were required to be
regularised. It is further alleged that even though petitioner was
placed at serial no.17 in the list initially but entering into a
correction, his position in the list has been subsequently altered
and shown at the bottom of the list at 47 finds place at pages 11 &
12 of the writ petition respectively. Petitioner claimed that there is
sufficient work with the opposite parties and there was no occasion
for not regularizing the petitioner. Further by the deliberate change
in the serial number of the petitioner in spite of his working for
more than 400 days by the particular date, his case has been
deliberately discriminated.     It is   further  alleged  that   in  the
meantime, vide Annexure-4, there is again listing of names of
persons working as N.M.R. who have completed more than 400 days
as on 1.10.1991. In the process, though the authority regularised a
number of candidates similar to that of the petitioner completed 400
days as on 1.10.91 but the petitioner has been once again
discriminated. Petitioner claiming to have been discriminated in the
matter of regularisation by filing the writ petition claimed for a
direction for considering his case for regularization and also for
payment equal pay for equal work.

                                     3
3.                  Sri R.N.Acharya, learned counsel appearing for
the opposite parties referring to their counter submitted that the
claim of the petitioner that he was working as an N.M.R. with effect
from 1.10.1986 was false. He was rather working under a gang
leader from 1.10.1986 to 31.3.1988. By detailing the working of the
petitioner as N.M.R. on different spells, Sri Acharya, learned counsel
for the O.Ps. claimed that not only the petitioner did not complete
400 days as on the cut off date but was not even in service of the
O.Ps. Sri Acharya, learned counsel for the O.Ps. claimed that the
petitioner is not entitled to claim for regularization and equal pay. In
paragraph-8 of the counter, the opposite parties objected the claim
of the petitioner on the premises that though the petitioner had
completed 400 days as on 1.10.1991 but his case could not be
considered for regularization only on the premises that he was not
on the roll of the opposite parties when the particular batch was
considered for regulation, Sri Acharya thus seriously objected the
claim of the petitioner on both count.
4.                  It appears that the petitioner answering the
opponent’s claim that he is not in the roll of the opposite parties in
employment filing a rejoinder claimed that he was in employment as
on date of filing of the writ petition.
5.                  During course of argument, Sri Dash made a fair
statement that the petitioner was disengaged in spite of an interim
protection granted by this Court and as such claimed that non-
engagement of the petitioner at a subsequent stage is only an
attempt to keep the petitioner away from the grant of relief.

                                    4
Opposite parties in response to the affidavit by the petitioner filed a
further affidavit where they have made a categoric statement that
petitioner’s name initially though found place at serial no.17 of the
list but as it was an inadvertent one, on verification of actual facts,
his position has been shifted to 47. It is thus claimed that there was
no defect in the correction of the list. Opposite parties reiterating
the stand taken earlier submitted that though the petitioner
completed 400 days of work by 1.10.91 but he could not be
regularised for his not continuing with the employer by the time
persons similarly situated were considered for regularization by the
opposite parties.
6.                 Considering the pleadings in the writ petition, the
counter, the affidavit of the petitioner, the additional affidavit of the
opposite parties and the rejoinder by the petitioner as well, this
Court finds that there is no dispute that the petitioner was already
included in the list of N.M.R. completed 400 days as on 1.1.87 but
finding inclusion of the name of the petitioner in the list of persons
completed 400 days as illegal and not based on actual facts,
petitioner’s name was subsequently included in the subsequent list
prepared as on 1.10.91. It is observed here that petitioner did not
challenge inclusion of his name once again in the list prepared
taking into consideration of completion of 400 days as on 1.10.91. It
is also found that the services of the petitioner could not be
regularised on account of the fact that he was not in the roll when
the N.M.R. batch prepared in 1991 was taken up for consideration.
This Court thus observes that in spite of petitioner coming to know

                                   5
that he is not in roll of the employer at a particular point of time,
the petitioner has not taken any step for amendment of the writ
petition. As the petitioner was not on the roll of employer, this Court
finds, no direction for regularization of the petitioner can be issued
at this stage. This Court only makes an observation that in the
event the petitioner is not in employment and has not attended the
age of superannuation, it is open to him to submit a representation
for the consideration of the O.Ps. for any temporary engagement.
7.                 The writ petition thus stands dismissed for having
no merit but with the observation made herein above.
                                           ………………………….
                                            Biswanath Rath, J.
