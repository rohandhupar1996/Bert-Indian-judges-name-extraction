          PRESENT :
                               THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE S.C. PARIJA
          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Date of Judgment: 07.02.2018
          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S.C. Parija, J.            These two writ petitions have come up before me by way
          of a reference, in view of the difference of opinion between the two
          learned Judges of the Division Bench. The question which needs to be
          answered in this reference is whether after fixing minimum qualifying
          marks in the written examination, the High Court was justified in
          fixing minimum qualifying marks for the interview and whether such
          fixation was in accordance with the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme
          Court contained in paragraph 207.9 of the judgment in Brij
          Mohanlal v. Union of India and others (2012) 6 SCC 502.
          2.               Paragraph 207.9 of the judgment in Brij Mohanlal (supra)
          reads as under:-
                       “207.9. All the persons who have been appointed by way
                       of direct recruitment from the Bar as Judges to preside
                       over FTCs under the FTC Scheme shall be entitled to be
                       appointed to the regular cadre of the Higher Judicial
                       Services of the respective States only in the following
                       manner:
                           (a)   The direct recruits to FTCs who opt for
                                 regularization shall take a written examination
                                 to be conducted by the High Courts of the
                                 respective States for determining their
                                 suitability for absorption in the regular cadre
                                 of Additional District Judges.

                           3
(b) Therefore, they shall be subjected to an
     interview by a Selection Committee consisting
     of the Chief Justice and four senior most
     Judges of that High Court.
(c) There shall be 150 marks for the written
     examination and 100 marks for the interview.
     The qualifying marks shall be 40% aggregate
     for    general   candidates     and   35%     for
     SC/ST/OBC candidates. The examination and
     interview shall be held in accordance with the
     relevant Rules enacted by the States for direct
     appointment to Higher Judicial Services.
(d) Each of the appointees shall be entitled to one
     mark per year of service in the FTCs, which
     shall form part of the interview marks.
(e) Needless to point out that this examination and
     interview should be conducted by the
     respective High Courts keeping in mind that all
     these applicants have put in a number of years
     as FTC Judges and have served the country by
     administering justice in accordance with law.
     The written examination and interview module,
     should, thus, be framed keeping in mind the
     peculiar facts and circumstances of these
     cases.
(f) The candidates who qualify the written
     examination       and     obtain    consolidated
     percentage     as    aforeindicated   shall    be
     appointed to the post of Additional District
     Judge in the regular cadre of the State.
(g) If, for any reason, vacancies are not available in
     the regular cadre, we hereby direct the State
     Governments to create such additional
     vacancies as may be necessary keeping in view
     the number of candidates selected.
(h) All sitting and/or former FTC Judges who were
     directly appointed from the Bar and are
     desirous of taking the examination and
     interview for regular appointment shall be

                                      4
                 given age relaxation. No application shall be
                 rejected on the ground of age of the applicant
                 being in excess of the prescribed age.”
3.          The challenge in these two writ petitions before the
Division Bench was with regard to the notice dated 06.12.2012,
issued by the High Court of Orissa as an addendum, indicating
therein that the written examination shall consist of two papers of
150 marks, each carrying 75 marks, and that the qualifying marks
shall be 40% aggregate for general candidates and 35% for SC/ST &
OBC candidates in each paper, and that the interview shall carry 100
marks and the qualifying marks in the interview for both the general
and SC/ST and OBC candidates shall be 40% and each of the
appointees shall be entitled to one mark per year of service in Fast
Tract Courts, which shall be added to the interview mark. The written
examination was scheduled to be held on 16.12.2012.
4.          The grievance of the writ petitioners was that the
impugned notice fixing qualifying marks of 40% for general candidates
and 35% for SC/ST/OBC candidates in each paper of the written
examination and the qualifying mark of 40% in the interview for both
the categories of candidates are contrary guidelines laid down by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph 207.9 of its judgment in Brij
Mohanlal (supra).

                                       5
5.          Considering the guidelines prescribed by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in paragraph 207.9 of the judgment in Brij Mohanlal
(supra), as detailed above, Hon’ble Justice B.K. Nayak has come to
find as under:-
            “(i) In the matter of written test and viva voce test, the
                  High Court is competent to follow the relevant
                  Rules governing the procedure for direct
                  recruitment to Higher Judicial Service (District
                  Judge Cadre) to the extent the Rule is not
                  inconsistent with the directions contained in
                  paragraph-207.9 of the said judgment;
                          Therefore, the High Court is competent to
                  specify qualifying marks for the written
                  examination. This is clear from clause (f) of
                  paragraph-207.9 of the judgment, which signifies
                  that a candidate shall be called to interview only if
                  he secures qualifying marks in the written
                  examination and shall be given appointment only
                  if he secures the consolidated aggregate
                  percentage of marks, in both the written test and
                  interview taken together as indicated in clause (c)
                  of the said paragraph of the judgment depending
                  on his caste;
            (ii)  Once a particular percentage of qualifying mark is
                  prescribed for the written test, the High Court
                  cannot prescribe a minimum percentage of
                  qualifying mark for the interview, which taken
                  together with the qualifying marks prescribed for
                  the written test would be more than the aggregate
                  percentage of marks which has been indicated in
                  clause (c) of paragraph-207.9 of the judgment;
                  and
            (iii) Fixing qualifying marks for the written test as well
                  as viva voce test, which together works out to an
                  aggregate of more than 40% or 35% as the case
                  may be depending upon the caste of the

                                     6
                candidate, would run contrary to the direction of
                the Hon’ble Supreme Court.”
6.         On the basis of the above analysis, Hon’ble Justice B.K.
Nayak has come to hold as under:-
              “13.      Once the minimum aggregate qualifying
              marks in the written papers have been prescribed
              at 40% or 35% as the case may be depending
              upon the caste of the candidate, a further
              direction in clause (iii) of the notice under
              Annexure-7 that the candidate must secure 40%
              of marks out of 100 in the interview is wholly
              contrary to the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme
              Court in clause (c) of paragraph-207.9 of the
              judgment in Brij Mohan Lal-(2) (supra). The
              Hon’ble Court’s direction that a general candidate
              securing    aggregate    marks    of   40%      and
              SC/ST/OBC candidate securing 35% of marks in
              aggregate both in written test and interview shall
              be selected, cannot be followed where prescription
              in the advertisement is of minimum qualifying
              marks for both the written test as well as the
              interview taken together exceeds the minimum
              aggregate qualifying marks stipulated by the
              Hon’ble Supreme Court for selection. Therefore,
              fixing of 40% of qualifying marks in the interview
              in the notice under Annexure-7 is bad and illegal
              and the same is hereby quashed. In case the
              aggregate qualifying marks fixed for written test in
              the advertisement added with whatever marks
              secured in the interview aggregates to 40% for
              general candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC
              candidates, such candidates are bound to be
              selected.”
7.         On a perusal of the judgment under reference it is seen
that Hon’ble Justice D.P. Choudhury has differed with the views

                                        7
expressed by Hon’ble Justice B.K.Nayak with regard to the fixing of
minimum qualifying marks of 40%, which is required to be secured by
a candidate in the interview, in order to be eligible for selection.
Findings of his Lordship in this regard is extracted below:-
                “28.      From the aforesaid OSJS & OJS Rule, it
                is clear that there are 200 marks in written
                examination and 30 marks in interview. The
                candidate who has secured 50% of marks in each
                of the written paper shall be called for the
                interview and a minimum 40% of marks shall be
                secured in the interview to be included in the
                merit list. As per the directive of the Hon’ble
                Supreme Court 200 marks for the written
                examination have been reduced to 150 marks and
                the interview marks have been raised to 100
                marks. Moreover, there is no any aggregate marks
                to be secured in the written examination under
                the Rules whereas the aggregate marks of 40% for
                General candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC
                candidates have been prescribed by the directive
                of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Without
                prescribing any mark for the interview specifically
                their Lordships directed to follow the OSJS & OJS
                Rule so far as the interview and the written
                examination are concerned for direct recruitment
                to the post of District Judges. Where the
                minimum mark for interview is not specifically
                mentioned but directive is made to follow the
                OSJS & OJS Rule, obviously their Lordships have
                directed to follow the Recruitment Rules by
                keeping the minimum marks in the interview for
                the candidates who qualify in the written
                examination by keeping such consolidated
                aggregate marks in both the papers. The directive
                in this regard is clearly inferred from the directive
                of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Clauses (a) (b) (c)
                and (e) of para 207.9.”

                                       8
8.           Accordingly,    Hon’ble  Justice  D.P.   Choudhury    has
proceeded to hold as under:-
                     “36. From the aforesaid discussions, I am of
                the view that Clause (ii) of Annexure-7 being not
                in compliance to the directive of the Hon’ble Apex
                Court in Brij Mohan case (supra), asking 40% in
                aggregate for general candidates and 35% for
                SC/ST/OBC candidates in each paper is illegal
                and improper in part. Hence, same is liable to be
                quashed by deleting the words “in each paper”
                and the Court do so. It is further directed that
                both the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.2870 of 2013
                and W.P.(C) NO.3025 of 2013 having obtained the
                minimum aggregate written examination marks
                are allowed to appear in the interview. But Clause
                (iii) of Annexure-7 being in consonance with the
                directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the
                OSJS & OJS Rule issued for direct recruitment to
                the cadre of District Judges is legal and proper
                and same cannot be interfered. Even if Clause (ii)
                of Annexure-7 is quashed by this order, it shall
                not affect the District Judges who have already
                been appointed.”
9.           From the above, it is apparent that Hon’ble Justice D.P.
Choudhury has differed with the views of Hon’ble Justice B.K. Nayak
only with regard to the fixation of minimum qualifying marks of 40%
for the interview, on the ground that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has
not prescribed any mark for the interview and the Hon’ble Court
having directed to follow the relevant recruitment Rules, which in this
case is the Orissa Superior Judicial Service and Orissa Judicial
Service Rules, 2007 (“the Rules” for short), a candidate is required to

                                       9
secure the minimum 40% marks in the interview, as has been
prescribed under the said Rules, in order to be eligible for selection.
10.          It is surprising that the Rule with regard to the necessity
of a candidate securing 40% in each of the written papers, as per the
impugned notice, having been found to be not in conformity with the
guidelines laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph
207.9 of its judgment in Brij Mohanlal (supra), how the other part of
the same notice, prescribing minimum 40% marks in the interview
can be upheld. This is more so, when the Hon’ble Supreme Court has
clearly indicated in sub-para (c) of paragraph 207.9 that there shall
be 150 marks for written examination and 100 marks for the
interview and the qualifying mark will be 40% aggregate for general
candidates and 35% for SC/ST/OBC candidates. The observation of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in sub-para (c) of paragraph 207.9 that
the examination and the interview shall be held in accordance with
the relevant Rules would only imply that the procedure for holding the
written examination and interview is required to be conducted in
accordance with the relevant Rules and not the minimum qualifying
marks prescribed under the said Rules. Further, in sub-para (f) of
paragraph 207.9 of the judgment, Hon’ble Supreme Court has
directed that candidates who qualify in the written examination and
obtain consolidated percentage of 40% and 35%, as the case may be,
shall be appointed as Additional District Judge in the regular cadre of
the State.

                                      10
11.          The aforesaid directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court is
amply clear that a candidate working as Judge under the FTC Scheme
who secures the qualifying marks in aggregate, both in the written
examination and interview taken together, shall be appointed to the
regular cadre of Higher Judicial Service. The words “aggregate” and
“consolidated” means taken as one unit or combined and therefore,
there is no scope for any doubt or ambiguity with regard to the usage
of said two words in sub-paras (c) and (f) of paragraph 207.9 of
judgment as indicated above, which needs any interpretation.
12.           Moreover, the very object and purpose of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in prescribing a specific guidelines for recruitment of
persons working as Judges under the FTC Scheme to be appointed to
the regular cadre of Higher Judicial Service was laid down keeping in
mind the fact that the said Judges have put in several years of service
as FTC Judges and have served the country by administering justice
in accordance with law. Accordingly, Hon’ble Supreme Court had
directed that while framing written examination and interview
module, the aforesaid facts be borne in mind. Therefore, Hon’ble
Supreme Court intended that the existing recruitment Rules for
appointment to Higher Judicial Service is not to be made applicable to
the FTC Judges and a separate module be framed for them, keeping
in view the guidelines and directions laid down in paragraph 207.9 of
the judgment in Brij Mohanlal (supra).

                                      11
13.           For the reasons as indicated above and in view of the
clear guidelines and directions contained in sub-paras (c) and (f) of
paragraph 207.9 of the judgment in Brij Mohanlal (supra), I am of the
considered view that there is no ambiguity in the directions of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court that the qualifying marks for persons working
as FTC Judges would be 40% in aggregate for general candidates and
35% for SC/ST/OBC candidates, both in the written examination and
interview combined. Therefore, I am in respectful agreement with the
views expressed by Hon’ble Justice B.K. Nayak.
              The reference is answered accordingly.
                                                     (S.C.PARIJA, J.)
