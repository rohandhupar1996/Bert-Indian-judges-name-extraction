appellants. Mr. B. R. Dey, learned senior counsel appearing for the
respondents had addressed this Court on the previous date on
                                                              Page 1 of 14

which the matter was heard in part, but there is no representation
on behalf of the respondents today before this Court when the
matter was called up for hearing.
2.     This   Second   Appeal      has   been   filed challenging    the
concurrent judgment and decree dated 13.07.2004 passed by the
learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Karimganj in Title Appeal
No.5/2003 dismissing the same, thereby affirming the judgment and
decree dated 30.09.2002 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior
Division) No.1, Karimganj in Title Suit No.46/1999.
3.     The plaintiff’s case in brief is that the land described in
Schedule-I to the plaint originally belonged to his father Late
Surendra Kumar Das. Surendra Kumar Das died leaving behind his
widow i.e. Lakshmi Rani Das, one son i.e. plaintiff and three
daughters including the defendant No.3 as his surviving legal heirs.
The father of the plaintiff, during his lifetime, had transferred the
Schedule-I property in favour of Lakshmi Rani Das. However, since
the plaintiff had become owner of 1/5th share in the Schedule-I land
left behind by his father, hence, he had filed Title Suit No.8/1996 in
the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Karimganj against his
mother Lakshmi Rani Das and sister i.e. the defendant No.3, inter
alia, seeking a declaration that the plaintiff is the owner of 1/5th
share in the property left behind by Late Surendra Kumar Das and
therefore, he had preferential right to purchase the share of the
                                                             Page 2 of 14

mother and the sister who were the defendants in the said Title Suit.
The Title Suit No.8/1996 was decreed ex parte on 12.05.1997.
However, the defendant No.3 had acted in violation of the ex parte
decree dated 12.05.1997 passed in Title Suit No.8/1996 and
executed a registered deed of sale bearing No.2301 dated
11.11.1998 transferring the Schedule-II land in favour of defendant
No.1. Since the plaintiff was entitled to a preferential right to
purchase the said plot of land from the defendant No.3 being one
of the legal heirs of Surendra Kumar Das and in view of the fact that
the registered deed of sale had been executed by the defendant
No.3 in violation of the judgment and decree dated 12.05.1997, the
plaintiff had filed Title Suit No.46/1999 in the Court of Civil Judge
(Junior Division) No.1, Karimganj against the present defendants,
inter- alia, praying for a decree declaring the registered deed of
sale dated 11.11.1998 as void and for other consequential reliefs
4.     On receipt of summons the defendant Nos.1 and 2 appeared
and contested the suit by filing joint written statement, inter alia,
questioning the maintainability of the suit in the present form for
want of cause of action and also on the ground of the suit being
barred under the principles of waiver, estoppels and acquiescence
as well as the law of limitation. The contesting defendants have
stated that the father of the plaintiff had transferred his entire
property in favour of the mother of the plaintiff i.e. Lakhsmi Rani Das
                                                             Page 3 of 14

vide registered deed of sale dated 12.05.1982 which fact was well
within the knowledge of the plaintiff. After having enjoyed the
property for more than 13 years the mother of the plaintiff had
executed a “baina nama” ( agreement for sale ) dated 16.12.1995
in favour of the contesting defendants agreeing to sell a plot of
land measuring 1 ½ kedar for a price of Rs.24,000/- out of which
Lakshmi Rani Das had also received a sum of Rs.18,000/- at the time
of execution of the “baina nama” pursuant whereto the possession
of the     said land had also been delivered to the defendants.
However, on account of failure on the part of the mother of the
plaintiff to execute a registered deed of sale in favour of the
defendant Nos.1 and 2, they had filed a suit bearing No.160/1996 in
the Court of Civil Judge (Junior Division) No.1, Karimganj for
execution of a sale deed in terms of the “baina nama” dated
16.12.1995. After the death of Lakshmi Rani Das the property left by
her including the suit land had been inherited by her son and
daughters including the defendant No.3 as a result of which the
said defendant No.3 had become owner of land measuring 1 ½
kedar being her share on the basis of an amicable partition
amongst the brothers and sisters. The defendant No.3 got the suit
land along with other land measuring 1 ½ kedar. Thereafter, the
defendant No.3 had executed the registered deed of sale dated
11.11.1998 in favour of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 in respect of the
Schedule-II land for valuable consideration. In the above manner,
                                                         Page 4 of 14

the defendant Nos.1 and 2 have been in possession of the suit land
and enjoying the same. It is also the case of the contesting
defendants that although the plaintiff does not have any
semblance of right, title and interest over the suit land purchased by
the defendant Nos.1 and 2 and notwithstanding the fact that
neither the defendant Nos.1 and 2 were parties to the Title Suit
No.8/1996 nor were they aware of the ex- parte decree, yet, only
to harass the defendants the plaintiff has instituted the instant suit.
The defendants have, therefore, prayed for dismissal of the suit.
5.     Based on the pleadings of the parties, the learned trial Court
had framed the following issues :-
       “1.    Whether there is any cause of action for the suit?
       2.     Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form and
              manner?
       3.     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree as prayed
              for?
       4.     To what relief or reliefs if any the plaintiff is entitled to?”
6.     The plaintiff had examined one witness and exhibited some
documents in support of his case whereas the defendant side had
examined as many as three witnesses and submitted documentary
evidence. After examination of the evidence available on record
and on hearing the learned counsels for the parties the learned trial
Court had decreed the suit filed by the plaintiff by holding that the
plaintiff was entitled preferential right of purchase of the suit land as
the heir of the original owner Surendra Kumar Das.
                                                                   Page 5 of 14

7.     Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated
30.09.2002 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division) No.1 in
Title Suit No.46/1999 the defendant Nos.1 and 2 as appellants had
preferred Title Appeal No.5/2003 before the Court of Civil Judge
(Senior Division), Karimganj. After hearing the learned counsels for
the parties and on re-appraisal of the evidence on record, the
learned Lower Appellate Court had passed the judgment and
decree dated 13.07.2004 in Title Appeal No.5/2003 dismissing the
appeal , thereby affirming the judgment and decree passed by the
trial Court.
8.     Being aggrieved by the concurrent judgment and decree
dated 13.07.2004 passed in Title Appeal No.5/2003, the defendant
Nos.1 and 2 as appellants had approached this Court by filing the
instant Second Appeal which was admitted to formal hearing by
framing the following substantial questions of law :-
       “1.    Whether the finding of the learned trial court below are
              sustainable in law as per Section 22 of the Hindu
              Succession Act, 1956 which is not at all applicable in
              the present suit.
       2.     Whether the learned courts below are right and correct
              in giving benefit to the respondents/plaintiff under
              Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act inasmuch as it
              does not apply in case of Agricultural land in question
              Exbt. A is being the Agricultural plot of land.”
                                                               Page 6 of 14

9.      Mr. M. H. Rajbarbhuiya, learned counsel for the appellants
submits that the only claim made by the plaintiff in the suit is based
on his alleged right under Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act on
the ground that the suit land forms part of his ancestral land and
therefore, the plaintiff, being a class-I legal heir of Surendra Kumar
Das ,was entitled to preferential right to acquire the property sold
by the defendant No. 3 in favour of the defendants Nos 1 and 2.
However, submits Mr. Rajbarbhuiya, from the testimony of PW 1 i.e.
wife of the plaintiff it is evident that the plaintiff has himself sold
away his portion of the ancestral property without making any offer
of sale to the other legal heirs and has moved out to village Moina
wherein he has been residing with his family. Since the plaintiff has
himself acted in violation of Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act,
1956 by denying the right that was available to the other legal heirs
of Surendra Kumar Das, hence, he cannot now turn back and
exercise such right only to defeat the interest of the defendant
Nos.1 and 2.
10.     Mr. Rajbarbhuiya further submits that the ex- parte decree
passed in Title Suit No.8/1996 was evidently obtained by the plaintiff
behind the back of the defendant No.3 as well as the other two
sisters who are the legal heirs of Surendra Kumar Das. That apart, the
defendant Nos.1 and 2 were also not made              party to the said
proceeding all though they were necessary parties. It is also not the
                                                             Page 7 of 14

case of the plaintiff that the contesting defendants/appellants had
purchased the suit land being aware of the judgment and decree
dated 12.05.1997 passed in Title Suit No.8/1996. He, therefore,
submits that the appellants/defendant Nos.1 and 2 are bona fide
purchasers of the suit land without notice and therefore, their rights
and interest are liable to be protected under the law. In such view
of the matter, the judgment and decree passed by the Lower
Appellate Court is vitiated by illegality and hence, is liable to be
declared so by this Court.
11.    Per contra, Mr. B. R. Dey, learned senior counsel appearing for
the respondent/plaintiff, submits that the plaintiff’s basic case rests
on his entitlement under the law i.e. under Section 22 of the Hindu
Succession Act, 1956. He submits that there can be no denial of the
fact    that  as   a   legal  heir   of Surendra    Kumar    Das,    the
plaintiff/respondent did have a preferential right to acquire the
property of the other co-sharers including the Schedule-II land. Mr.
Dey, however, admits that the respondent/plaintiff has alienated
his share of the ancestral property without making any offer to the
other legal heirs.
12.    Having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the
case, on the last occasion when the matter was heard in part, this
court had requested      Mr. Dey to obtain instructions from his clients
as to whether he has any surviving interest or claim in respect of the
                                                            Page 8 of 14

ancestral property after disposing of his share. Today, when the
matter was taken up for further hearing, there is no representation
on behalf of the respondents. Be that as it may, I have perused the
materials on record and have also considered the arguments made
by the learned counsels for the parties. A scrutiny of the record goes
to show that the case of the plaintiff is based on the claim of
preferential     right under Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act,
1956 to acquire the property belonging to the other heir viz.
defendant No. 3.        The respondent/plaintiff is also trying to draw
support from the ex- parte decree dated 12.05.1997 which had
restrained the mother and the defendant No.3 sister from alienating
any portion of the ancestral land without making an offer to the
plaintiff.
13.        It is the admitted position of fact that the entire land
belonging to Surendra Kumar Das had been transferred by him to
his wife Lakshmi Rani Das i.e. the mother of the plaintiff by virtue of a
registered deed of sale dated 12.05.1982. Therefore, with effect
from 12.05.1982 Surendra Kumar Das ceased to have any interest
in the Schedule-I land and as such after the death of Surendra
Kumar Das the plaintiff could not have acquired 1/5th share in the
property as claimed by him. Since the registered deed of sale
dated 12.05.1982 is not under challenge , hence, it would not be
necessary for this Court to go into the question of validity of the said
sale deed.
                                                              Page 9 of 14

14.     It also appears from the record that on 16.12.1995 the mother
of the plaintiff i.e. Lakshmi Rani Das had executed a “baina nama”
in favour of defendant Nos.1 and 2 for sale of the suit land for a
consideration of Rs.24,000/- pursuant whereto the possession of the
land had also been allegedly delivered to the contesting
defendants. On 16.12.1995 Lakshmi Rani Das was evidently the
owner of the entire Schedule-I land by virtue of the registered deed
of sale dated 12.05.1982 and the plaintiff did not have any right, title
or interest over the said plot of land during the lifetime of Lakshmi
Rani Das.
15.     Apparently, the plaintiff had obtained an ex- parte decree
dated 12.05.1997 against his mother and sister i.e. the defendant
No.3 enforcing his preferential right to purchase the shares of the
other co-sharers. However, it appears that the property had not
devolved upon the plaintiff after the death of his father as the entire
land had been transferred to his mother who was alive on the date
of filing the aforesaid suit. Consequently , there was no question of
making any declaration under section 22 of the Hindu Succession
Act,1956 in favour of the plaintiff during the life time of Lakshmi
Rani Das who had become            the sole owner of the land on the
strength of the registered deed of sale dated 12.05.1982.
16. Since it is the pleaded case of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 that
Lakshmi Rani Das had executed a “baina nama” dated 16.12.1995
                                                           Page 10 of 14

creating a right in favour of the defendant Nos.1 and 2 in respect
of the suit land and the possession was also delivered to them,
hence, the defendant Nos 1 and 2 were necessary parties in Title
Suit No 8 of 1996. However, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 were not
impleaded as party in Title Suit No.8/1996 nor was the “baina nama”
dated 16.12.1995 put to challenge.
17.   Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 reads as follows:-
      “22.   Preferential right to acquire property in certain cases.—
      (1)    Where, after the commencement of this Act, an
      interest in any immovable property of an intestate, or in any
      business carried on by him or her, whether solely or in
      conjunction with others, devolves upon two or more heirs
      specified in class I of the Schedule, and any one of such heirs
      proposes to transfer his or her interest in the property or
      business, the other heirs shall have a preferential right to
      acquire the interest proposed to be transferred.
      (2)    The consideration for which any interest in the property
      of the deceased may be transferred under this section shall,
      in the absence of any agreement between the parties, be
      determined by the court on application being made to it in
      this behalf, and if any person proposing to acquire the interest
      is not willing to acquire it for the consideration so determined,
      such person shall be liable to pay all costs of or incident to the
      application.
      (3)    If there are two or more heirs specified in class I of the
      Schedule proposing to acquire any interest under this section,
      that heir who offers the highest consideration for the transfer
      shall be preferred.”
                                                             Page 11 of 14

 From a bare reading of the aforesaid provision, it is apparent that
the co- sharers would have a preferential right to acquire the
interest of other legal heirs in the ancestral property in preference
over a stranger. The purpose and intent of the Section 22 of the
Hindu Succession Act appears to be        to preserve and protect the
preferential right of a class-I heir to acquire the interest in an un-
divided ancestral property. Such right of pre-emption would be
available to a class-I heir against the other class-I heir(s) who
proposes to transfer his or her share to a stranger.
18.    In the present case, the learned court below did not record
any finding as to when and in what manner the suit property had
devolved upon the legal heirs of Surendra Kumar Das. Even
assuming that the property had devolved upon the plaintiff after
the death of his father even then it is evident that the plaintiff had
himself alienated his share in the ancestral property situated at
Khalorpar and thereafter, moved on to village Moina. It has been
admitted by the PW-1 that the share of the respondent/plaintiff in
the ancestral property including the homestead land measuring
about 2 ½ kedars had been purchased by Hayur Uddin and Samar
Uddin who are outside the family. In a case where the plaintiff
himself has alienated his share in the ancestral property in violation
of the conditions of Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 he
                                                            Page 12 of 14

cannot be permitted to claim any benefit under Section 22 of the
Hindu Succession Act, 1956 against the other heirs.
19.     A sale deed executed in violation of a decree passed by a
competent court would ordinarily be void. However,          as can be
seen from the record, the plaintiff had not impleaded               the
defendant Nos.1 and 2 in Title Suit No.8/1996 where an ex- parte
decree had been obtained. Since the appellants/ defendant Nos.1
and 2 claimed to have been put in possession of the suit land prior
to the institution of Title Suit No. 8/1996 they were necessary parties
to the said suit as no effective decree could have been passed in
their absence. On the face of the pleaded stand taken by the
defendants in the written statement, the plaintiff ought to have
pleaded and established the fact that the possession of the suit
land had been taken over by the defendants subsequent to the
filing of Title Suit No.8/1996 or that the defendant Nos.1 and 2 had
purchased the suit land despite being aware of the ex-parte
decree dated 12.05.1997 in order to claim any benefit under the ex-
parte decree. However, no such attempt had apparently been
made by the plaintiff. The ex-parte decree, therefore, cannot be
said to have any binding effect upon the Appellants/ Defendants
Nos. 1 and 2.
20.     Taking note of all the aforementioned aspects of the matter,
there is no hesitation for this court to hold that in the facts and
                                                           Page 13 of 14

circumstances of the present case, the plaintiff cannot claim to be
entitled to preferential right of purchase in respect of the suit land
under Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The learned
Court below has also not recorded any finding as regards the right
of the plaintiff over the suit land but has merely gone on to decree
the suit on the basis of an erroneous observation made to the effect
that the defendants did not have any right to acquire the suit land
in view of the provision of section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act. As
such, the impugned judgment and decree is not sustainable in law
and the same is liable to be interfered by this court.
21.    In view of what has been discussed here-in before, the first
substantial questions of law framed by this Court stands answered in
favour    of   the    appellants    and   against   the  respondents.
Consequently, this Second Appeal must succeed and is hereby
allowed. The judgment and decree passed by the learned Lower
Appellate Court is hereby set aside. The suit of the plaintiff shall
stand dismissed. However, having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, there would be no order as to cost.
       The LCR be sent back.
