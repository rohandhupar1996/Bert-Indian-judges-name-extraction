                          CRLREV NO.240 OF 2016
                                     ORDER
08 25.01.2018            This criminal revision is directed against
              the order dated 26.02.2016 passed by the learned
              2nd Additional sessions Judge, Cuttack in Criminal
              Appeal No.122 of 2014 confirming the order dated
              12.08.2014 passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Sadar,
              Cuttack in Criminal Misc. Case No. 304 of 2013
              rejecting  an    application   filed    by   the   present
              petitioner as not maintainable under the Protection
              of  Women     from   Domestic      Violence    act,  2005
              (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’).
              2.         The petitioner no.1 is the mother and
              petitioner no.2 is the daughter. The opposite party
              no.3 is the husband of the petitioner no.1, opposite
              party nos.1, 2 and 4 are other in-laws.
              3.         The petitioner no.1 moved an application
              before the learned S.D.J.M., Sadar, Cuttack under
              Section 17 of the Act with a prayer to pass an order
              directing the present opposite parties to provide a
              room in her matrimonial house or allow her to
              construct another room in her own cost in the
              residential area of the shared household of the
              respondents.
              4.         The    admitted    position     is   that   the
              petitioner no.1 along with her daughter and her
              husband are staying in a room on the shared
              household wherein her other in-laws are also

              2
occupying different rooms. In her application she
prayed for an additional room with the submission
that in the meantime her daughter has attained
biological maturity for which another room is
necessary for her convenience and privacy. She
further alleged that it has become impracticable to
accommodate herself with her children and husband
in a single room provided to her in the shared
household. In the alternative she sought for a
permission to construct another room over any
portion of the joint family property which admittedly
stood recorded in the names of all the shareholders.
The learned S.D.J.M. observed in the order that the
purpose of the Act is not to provide convenience
or comfort to the aggrieved person but to save her
from destitution. Hence, the learned court observed
that the petitioners have tried to claim share over
the properties in the guise of an application under
the Act seeking comfort and convenience which was
neither permissible under the provisions of the Act
nor was the purpose for which the Act was enacted.
The learned court also observed that admittedly the
petitioner no.1 along with her children have been
provided with the accommodation in the shared
household for more than twenty years and there was
never any allegation of dispossession or non-
availability of   accommodation.     Accordingly, the

               3
learned S.D.J.M. rejected the petition holding it as
not maintainable under the provisions of the Act.
5.          The petitioners assail the said order
before the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge,
Cuttack in Criminal Appeal No.122 of 2014, which
court    by   impugned      order    dated   26.02.2016
dismissed the appeal holding it to be devoid of any
merit.    The   learned    appellate   court  has   also
discussed in detail the factual aspects of the case
and has also observed in the similar line that the
circumstances as pleaded and the relief as prayed
for by the petitioners do not come under the
provisions of the act so as to grant any relief.
Learned Sessions Judge has also observed that it
was the pleading of the opposite parties that the
petitioners are having separate house, which have
been rented out and the accommodation as available
in the shared household does not have space to
make a separate room available for convenience and
comfort of the aggrieved persons. Section 17 of the
Act provides that every woman in a domestic
relationship shall have the right to reside in the
shared household, whether or not she has any right,
title or beneficial interest in the same. The aggrieved
person shall not be evicted or excluded from such
possession without the due procedure of law.

               4
6.         In the instant case, it is the admitted
position that the petitioners are staying in a room in
the shared household since more than last twenty
years. The only grievance, the petitioner no.1 had
made, is the space that has been given for their
accommodation is not sufficient since her daughter,
petitioner no.2 has attained biological maturity and
some separate space is necessary for her privacy
and convenience.
7.         It was submitted by the learned counsel
for the petitioners that Section 17 of the Act gives a
right to the aggrieved person to reside in the shared
household     and   residence   would   mean     actual
residence with minimum comforts and convenience.
8.         Thus, it was submitted that the learned
courts below erred in law by holding that the prayer
of the petitioners does not come under the purview
of the Act. The Act nowhere defines “Residence”. It
only defines “Residence orders” in Section 2, which
means an order granted in terms of Sub-Section 1 of
Section 19 of the Act.
9.         Section 19 of the Act empowers the
Magistrate to pass a residence order in the following
terms:-
           “Residence orders-(1) While disposing of
         an   application under   sub-section(1)  of
         section 12, the Magistrate may, on being

                 5
          satisfied that domestic violence has taken
          place, pass a residence order-
      (a) Restraining       the     respondent    from
          dispossessing    or   in any   other manner
          disturbing the possession of the aggrieved
          person from the shared household, whether
          or not the respondent has a legal or
          equitable interest in the shared household;
      (b) directing the respondent to remove himself
          from the shared household;
      (c) restraining the respondent or any of his
          relatives form entering any portion of the
          shared household in which the aggrieved
          person resides;
      (d) restraining the respondent from alienating
          or disposing off the shared household or
          encumbering the same;
      (e) restraining the respondent from renouncing
          his rights in the shared household except
          with the leave of the Magistrate; or
      (f) directing the respondent to secure same
          level of alternate accommodation for the
          aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the
          shared household or to pay rent for the
          same, if the circumstances so require:”
10.          It is not the case of the present petitioners
that they have been deprived of the residence in the

               6
shared household. On the other hand, it is the
admitted case that they have been residing in the
said accommodation since more than last twenty
years. Now, they claim that for their convenience
and privacy they require another room or in the
alternative they may be permitted to construct a
room on the space available within the residential
area. The question of permission to construct a
room does not arise at all while considering an
application under the Act. So far as providing
another room for their convenience, it has been held
by both the learned courts below that to construe
the right of residence to the extent of comfort and
convenience, more so when the petitioners are
residing in the given accommodation for more than
last twenty years, would amount to stretch the
imagination beyond the permissible beyond the
breaking point. Both the courts have also observed
that the petitioners, if so advised, can seek redressal
of their grievance in appropriate forum for getting
desired share in the properties, if they so deserve.
11.        Considering the stated facts and admitted
circumstances, I do not find any illegality or
perversity in the orders passed by both the learned
courts below so as to be interfered with in exercise
of revisional power of this Court.

                  7
         Accordingly, the CRLREV is dismissed being
    devoid of any merit.
                                    ……………………
