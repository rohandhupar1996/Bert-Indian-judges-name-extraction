           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.R. Dash, J.                    This Reference by a Division Bench to the Larger Bench raises
           the question whether ‘Grama Rakshi’ is a Police Officer within the meaning of
           that expression in Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act.

                                         2
2.             After scrutinizing the evidence in the appeal, the Division Bench
found that the appellant had made extra judicial confession before P.W.1,
who is the ‘Grama Rakshi’. At that time P.Ws.3, 4 and 7 were present. The
Division Bench was faced with divergence of opinion expressed by this Court
on the question as to whether ‘Grama Rakshi’ is a Police Officer.
               This Court, in the case of Madan @ Undu Barik vs. State of
Orissa, 43 (1977) CLT 512; Dusasan Bhoi and others vs. State of Orissa,
1981 CRL. L.J. 1452; Boisakhu Kollar vs. State, 60 (1985) CLT 61 and
Pandru Khadia vs. State of Orissa, 1992 CRL. L.J. 762, had held that
‘Grama Rakshi’ is a Police Officer. Per contra, this Court, in the case of
Khageswar Khatua vs. State, 1993 CRL. L.J. 2374, following the dictum of
Hon’ble the Supreme Court in the case of Raj Kumar Karwal vs. Union of
India and others, A.I.R. 1991 S.C. 45, took the view that ‘Grama Rakshi’ is
not a Police Officer.
3.             Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of State of Punjab vs.
Barkat Ram, A.I.R. 1962 SC 276, had the occasion to deal with the question
whether Customs Officer under the Land Customs Act 1924 (Act XIX of 1924)
or under the Sea Customs Act 1878 (Act VIII of 1878) is a Police Officer
within the meaning of that expression in Section 25 of the Indian Evidence
Act. After liberal reference to provisions of the Police Act, 1861, aforesaid
Customs Acts and construction of Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act,
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that Customs Officer is not a Police Officer.
While arriving at the conclusion, Hon’ble Supreme Court had ruled “the words
‘Police Officers’ are not to be construed in a narrow way, but have to be
construed in a wide and popular sense.” The Division Bench of this Court
found that in Raj Kumar Karwal’s case (supra) Hon’ble Supreme Court had

                                        3
referred to the decision of that Court in the case of Barkat Ram, which is a
Larger Bench decision, but the same was not distinguished or discussed.
Since in Khageswar Khatua’s case (supra) the decision rendered by Hon’ble
Supreme Court in Raj Kumar Karwal’s case (supra) had been followed, the
Division Bench was not in agreement with the view expressed in Khageswar
Khatua’s case. Another point of disagreement by the Division Bench with the
view expressed in Khageswar Khatua’s case is that, in Khageswar
Khatua’s case this Court had relied on and followed Raj Kumar Karwal,
which was a case dealing with confession made by the accused in a case
under the N.D.P.S. Act before the officers of the Central Excise and Customs.
Hence the Reference to resolve the question, whether ‘Grama Rakshi’ is a
‘Police Officer’.
4.             Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of State of Punjab vs.
Barkat Ram, A.I.R. 1962 SC 276, in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 have held
thus :-
                    “(16). The words ‘police officer’ are therefore not
               to be construed in a narrow way, but have to be
               construed in a wide and popular sense, as was
               remarked in Queen v. Hurribole, ILR 1 Cal 207, where a
               Deputy Commissioner of police who was actually a
               police officer and was merely invested with certain
               Magisterial powers was rightly held to be a police officer
               within the meaning of that expression in S.25 of the
               Evidence Act.
                     (17) There has, however, arisen a divergence of
               opinion about officers on whom some powers analogous
               to those of police officers have been conferred being
               police officers for the purpose of S.25 of the Evidence
               Act. The view which favours their being held police
               officers, is based on their possessing powers which are
               usually possessed by the police and on the supposed

                          4
intention of the legislature at the time of the enactment
of S.25 of the Evidence Act to be that the expression
‘police officer’ should include every one who is engaged
in the work of detecting and preventing crime. The other
view is based on the plain meaning of the expression
and on the consideration that the mere fact that an
officer who, by no stretch of imagination is a police
officer, does not become one merely because certain
powers similar to the powers of a police officer are
conferred on him.
      (18) We now refer to certain aspects which lead us
to consider that the expression ‘police officer has not
such a wide meaning as to include persons on whom
certain police powers are conferred. The object of
enacting S.25 of the Evidence Act, whose provisions
formerly formed part of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
was to exclude from evidence confessions made to the
regular police which had a very bad reputation for the
methods it employed in investigation, especially in
forcibly extracting confessions with the object of
securing a conviction. The past conduct of the members
of the police organization justified the provision. It is
too much to suppose that the Legislature did intend
that all persons, who may have to investigate or
arrest persons or seize articles in pursuance of any
particular law of which at the time it had no
conception, should be considered to be so
unreliable that any confession made to them must
be excluded just as a confession made to a regular
police officer. If it could not contemplate the later
creation of offences or of agencies to take action in
respect to them under future legislation, it could not
have intended the expression ‘police officer’ to include
officers entrusted in future with the duty of detecting and
preventing smuggling and similar offences with the
object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of
Customs duties. If the Legislature had intended to use
the expression ‘police officer’ for such a wide purpose, it
would have used a more comprehensive expression. It
could have expressed its intention more clearly by

                                        5
               making any confession made to any officer whose
               duty is to detect and prevent the commission of
               offences inadmissible in evidence.”
                                                        (Emphasis supplied)
               On a thorough discussion of the subject, Hon’ble Supreme
Court, per majority in the said case (Barkat Ram’s case) held that a Customs
Officer under the Land Customs Act 1924 or under the Sea Customs Act
1878 is not a Police Officer within the meaning of that expression in Section
25 of the Indian Evidence Act.
               Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the aforesaid case of Barkat Ram,
has, therefore, made it clear that the words “Police Officer” to be found in
Section 25 of the Evidence Act are not to be construed in a narrow way but
have to be construed in a wide and popular sense. Those words are,
however, not to be construed in so wide a sense as to include persons on
whom only some of the powers exercised by the police are conferred.
5.             Aforesaid view in Barkat Ram’s case was relied on by Hon’ble
the Supreme Court in the case of Raja Ram Jaiswal vs. State of Bihar,
A.I.R. 1964 SC 828. In that case (Raja Ram Jaiswal’s) Hon’ble Supreme
Court was to consider whether a confession made by the appellant and
recorded by the Excise Inspector, who was investigating the case, is
admissible by reasons of the provisions of Section 25 of the Indian Evidence
Act.
               Paragraph 11 of the judgment reads thus :-
                      “It may well be that a statute confers powers and
               imposes duties on a public servant, some of which are
               analogous to those of a police officer. But by reason of

                         6
the nature of other duties which he is required to
perform he may be exercising various other powers
also. It is argued on behalf of the State that where such
is the case the mere conferral of some only of the
powers of a police officer on such a person would not
make him a police officer and, therefore, what must be
borne in mind is the sum total of the powers which he
enjoys by virtue of his office as also the dominant
purpose for which he is appointed. The contention thus
is that when an officer has to perform a wide range of
duties and exercise correspondingly a wide range of
powers, the mere fact that some of the powers which the
statute confers upon him are analogous to or even
identical with those of a police officer would not make
him a police officer and, therefore, if such an officer
records a confession it would not be hit by S.25 of the
Evidence Act. In our judgment what is pertinent to
bear in mind for the purpose of determining as to
who can be regarded a ‘police officer’ for the
purpose of this provision is not the totality of the
powers which an officer enjoys but the kind of
powers which the law enables him to exercise. The
test for determining whether such a person is a
“police officer” for the purpose of S.25 of the
Evidence Act would, in our judgment, be whether
the powers of a police officer which are conferred
on him or which are exercisable by him because he

                                       7
               is deemed to be an officer in charge of police station
               establish a direct of substantial relationship with the
               prohibition enacted by S.25, that is, the recording of
               a confession. In other words, the test would be
               whether the powers are such as would tend to
               facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession from a
               suspect or a delinquent. If they do, then it is
               unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for which
               he is appointed or the question as to what other powers
               he enjoys. These questions may perhaps be relevant
               for consideration where the powers of a police
               officer conferred upon him are of a very limited
               character and are not by themselves sufficient to
               facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession.”
                                                       (Emphasis supplied)
6.             Analysing different provisions of Sea Customs Act, the nature
and extent of powers enjoyed by the Customs Officer, and also taking note of
Section 78 (3) and 77 (2) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915 including
provisions contained in Section 156, Cr.P.C., Hon’ble Supreme Court in the
said case (Raja Ram Jaiswal’s) in paragraph-12 of the judgment held that,
“unlike the Customs Officer, on whom are conferred by the Sea Customs Act,
1878, powers of a limited character which are analogous to those conferred
upon police officers, the powers of investigation into offences which a police
officer enjoys are conferred upon Inspectors or Sub-Inspectors of Excise by
the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act. It is the possession of these powers which
enables police officers and those who are deemed to be police officers to

                                         8
exercise a kind of authority over the persons arrested which facilitate
obtaining from them statements which may be incriminating the persons
making them. The law allows the police officers to obtain such statements
with a view to facilitate the investigation of the offences. But it renders them
inadmissible in evidence for the obvious reason that a suspicion about
voluntariness would attach to them. It is the power of investigation which
establishes a direct relationship with the prohibition enacted in Section 25.
Therefore, where such a power is conferred upon an officer, the mere fact
that he possesses some other power under another law would not make him
any the less a police officer for the purposes of Section 25.
              In the result, Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a confession
made by a person accused of offence under the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act
and recorded by an Excise Inspector, who is empowered under Notification
No.470-F, dated 15.01.1919, to investigate any offence under the Act, is
inadmissible by reasons of the provisions of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
7.            Section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915
provided in terms that “for the purposes of Section 156 of the Cr.P.C. 1808
the area on which an Excise Officer empowered under Section 77(2) is
appointed shall be deemed to be a police station and such officer shall be
deemed to be the Officer-in-charge of such station.” These provisions having
come to be considered in Raja Ram Jaiswal’s case (supra), Hon’ble
Supreme Court, taking into consideration the nature and extent of powers of
Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors of Excise and the direct relationship of such
power with the prohibition enacted in Section 25 of the Evidence Act, held
that, an Excise Officer under Bihar and Orissa Excise Act is a ‘police officer’
within the meaning of that expression in Section 25 of the Evidence Act.

                                         9
8.              The question as to whether the statements made by an
accused person to the Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Excise is not
hit by Section 25 of the Evidence Act and is admissible in evidence came to
be considered by a Constitution Bench (Bench of five Hon’ble Judges) of the
Supreme Court in the case of Badaku Joti Svant vs. State of Mysore, A.I.R.
1966 S.C. 1746. Having taken into consideration the provisions contained in
Section 21 of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 and other provisions,
Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the judgment held that,
Section 21(2) confers on the Central Excise Officer the same powers as an
Officer-in-charge of a police station has when investigating a cognizable case.
But, this power is conferred for the purpose of Sub-section (1) of Section 21,
which gives power to a Central Excise Officer to whom any arrested person is
forwarded to enquire into the charge against him. It does not however appear
that a Central Excise Officer under the Central Excise and Salt Act 1944 has
power to submit a charge-sheet under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Thus, though under Section 21(2) of the said Act the officer has
power of an officer-in-charge of a police station, when investigating a
cognizable case, the power is for the purpose of enquiry under Section 21(1)
of the said Act and the power does not include power to submit a charge-
sheet under Section 173, Cr.P.C. Even if the broader view, viz. that a Central
Excise Officer is a “police officer” is accepted, mere conferment of powers of
investigation like an officer-in-charge of a police station, into criminal offences
under Section 9 of the Central Excise Act does not make the officer a police
officer.
                Hon’ble Supreme Court in Badaku Joti Svant distinguished
Raja Ram Jaiswal’s case and held that the facts of the case on hand (in

                                        10
Badaku Joti Svant’s case) were more in accord with the case of Barkat
Ram (supra). Accordingly, Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the Central
Excise Officer was not a police officer under Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
From the discussion in Badaku Joti Svant, the ratio of the decision appears
to be that even if an officer is invested under any special law with powers
analogous to those exercised by a police officer in charge of a police station
investigating a cognizable offence, he does not thereby become a police
officer under Section 25 of the Evidence Act, unless he has the power to
lodge a report under Section 173 of the Cr. P. Code.
9.               Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramesh Chandra
Meheta vs. State of West Bengal, A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 940 (Bench consisting of
five Hon’ble Judges), again had the occasion to deal with the question
whether a Customs Officer under the Customs Act, 1962 is a “police officer”.
After analyzing the provisions of the new Customs Act and the decided cases
on the point, Hon’ble Supreme Court held the Customs Officer not to be a
‘police officer’ on the ground that he has not been conferred with the power to
lodge a report before the Magistrate under Section 173, Cr.P.C. Same view
was expressed by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Illias vs. Collector
Customs, Madras, A.I.R. 1970 SC 1065 (Bench consisting of five Hon’ble
Judges). The view has been reiterated by Hon’ble the Supreme Court in later
decisions in the case of Harbansing vs. State of Maharashtra, A.I.R. 1972
SC. 1224 and Hazari Singh vs. Union of India, A.I.R. 1973 SC 62. It is
pertinent to mention here that in the case of Illias vs. Collector, Customs,
Madras (supra) this Court referred to a number of decisions of Hon’ble
Supreme Court and finally approved the test laid down in Badaku Joti Svant
and reiterated in Ramesh Chandra Mehta’s case.

                                           11
10.              Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. Durga
Prasad, A.I.R. 1974 SC 2136 held that an officer conducting enquiry under
Section 8(1) of the Railway Properties (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966
cannot be equated generally with the police officers, as is clear from the
object and purpose of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957, under which
their appointments are made. It was further held that enquiry under Section
8(1) of the Railway Properties (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 does not
amount to investigation under the meaning of Section 162 of the Cr.P.C.
Hence, statements made during enquiry under Section 8(1) of the Act are not
at par with the statements made during the course of investigation. Affirming
this view, Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Balkishan A. Devidayal vs.
State of Maharashtra, A.I.R. 1981 SC 379, in paragraphs 39, 54 and 58 of
the judgment has held that, a primary test for determining whether an officer
is a ‘police officer’ is, whether the officer concerned under the Special Act has
been invested with all the powers exercisable by an officer in-charge of a
police station under Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code, qua
investigation of offences under that Act, including the powers to institute
prosecution by submitting a report (charge-sheet) under Section 173 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. In order to bring him within the purview of a
“police officer” for the purpose of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, it is not
enough to show that he exercises some or even many of the powers of a
police officer conducting an investigation under the Code.               After a
comparative study of the relevant provisions of the Railway Properties
(Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 and the Code of Criminal Procedure,
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that an officer of the R.P.F. making an enquiry

                                         12
under Section 8(1) of the 1966 Act is not a ‘police officer’ within the meaning
of that expression in Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
11.            In the case of Raj Kumar Karwal vs. Union of India and
others, A.I.R. 1991 SC 45, the question that arose for decision was thus :-
                       “Are the officers of the Department of Revenue
               Intelligence (DRI) who have been invested with the
               powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station under
               Section 53 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
               Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter called ‘the NDPS
               Act’) “police officers” within the meaning of Section 25 of
               the Evidence Act ? If yes, is a confessional statement
               recorded by such officer in course of investigation of a
               person accused of an offence under the said Act
               admissible in evidence as against him ?”
12.            Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the aforesaid case, took into
consideration the cases of Barkat Ram, Raja Ram Jaiswal, Badaku Joti
Svant (supra) and other reported decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court
and came to hold in paragraphs 10 and 21 that Section 25 of the Evidence
Act which engrafts a wholesome protection must not be construed in a narrow
or technical sense but must be understood in broad and popular sense. But,
at the same time it cannot be construed in so wide a sense as to include
persons on whom only some of the powers exercised by the police are
conferred. The important attribute of police power is not only the power to
investigate into the commission of cognizable offence but also the power to
prosecute the offender by filing a report or, a charge-sheet under Section 173

                                       13
of the Code. Unless an officer is invested, under any special law, with the
powers of investigation under the Code, including the power to submit a
report under Section 173, Cr.P.C., he cannot be described to be a ‘police
officer’ under Section 25 of the Evidence Act. The officer, other than a police
officer, invested under Section 53 of the NDPS Act with powers of an officer-
in-charge of a police station is not entitled to exercise ‘all’ the powers under
Chapter XII of the Criminal Procedure Code including the power to submit a
report or charge-sheet under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code
that being so, such officer is not a ‘police officer’ within the meaning of
Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
13.             The same view has been reiterated by Hon’ble Supreme Court
in State of Gujarat vs. Anirudhsing and another, A.I.R. 1997 SC 2780,
wherein the Apex Court has held that a senior Reserve Police Officer
appointed under the State Reserve Police Force Act, is although a police
officer under the Bombay Police Act and an officer in-charge of the police
station for the purpose of maintaining law and order and tranquility in the
society, but he does not have the power of investigation under Chapter XII of
the Cr.P.C. and is, therefore, not a “police officer” within the meaning of
Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
14.             The decision rendered by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the
aforesaid case of Raj Kumar Karwal clearly shows that Hon’ble Supreme
Court has relied on the case of Barkat Ram (supra) and has also followed the
case of Badaku Joti Svant and other reported decisions of the Supreme
Court to come to the conclusion. Though Barkat Ram’s case emanates from
a larger Bench than the case of Raj Kumar Karwal, Hon’ble Supreme Court

                                       14
in Raj Kumar Karwal’s case having not been in disagreement with Barkat
Ram’s case, we do not find any justification to take the same view as the
Division Bench referring the matter being in disagreement with the view
expressed in Khageswar Khatua’s case (supra), which has followed the
case of Raj Kumar Karwal. We, therefore, are not one in our view with the
Division Bench referring the matter to the effect that the Supreme Court in Raj
Kumar Karwal’s case had omitted to consider the binding precedent of that
Court.
15.           From the discussions supra, it is clear that the test for
determining whether a person is a ‘police officer’ for the purpose of Section
25 of the Evidence Act would be that the officer though invested under any
special law with powers analogous to those exercised by a police officer in-
charge of a police station investigating a cognizable offence, he does not
thereby become a police officer under Section 25 of the Evidence Act, unless
he has power to lodge a report under Section 173, Cr.P.C.
16.           The Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of
State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Premlal, 1987 CRL.L.J. 204 has held that
‘Kotwar’ is not a ‘police officer’ within the meaning of Section 25 of the
Evidence Act, though he may be performing certain functions which are
performed by police and, therefore, an extra judicial confession made by an
accused to the ‘Kotwar’ is admissible in evidence and is not hit by Section 25
of the Evidence Act. In reaching such conclusion, the Full Bench of Madhya
Pradesh High Court relied on the case of Badaku Joti Svant (supra) and
other reported decisions of Hon’ble Supreme Court.

                                         15
                In the meantime, the Full Bench of Patna High Court (at
Ranchi) in Paro Chamar and another vs. State of Bihar, 2000 CRL.L.J.
4787 has overruled the Division Bench decision of that Court in Emperor vs.
MT. Jagia, A.I.R. 1938 Patna 308, by following the consistent view of Hon’ble
Supreme Court up to the case of Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) and it has been
held that “Village Choukidar” does not have power to investigate including
power to submit report under Section 173, Cr.P.C. Applying the said test, it
has further been held that he is not a ‘police officer’ within the meaning of
Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act.
                The Full Bench of Bombay High Court in Rajeshwar vs. State
of Maharashtra, 2009 CRL.L.J. 3816, following Raj Kumar Karwal (supra),
Badaku Joti Svant (supra) and other similar decisions of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court, has held that ‘Police Patil’ appointed under Maharashtra
Village Police Act (46 of 1967) is a person responsible primarily for village
surveillance, prevention of crime and providing assistance to police in
discharge of their duties. His duties and functions are subject to orders of the
District Magistrate. Powers of ‘Police Patil’ to investigate and control over
apprehended persons are limited in their nature and scope and are not as
wide, specific as of a ‘police officer’ under the Cr.P.C. A ‘Police Patil’ cannot
be said to be a ‘Police Officer’ in law for all intent and purpose. A confession
made to Police Patil therefore is not hit by provisions of Section 25 of the
Evidence Act, as the Police Patil appointed under the 1967 Act is not a ‘police
officer’ for purposes of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
                It is pertinent to mention here that ‘Kotwar’ in Madhya Pradesh,
‘Village Choukidar’ in Bihar and ‘Police Patil’ in Maharashtra are equivalent
posts of ‘Grama Rakshi’ in Odisha.

                                      16
17.            Oblivious of these developments, Mr. G.S. Pani, learned
counsel for the appellant relies on the case of Madan @ Undu Barik vs.
State of Orissa, 43 (1977) CLT 512; Dusasan Bhoi and others vs. State of
Orissa, 1981 CRL. L.J. 1452; Boisakhu Kollar vs. State, 60 (1985) CLT 61
and Pandru Khadia vs. State of Orissa, 1992 CRL. L.J. 762, to substantiate
his contention to the effect that Grama Rakshi being a ‘police officer’, any
confession made before him by an accused is hit by Section 25 of the
Evidence Act. He further submits that, this Court in Khageswar Khatua’s
case (1993 CRL.L.J. 2374) followed the test applied by Hon’ble Supreme
Court in Raj Kumar Karwal’s case, which had dealt with confession made by
the accused in a case under the N.D.P.S. Act before the officers of the
Central Excise and Customs. On that ground alone this Court in Khageswar
Khatua’s case should have distinguished the case of Raj Kumar Karwal.
               Mr. Debasis Panda, learned Addl. Govt. Advocate on the other
hand relies on different provisions of Orissa Grama Rakshi Act, 1967 and
Rules made thereunder, to submit that no where Grama Rakshi having been
empowered to file charge-sheet or submit a report under Section 173,
Cr.P.C., he cannot be regarded as a ‘police officer’ in view of the consistent
view of Hon’ble the Supreme Court and the dictum in Raj Kumar Karwal’s
case, which squarely applies to the facts of the present case as well as to the
facts in Khageswar Khatua’s case.
18.            As held in the case of Barkat Ram, the words “police officers”
should not be construed in a narrow way but have to be construed in a wide
and popular sense. No problem arises when confession is made by an
accused before a police officer of a regular police establishment within the
provisions of the Cr.P.C. Such a confession attracts the inhibition of Section

                                          17
25 of the Evidence Act. Problem however arises when certain police powers
are conferred on persons exercising certain authority and police powers
under a Special Act. Under this category come officers exercising police
powers under Customs Act, N.D.P.S. Act, Central Excise Act, etc. Faced with
such problem, Hon’ble Supreme Court in Barkat Ram’s case (Bench
consisting of three Hon’ble Judges) took a view to construe the words “police
officers” in a wide and popular sense, but the construction should not be so
wide as to include persons on whom certain police powers are conferred. In
Badaku Joti Svant’s case (Bench consisting of five Hon’ble Judges), Hon’ble
Supreme Court, for the first time, adopted the test as discussed supra to
determine as to who should be considered as a police officer within the
meaning of that expression in Section 25 of the Evidence Act. The test
adopted by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Badaku Joti Svant’s case has been
followed and applied by the Supreme Court subsequently in the case of Raj
Kumar Karwal and other reported decisions as discussed supra.
Irrespective of the Act/Acts, Hon’ble Supreme Court had dealt with in the
aforesaid cases, the test adopted by it for determining as to who is a police
officer has got universal application whenever any court is faced with the
question as to whether a person exercising certain police powers under a
special Act is a police officer within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence
Act.
               Section 21 of the Police Act 1861 speaks of officers, who are
not enrolled as police officers, and in such categories mentions hereditary or
other village police officers. Therefore, “Grama Rakshi” being admittedly a
village police officer is not a police officer within the meaning of the Police Act
1861. Grama Rakshi is also not a police officer within the provisions of the
Cr.P.C., as no provision of Cr.P.C. mentions about any village police officer or

                                        18
equivalent post or position. Appointment, duties and responsibilities of a
Grama Rakshi are governed by the Orissa Grama Rakshi Act, 1967, which is
a special Act. Said Act and the Rules made thereunder confer certain police
powers on the Grama Rakshis. The Grama Rakshis therefore enjoy certain
police powers on the areas for which they are appointed under a special Act.
The question before this Court is whether a Grama Rakshi conferred with
certain police powers under a Special Act is a ‘police officer’ within the
meaning of that expression in Section 25 of the Evidence Act. In view of our
discussion supra, to answer the question, the test adopted by Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the cases of Badaku Joti Svant, Raj Kumar Karwal and
other cases shall have application to the facts of the present case. On the
same analogy we also hold that this Court in the case of Khageswar Khatua
had rightly followed the ratio in the case of Raj Kumar Karwal.
19.             This Court, in the case of Madan @ Undu Barik, relied on the
case of Emperor vs. MT. Jagia, A.I.R. 1938 Patna 308 and the case of Birja
vs. Emperor, A.I.R. 1941 Oudh 563 to hold that Grama Rakshi is a ‘police
officer’ and any confession made before him by an accused is hit by Section
25 of the Evidence Act. This Court followed the ratio of Barkat Ram (supra)
in Madan @ Undu Barik’s case to the extent that the words “police officers”
are not to be construed in a narrow way, but have to be construed in a wide
and popular sense. Decision of the Division Bench in Madan @ Undu Barik
(supra) was followed in all subsequent cases relied by Mr. G.S. Pani, learned
counsel for the appellant.
                As discussed supra, Full Bench of Patna High Court in the
meantime has already overruled Emperor vs. MT. Jagia, A.I.R. 1938 Patna

                                       19
308 and, therefore, the very basis of the decision in Madan @ Undu Barik’s
case has been held to be an erroneous view.
20.            In view of law laid down consistently by the Apex Court, as
discussed supra to the effect that unless a person is entitled to make
investigation under Chapter XII, Cr.P.C. and submit the report under Section
173 thereof, he cannot be treated as a ‘police officer’ for the purpose of
Section 25 of the Evidence Act, the answer to the extent as to whether a
Grama Rakshi is a ‘police officer’ within the meaning of Section 25 of the
Evidence Act depends on answer to another question, viz. whether he has
the power of investigation including the power to submit report under Chapter
XII, Cr.P.C. as per the scheme of Orissa Grama Rakshi Act, 1967 or Rules
made thereunder. If he is found to have such power, he is a ‘police officer’,
otherwise not.
21.            Mr. G.S. Pani, learned counsel for the appellant relies heavily
on powers conferred on a Grama Rakshi to arrest any person in exercise of
his powers, as provided in Rule 17 of Orissa Grama Rakshi Rules 1969, to
contend that the power of arrest having been vested in a Grama Rakshi, he
has the necessary authority to extort confession from an accused person if
such occasion for him so arises. Mr. Pani further submits that though Grama
Rakshi is appointed by the District Magistrate, his duties and responsibilities,
as outlined in the Act and Rules, make him more proximate with the police
establishment and the police officer investigating the case in suitable cases,
may influence him to give a statement alleging extra judicial confession
before him by an accused.

                                        20
                 Mr. Debasis Panda, learned Addl. Govt. Advocate on the other
hand tries to dispel fear expressed by learned counsel for the appellant, by
submitting that possibility of an unscrupulous police officer influencing a
Grama Rakshi to give a statement under Section 161, Cr.P.C. alleging extra
judicial confession made by an accused before him can not be a ground to
declare him (Grama Rakshi) as a ‘police officer’, as on admission of his
statement into evidence it depends on the Court to appreciate the same like
any other evidence and proper appreciation of evidence in such a case is the
real safeguard to check such fear in the mind of the learned counsel for the
appellant. Mr. Panda, learned Addl. Govt. Advocate further submits that
power of arrest having been given to private persons in Section 43 of the
Cr.P.C., such conferment of power on a Grama Rakshi in Rule 17 of the
Orissa Grama Rakshi Rule 1969 cannot make the Grama Rakshi a ‘police
officer’ within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
22.              Section 3 of the Orissa Grama Rakshi Act speaks about
constitution of Grama Rakshi Force.          Section 4 thereof provides that
administration of the Grama Rakshi within a district is to vest in the Magistrate
of the district subject to the control and direction of the Revenue Divisional
Commissioner. Section 5 invests the Magistrate of the district with the power
to appoint the Grama Rakshis. Section 6, which prescribes the powers and
duties of the Grama Rakshi, reads as follows :-
                 “6. Powers and duties of Grama Rakshis –
                 Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
                 Criminal Procedure, 1898, (5 of 1898), every Grama

                       21
Rakshi shall exercise and discharge the following
powers and duties, namely :
      (a)   to give immediate information to the
            officer-in-charge of the police-station
            within whose local limits, the village, of
            which he is the Grama Rakshi, is situated,
            of every unnatural, suspicious or sudden
            death which may occur and of every
            offence specified in the Schedule which is
            committed in such village;
      (b)   to keep the police informed of all disputes,
            which are likely to lead to a riot or serious
            affray ;
      (c)   to the best of his ability, to prevent and
            interpose for the purpose of preventing
            the commission of any offence specified in
            the Schedule;
      (d)   to assist private persons in making such
            arrests as they may lawfully make and to
            report such arrests without delay to the
            officer-in-charge of the aforesaid police-
            station;
      (e)   to observe and from time to time to report
            the officer-in-charge of the aforesaid
            police-station the movements of all bad
            characters and also of the arrival of any

               22
    suspicious      characters       within    his
    jurisdiction;
(f) to report the births and deaths, which
    have occurred within his jurisdiction to the
    officer-in-charge of the aforesaid police-
    station at an interval of fifteen days;
(g) to supply any local information which the
    Magistrate of the district, Sub-divisional
    officer or any Police-officer may require;
(h) to assist the Grama Panchayat and the
    Revenue Officers within whose local limits
    he is appointed, in making collection of
    taxes levied by the Grama Panchayat and
    of dues payable to Government and to
    assist the Grama Panchayat in serving the
    notices issued by it and calling persons to
    attend at all meetings convened by it;
(i) to assist the Police-officers in investigation
    of offences and in identification of
    witnesses, persons summoned by a
    Court,     and   persons      against   whom
    warrants of arrest have been issued by a
    Court;
(j) to report immediately to the officer-in-
    charge of the aforesaid police-station any
    damage to any protected monument or
    public property;

                                       23
                      (k)    to regulate and control the traffic in the
                             streets, and to prevent obstructions
                             therein;
                      (l)    to take care of Government land,
                             orchards, trees and other Government
                             property entrusted to him; and
                      (m)    to exercise and perform such other
                             powers and duties as may be prescribed.”
                Rule 17 of the Rules invests the Grama Rakshi with power to
arrest any person and take such person forthwith to the police station. Rules
16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the Rules prescribe certain other duties for
the Grama Rakshis to perform.
23.             No where the Act or the Rules prescribe any power or authority
on the part of the Grama Rakshi to investigate a case or to submit a report
(charge-sheet) under Section 173, Cr.P.C. The powers to be exercised by
the Grama Rakshi, is primarily for surveillance, prevention of crime in the
village, providing assistance to police in discharge of their duties and provide
assistance to Panchayat and Revenue Authorities, whenever required. So far
as power of arrest by the Grama Rakshi or assistance by him to a private
person to arrest a culprit are concerned, similar power is given to even a
private person under Section 43 of the Cr.P.C., which provides that any
private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his
presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence or is a proclaimed
offender and make over any person so arrested to the police officer or to the
police station. For the aforesaid power of arrest on the part of a private

                                         24
person, a private person making an arrest in a given case cannot be treated
as a police officer within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
Such a view, if taken, becomes too far fetched. In view of such fact, similar
power given to a Grama Rakshi in Rule 17 of the Rules will not make him a
‘police officer’ within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, because
he has neither further power of investigation nor has authority of submitting
charge-sheet against the person arrested.
24.              The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Francis Stanly
alias Stalin vs. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control Bureau,
Thiruvananthapuram, A.I.R. 2007 SC 794, relied on the case of Raj Kumar
Karwal (supra), and proceeding further held thus :-
                 “15. We are of the opinion that while it is true that a
                 confession made before an Officer of the Department of
                 Revenue Intelligence under the NDPS Act may not be
                 hit by Section 25 in view of the aforesaid decisions, yet
                 such a confession must be subject to closer scrutiny
                 than a confession made to private citizens or officials
                 who do not have investigating powers under Act. Hence
                 the alleged confession made by the same appellant
                 must be subjected to closer scrutiny than would
                 otherwise be required.”
                 The aforesaid dictum of Hon’ble Supreme Court makes it clear
that more care and circumspection is expected from the Courts appreciating
the evidence so far as confession made by an accused before an officer

                                         25
investigating the case is concerned, when such confession is held to be
admissible under Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
25.            From the duties and responsibilities of a Grama Rakshi, as
discussed above, it is clear that he (a Grama Rakshi), for the nature of his
duties, has got proximate relationship with the regular police establishment.
Because of his position in the scheme of things and his vulnerability as a
rustic person coupled with the dominant supervision over him by the police,
there is possibility of his being influenced by an Investigating Officer to secure
a conviction in certain cases, though not all. It may so happen that in a case,
where there is no other evidence, the extra judicial confession of the accused
before a Grama Rakshi may be brought on record by examining the Grama
Rakshi under Section 161, Cr.P.C. The Grama Rakshi in such a case,
because of his inferior position, is bound to support his statement during trial.
The accused, otherwise in such a case, may take advantage of Section 24 of
the Evidence Act. We, however, taking a clue from the case of Francis
Stanly @ Stalin (supra), are constrained to hold that the Court in such a
situation, when confession before a Grama Rakshi is brought in evidence,
should insist, as a rule of prudence, on corroboration.
26.            The discussion supra, therefore, shows that the view expressed
by the Division Bench of this Court in Madan @ Undu Barik’s case is
erroneous and subsequent decisions of this Court on the said point like
Dusasan Bhoi and others vs. State of Orissa, 1981 CRL. L.J. 1452;
Boisakhu Kollar vs. State, 60 (1985) CLT 61 and Pandru Khadia vs. State
of Orissa, 1992 CRL. L.J. 762, etc. are also erroneous. They are held to be
not good law in view of the development of law, as discussed supra.

                                                 26
       27.                In view of the decisions of Hon’ble Supreme Court discussed
       supra and of this Court in Khageswar Khatua’s case (supra), the view taken
       in Madan @ Undu Barik’s case and other similar decisions in the case of
       Dusasan Bhoi and others vs. State of Orissa, 1981 CRL. L.J. 1452;
       Boisakhu Kollar vs. State, 60 (1985) CLT 61 and Pandru Khadia vs. State
       of Orissa, 1992 CRL. L.J. 762, are overruled to the extent they hold that the
       confession made to a Grama Rakshi is inadmissible in evidence under
       Section 25 of the Evidence Act.
       28.                Accordingly, we express our opinion to the effect that the
       confession made by an accused before a Grama Rakshi is admissible in
       evidence, as he is not a ‘police officer’ within the meaning of that expression
       in Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act.
                          The Reference is answered accordingly.
