        P R E S E N T:
                    THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE K.R. MOHAPATRA
             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  ORDER
K.R. Mohapatra, J.           This appeal has been filed assailing order dated
        18.01.2016 passed by the learned District Judge, Koraput-Jeypore in
        I.A. No. 1 of 2016 arising out of C.M.A. No.1 of 2016.
        2.              The appellant filed an application under Section 9 of the
        Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, ‘the Act’) (CMA No.1
        of 2016) praying for an interim protection by restraining the
        respondent from liquidating /enforcing the bank guarantee offered

                                    2
by the appellant through IDBI Bank, Vishakhapatnam, issued
through Karur Vysya Bank Ltd., Seetammadhara, Vishakhapatnam
and for other reliefs. Along with the petition under Section 9 of the
Act, the appellant also filed a petition under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2,
CPC praying inter alia to restrain the respondent from invoking the
bank guarantee till disposal of the CMA. Along with the petitioner
under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2, CPC, i.e., I.A. No.1 of 2016, the
appellant also filed a petitioner under Order 39 Rule-3 to pass an ad-
interim order of injunction by dispensing with issuance of notice to
the respondent showing urgency in the matter. That petition being
rejected, the appellant has come up with this appeal.
3.           By order dated 28.01.2016, this Court, while issuing
notice on admission in appeal, directed that there shall be no
invocation of bank guarantee of the appellant/petitioner till the next
date (in Misc. Case No.71 of 2016). The said order is continuing till
date. It would be apt to mention here that while issuing notice in the
matter, this Court has kept open the question of maintainability of
the appeal to be raised at the time of hearing. Thus, the
respondent/opposite party on its appearance raised the question of
maintainability of the appeal at the outset, which is taken up for
consideration.
4.           Heard Mr.S.S.Rao, learned counsel for the appellant and
Mr.Manoj Mishra, learned Senior Advocate assisted by Mr.Tanmay
Mishra, learned counsel for the respondent-Company.

                                   3
5.           Mr.Rao, learned counsel for the appellant placing
reliance upon paragraph-11 of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of A.Venkatasubbiah Naidu Vs. S.Chellappan
and others, reported in AIR 2000 SC 3032 contended that order
passed either refusing or granting an application under Rule-3 of
Order 39, CPC is appealable one. Mr.Rao further submits that there
are two provisions under the Act, namely, Section-9 and Section 17
of the Act, which enable either the Court or the Arbitrator to pass
interim orders or make an interim arrangement. Section 9 of the Act
empowers the Court to pass interim orders or make interim
arrangement in contemplation of an arbitral proceeding. Though the
provisions of Section 9 of the Act deals with entertaining an
application for interim measure it does not make any provision as to
how the interest of the aggrieved party is to be protected before the
petition under Section 9 of the Act is taken up on merit. Thus, the
application filed for injunction can only be entertained under the
provisions of Order 39 Rules 1 and 2, CPC and not otherwise. Thus,
the appeal against the said order is maintainable before this Court.
             Right of appeal is not inherent one. It is a creature of the
statute, and should be considered on interpretation of the relevant
provision. Thus, it is to be examined as to whether the appellant has a
statutory right to prefer an appeal against rejection of an application
under Order 39 Rule-3, CPC. On a plain reading of Section 104 as
well as Order 43 Rule-1, CPC, which provides an appeal against

                                   4
order does not include an order of rejection of an application under
Order 39 Rule-3, CPC.
              Law is no more res integra on this issue. This Court in a
decision in the case of Sri Rabindra Kumar Mohanty Vs. Smt.
Sujata Mohapatra (FAO No.86 of 2012 disposed of on 10.07.2015)
relying upon A.Venkatasubbiah Naidu (supra) as well as decisions
reported in 1989 (II) OLR 455 and AIR 1993 (Orissa) 78 held as
under:-
          “6. In view of the discussion made above and the law
          laid down (supra), I have no hesitation to hold that an
          appeal is maintainable as against an ex parte ad
          interim order of injunction as provided under Order
          XLIII Rule (1) (r) C.P.C., but not against the order
          refusing to exercise power under Order 39 Rule 3
          C.P.C…...”
Thus, it can be unhesitatingly held that no appeal lies against an
order rejecting an application under Order 39 Rule-3, CPC.
6.            Mr.Mishra, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent
submits that the impugned order is essentially an order under
Section 9 of the Act and is not an order under Order 39 Rules-1, 2 or
3, CPC. He drives attention of this Court to the relevant provisions of
Section 9 of the Act, which would be profitable to be reproduced here
under:-
              “9. Interim measures, etc., by Court.— (1) A party
          may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any
          time after the making of the arbitral award but before
          it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a
          Court:-
              (i)     xx           xx          xx

                                   5
             (ii)  for an interim measure of protection in
             respect of      any of the following matters,
             namely:-
                   (a) xx          xx           xx
                   (b) xx          xx           xx
                   (c) xx          xx           xx
                   (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a
                   receiver;
                   (e) such other interim measure of protection
                   as may appear to the Court to be just and
                   convenient,
                   and the Court shall have the same power for
                   making orders as it has for the purpose of,
                   and in relation to, any proceedings before it.
             (2)     xx            xx           xx
             (3)     xx            xx           xx”
Mr.Mishra, thus submits that in view of the scope of Section 9 of the
Act it can never be said that I.A. No.1 of 2016 was filed under Order
39 Rules- 1 and 2, CPC. Though it is nomenclatured as such, it can
only be treated as a petition under Section 9(1)(ii)(d) and (e) of the
Act. Thus, an appeal against the impugned order would only lie
under Section 37 of the Act and not otherwise. He also relied upon a
decision of this Court in the case of Presidency Exports and
Industries Ltd. Vs. E. Shipping Private Ltd. and others, reported
in 2010 (I) OLR 867. In the aforesaid decision, this Court taking into
consideration the provisions under Section-9 and Section 37 of the
Act, and also relying upon different case laws, came to a categorical
conclusion at paragraph-8, relevant portion of which is quoted
below:-
             “….. In the present case, the prayer of the petitioner
          in the Court below was to injunct the opposite parties
          from removing /re-shipping the cargo in question

                                      6
          stored at Paradip Port. In the impugned order an ad-
          interim order of status quo in respect of the said cargo
          was passed. The provisions quoted above do not
          envisage the appeal can lie only against the final order
          passed under Section 9 of the Act. Accordingly, it is
          held that the appeal is maintainable.”
7.           Section 9(1)(ii)(d) of the Act empowers the Court, namely,
the District Judge to make any interim arrangement including that of
injunction or appointment of receiver. The language employed in
Section 9 of the Act, more particularly the words “and the Court shall
have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of,
and in relation to, any proceedings before it” makes it clear that the
Court shall have the same power to make any order in any
proceedings under Section 9 of the Act. Thus, an order making or
rejecting an application for ad-interim injunction is essentially an
order under Section 9 of the Act only and not otherwise. Further, the
scope and ambit of the Act does not empower the District Judge to
entertain any application beyond the scope of this Act, be it an
application under Order 39 Rules-1 and 2 or 3, CPC. Even if such
an application is filed the same can only be considered to be an
application under the provisions of Section 9 of the Act.
8.           Learned counsel for the parties made arguments at
length on merits of the case relying upon different case laws of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court. This Court does not feel it prudent to delve
into the merit of the case at this stage which can be effectively gone
into at the time of hearing of the petition under Section 9 of the Act.

                                          7
    Thus, in view of the discussions made above, this Court holds that
    the appeal under Order 43 Rule-1(r), CPC is not maintainable and
    the same is accordingly dismissed.
                     Interim order dated 28.01.2016 passed in Misc. Case
    No.71 of 2016 stands vacated.
                     While parting with the order, this Court must record its
    note of appreciation for able assistance of Mr.Tanmay Mishra,
    learned counsel for the respondent for adjudication of the appeal.
                     Issue urgent certified copy of the order on proper
    application.
                                               ………………………….
