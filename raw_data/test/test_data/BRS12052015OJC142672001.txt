         PRESENT:
                   THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI
              Date of hearing: 22.04.2015 | Date of judgment: 12.05.2015
Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.      The petitioner, who is a Scheduled Tribe woman
         candidate has filed this application assailing the communication vide
         Annexure-6 dated 27.09.2001, made by the Head of the Department
         of Business Administration, Berhampur University for not admitting
         her into MBA Course for the academic Session 2001-2002 & returning
         her original documents along with Bank Drafts though she was

                                      2
selected and placed in Sl. No.1 on the merit list of the S.T. category
and Sl. No.57 out of 84 of merit list without assigning any reasons.
2.             The short fact of the case in hand is that the petitioner
passed B.Sc. with Second Class Honours with Distinction. Berhampur
University issued an advertisement inviting application from eligible
candidates for admission into MBA Course (MBA-CAT-2001) for the
session 2001-2002. In response to the same, the petitioner having
got requisite qualification applied for the said course and after due
scrutiny she was allotted Index No.439 by opposite party no.3 on
14.07.2001. The Department of MBA, Berhampur University issued
Admit Card vide letter No.316 dated 31.07.2001 with Admission Test
Roll No.390 to be held at the P.G. Department, Berhampur University
on 16.08.2001 at 10.30 A.M. Pursuant to which the petitioner
appeared in the said test and was selected for admission to MBA
course for the session 2001-2002 having stood first amongst S.T.
candidates. Accordingly, she was intimated vide letter No.379 dated
10.09.2001 to send a Draft of Rs.1286/- drawn on the S.B.I. towards
admission fees and sessional charges and documents mentioned in
Sl.No.1 to 11 and declaration etc. so as to reach opposite party no.3
on or before 25.09.2001. Accordingly, the petitioner sent all the
documents as per the list and a Bank draft of Rs.1,286/- issued by
S.B.I., Gunupur dated 20.09.2001 by Registered Post          which was
received by the authority within the time fixed. Opposite party no.3
again issued another Registered letter bearing No.402/MBA/BU/2001

                                    3
dated 22.09.2001 to the petitioner indicating that she has submitted
only one Bank Draft of Rs.1,286/- and she has to send two more Bank
Drafts amounting to Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600/- in favour of H.O.D.,
MBA to be drawn at S.B.I. Bhanja Bihar (Code 2107) so as to reach on
or before 25.09.2001 otherwise her candidature will be rejected which
she received on 24.09.2001 at Gunupur. After receipt of the said
letter, immediately she prepared two Bank Drafts amounting to
Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600/- each from S.B.I. Gunupur and sent the
same on the same day in favour of the H.O.D., MBA to be drawn at
S.B.I. Bhanja Bihar (Code No.2107) by Dolphin Courier Service from
Gunupur so as to reach opposite party no.3 by 25.09.2015. But, she
was intimated by opposite party no.3 that she has not been admitted
to the said course for the academic session 2001-2002 and the
original  documents   along  with  Bank    drafts were   returned  on
27.09.2001 vide Annexure-6. On receipt of the said letter immediately
the petitioner and her father met Vice Chancellor of Berhampur
University and brought it to his notice that though she stood first in
the merit list of S.T. category and fulfilled all the requirement as
intimated to her, opposite party no.3 returned her all original
documents by Registered post with A.D. On consideration of her
grievance, the Vice Chancellor assured her that he will look into the
matter and directed her to come afterwards. Though the petitioner
met Vice Chancellor and Head of the Department on 12.10.2001, she
was intimated that seats have been filled up and as such they had no

                                      4
power to extend the seats. Consequentially, she has been denied to
prosecute her study in MBA course during the session 2001-2002
even if she stood first in the merit list amongst the S.T. candidates.
Hence this application.
3.              Mr. C.A. Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioner fairly submits that the petitioner filed this writ petition
seeking for issuance of a writ of mandamus or certiorari or any other
writ to quash Annexure-6 dated 27.09.2001 and directing the opposite
parties to admit her in MBA Course for the session 2001-2002 as per
selection of the merit list, if necessary by extending a seat for her
and/or “any other order/direction as may be deemed fit and proper”.
He further submits that during pendency of this writ petition since the
academic session 2001-2002 for the aforesaid Course has already
been over and though the writ petition has effectually infructuous
which is being heard in the year 2015 after lapse of fifteen years in
the meantime, the petitioner claims that “any other order/direction”
be extended to her and essentially she claims that for latches of the
authority since the petitioner who is as a S.T. has lost his career by
being deprived of her higher study, she should be granted relief within
the meaning of “any other order/direction as deemed fit and proper”
by this Court. In order to substantiate his case, Mr. C.A. Rao, learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner has relied upon the case
of A Registered Society and other v. Union of India and others,
AIR 1999 SC 2979 claiming damages for the loss sustained by the

                                     5
petitioner due to arbitrary and oppressive action taken by the
authority.
4.              Mr. B.S. Mishra-2, learned counsel appearing for
opposite party nos.1 to 3 submits that Berhampur University imparts
education in two years course of MBA and admission to the said
course is made by taking into consideration the marks secured by the
candidates in the common admission test along with the career marks
(i.e. the percentage of marks secured by the candidates from H.S.C.
to Graduation). It is admitted that pursuant to applications invited
from the eligible candidates, the petitioner applied for admission to
MBA course and participated in the common examination test and
taking into consideration her career marks as well as marks secured
by her in the common admission test she was in 252nd position out of
521 candidates in the select list. However, she had secured first
position in the merit list of the candidates belonging to Scheduled
Tribe category. It is further admitted that the petitioner has been
intimated by opposite party no.3 on 10.09.2001 for submission of
necessary documents along with Bank drafts by 25.09.1991 for taking
admission to the MBA course. It is also admitted that though the
petitioner submitted Bank draft of Rs.1,286/- towards admission fee
in favour of the Administrative Officer of the University, she had not
submitted two other Bank drafts of Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600/- each in
Business Administration Department of the University though such
mention was made in the prospectus which shall be collected for

                                     6
development fees and Seminar charges of the University. Therefore,
she was intimated vide letter dated 22.09.2001 to deposit the said
two Bank drafts by 25.09.2001, failing which her candidature will be
rejected which the petitioner received on 24.09.2015 and immediately
she prepared two Bank drafts amounting to Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600/-
each and sent the same to the University authorities which the
University authorities received on 26.09.2001 which is one day after
the last date i.e. 25.09.2001. Therefore, the petitioner having not
satisfied the requirement within the time fixed and the classes had to
begin on 27.09.2001, the authorities admitted Sri Siba Prasad Sabar,
the next candidate belonging to the same category (S.T.). Since the
seats had already been filled up even if the Bank drafts of Rs.6,000/-
and Rs.1,600/- each reached one day late, the petitioner could not be
admitted consequently she was deprived of prosecuting her studies.
Therefore, no illegality and irregularity has been committed by the
opposite parties in admitting the second candidate in the list
belonging to S.T. category on 25.09.2001 and allowing him to
prosecute his study in MBA Course for the session 2001-2002. The
number of seats for MBA Course is 30 as approved by the A.I.C.T.E
and the University cannot admit students beyond the approved
strength.
5.              Considering the above facts pleaded by the parties and
after going through the records, it is seen that admittedly the
petitioner stood first amongst the ST candidates and therefore she has

                                     7
got legitimate expectation to prosecute her study in MBA Course for
the session 2001-2002 by getting herself admitted to the said course.
As per the intimation letter dated 10.09.2001 the petitioner complied
with all the conditions stipulated therein by providing original
documents and also required Bank draft amounting to Rs.1,286/-
drawn in favour of the Administrative Officer of the University and
supplied   the   documents     mentioned    therein.    The   University
communicated on 22.09.2001 by Registered Post with A.D. to send
two other bank drafts of Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600 which the petitioner
received on 24.09.2001. In compliance with the same, without
causing any delay she immediately on the very same day i.e. on
24.09.2001 prepared two Bank drafts from S.B.I., Gunupur and sent
the same through Courier with a belief that it will reach by 25.09.2001
which was the last date of submission of documents for admission to
the said course. But, unfortunately the same was received on
26.09.2001 after the cutoff date for which the petitioner could not get
admission to the said course whereas the second candidate, namely,
Siba Prasad Sabar was admitted to the said course on 25.09.2001 and
allowed to attend the classes with effect from 27.09.2001. When the
petitioner caused an inquiry about her admission, she was informed
that the seat has already been filled up. Therefore, she made a
representation to the authority and since no action was taken she
approached this Court. This Court by order dated 20.11.2001 issued
notice by Special Messenger directing to keep one seat vacant if there

                                     8
is still any vacancy in the M.B.A. course until further orders. On
receipt of the same on 24.11.2001 vide Annexure-E/2, opposite party
no.3 allowed the petitioner to attend the class till disposal of the writ
petition. But, on 01.12.2001 vide Annexure-F/3 she was denied by the
authority to attend the classes taking the plea that this Court had not
passed any specific order allowing her to attend the classes in the
Department. As it appears, there were 32 seats in the MBA Course of
the University for the session 2001-2002 vide Annexure-C/3 and only
30 candidates were admitted to the said course and two seats were
lying vacant, therefore, the petitioner could have been allowed to
prosecute her study. The petitioner was residing at Gunupur which is
far away from Berhampur University. In any case, if there was any
requirement of other Bank drafts, then the authority could have called
upon the petitioner to appear in person on the date fixed. Instead of
doing so, she was intimated to send the Bank drafts so as to reach by
25.09.2001. The petitioner responded well to the letter communicated
to her on 22.09.2001 and prepared two Bank drafts immediately on
receipt of the said letter on 24.09.2001 and tried her level best to
reach the said two Bank drafts well within the time by sending it
through Courier, but unfortunately the same was received one day
after the last date. Therefore, she was deprived of getting admission
to MBA Course even though she stood first in the merit list of ST
category. If the documents including the other two Bank drafts of the
petitioner did not reach on the date of admission, how the second

                                      9
candidate was admitted immediately i.e. on 25.09.2001 and the
authority allowed him to continue his classes from 27.09.2001 on the
very next date which creates suspicion reason being if the seat
admissible to the petitioner could not be filled up, then second
candidate had to be intimated by the University to get admission to
the said course. But, the opposite parties have neither stated the said
fact in the counter affidavit nor in the subsequent additional affidavit
filed in compliance with the order dated 10.02.2015 which is just
repetition of the counter affidavit filed by opposite party no.3.
Therefore, if any seat was lying vacant because of non-admission of
the first candidate how the second candidate could be admitted
without prior intimation and allowed to prosecute his study on
27.09.2001 on the very next date that casts doubt on the conduct of
the authorities. Admittedly, the petitioner deposited admission fees
drawn in favour of the Administrative Officer amounting Rs. 1,286/-.
If she would have been admitted on that basis it would not have
caused any prejudice to anybody. The further amount which the
petitioner   was called upon to deposit by way of two drafts of
Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600/- each drawn in favour of the Head of the
Department, MBA was only meant for development fees and Seminar
charges. The same could have been deposited after the admission was
over. Therefore, the action of opposite party no.3 creates suspicion in
the mind of this Court that in order to extend the benefit of getting
admission to Siba Prasad Sabar who was not eligible to get admission,

                                     10
according to his position in the merit list, the petitioner was debarred
to take admission. So, the petitioner was deprived of her legitimate
right to prosecute her higher study. This action of the authorities is
arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution
of India.
6.              The petitioner being an woman candidate belonging to
ST category having passed B.Sc. degree with Second Class Honours
with Distinction and qualified in the selection test has got legitimate
expectation to go for higher studies i.e. MBA for the session 2001-
2002, but by the arbitrary and unreasonable action of the authorities
she was deprived of prosecuting her higher study. Therefore, „loss‟
caused to her life by not allowing her to go for higher study for no
fault of her own cannot be compensated in any manner. The dream of
the petitioner was vanished due to such arbitrary and unreasonable
action of the authorities. Even though this Court directed vide order
dated 20.11.2001 that if there is still any vacancy in the MBA course,
one seat be kept vacant until further orders pursuant to which the
petitioner was allowed to prosecute her study and subsequently, vide
letter dated 01.12.2001 she was denied to attend the classes when
two seats were lying vacant that itself amounts denial of prosecuting
higher studies by the University.
7.              Mr. B.S. Mishra-2, learned counsel appearing for
opposite party no.3 submits that since the academic session 2001-
2002 has already been over long since, the writ petition has become

                                      11
infructuous and the petitioner is not entitled to get any relief. Mr. C.A.
Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that
due to arbitrary and unreasonable action of the University authorities,
the petitioner was deprived of prosecuting her higher study, therefore,
she may be granted any other relief by passing “any other
order/direction as may be deemed fit and proper”.
8.              Considering such contentions raised by the parties,
even if admission to MBA Course for the session 2001-2002 has been
over long since, but since due to arbitrary and unreasonable action of
the authorities, the legitimate expectation of the petitioner to
prosecute her study has been jeopardized, this Court thinks it proper
to consider if “any other order/direction as may be deemed fit and
proper” in the circumstances of the case in hand can be granted.
9.              The apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan v.
M/s. Hindustan Sugar Mills Ltd. & others, AIR 1988 SC
1621=(1988) 3 SCC 449 held that the High Court was exercising high
prerogative jurisdiction under Article 226 could have moulded the
relief in a just and fair manner as required by the demands of the
situation. In exercise of such power under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India even though no specific prayer has been made in
the writ petition taking into consideration the facts and circumstances
of the case, this Court is inclined to mould the relief and pass
order/direction as deemed fit and proper as prayed for by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioner in the present writ petition.

                                      12
10.                The petitioner having been selected and stood first
in the merit list amongst the ST category candidate she had every
legitimate expectation to prosecute her studies and as such she has
complied all the conditions stipulated in the letter communicated to
her but depriving her to prosecute her studies because of non-receipt
of two other drafts amounting Rs.6,000/- and Rs.1,600/- in time was
illegal.
11.                The doctrine of legitimate expectation was evolved
in England, but has been followed in English Speaking countries
including India by application of which the Court insists a duty to her
upon an administrative authority in cases where otherwise, the
affected individual had no right to be heard. While the common law
rule of natural justice applied only to (a) the exercise of statutory
power, and (b) to the prejudice of existing legal rights or interests,
the doctrine of legitimate expectation extends this protection of
natural justice to (a) the exercise of non-statutory administrative
power as well, (b) where the interest affected is only a privilege or
benefit and it is not existing but prospective. (See (1984) 2 All E.R.
935 (C.C.S.U. v. Min.). This doctrine of legitimate expectation can
be considered to be an off-shoot of the general doctrine that every
public authority must act fairly. In England, it has been held that the
plea of legitimate expectation provides a sufficient interest to a
person to enable him to have judicial review in a case where he
cannot point to the existence of a substantive right. (See (1983) 3 All

                                      13
E.R. 801 (Findlay v. Secy. Of State). Of course, a mere hope of a
person that he would obtain or enjoy the benefits would not suffice
the doctrine. In order to constitute a legitimate expectation, the same
must have a reasonable basis. In the case of T.C.I. v. K.C.F.I.,
(1993) 1 SCC 71, the Supreme Court held that mere reasonable or
legitimate expectation of a citizen, may not by itself be a distinct
enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it
may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of
due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the
principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of
law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due
consideration   in  a   fair decision-making    process.  Whether     the
expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the context
is a question of fact in each case. In the case of Union of India and
others v. Hindustan Development Corporation and others, AIR
1994 SC 988, the Supreme Court elaborately dealt with the doctrine
of legitimate expectation. The Supreme Court held that the concept of
legitimate expectation in administrative law has now undoubtedly
gained sufficient importance. “Legitimate expectation” is the latest
recruit to a long list of concepts fashioned by the Courts for the
review of administrative action and this creation takes its place
besides    such    principle  as    the   rules   of  natural    justice,
unreasonableness, the fiduciary duty of legal authorities and „in
future perhaps, the principles of proportionality”. While dealing with

                                      14
the doctrine, the Supreme Court also held that the legitimate
expectation may come in various forms and owe their existence to
different kind of circumstances and it is not possible to give an
exhaustive list in the context of vast and fact expansion of the
governmental activities. Thus observing, the Supreme Court also
concluded that after a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case
whether it amounts to denial of rights guaranteed or is arbitrary,
discriminatory, unfair or baised, gross abuse of power or violations of
principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well
known grounds attracting Article 14 of the Constitution, but a claim
based on a mere legitimate expectation without anything more
cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles. It can be one
of the grounds to consider but the Court must lift the veil and see
whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting
interference and it depends very much on the facts and the
recognized general principle of administrative law applicable to such
facts and the concept of legitimate expectation is “not the key which
unlocks the treasury of natural justice and it ought not to unlock the
gates which shuts the Court out of review on the merits.
12.             Taking into consideration the above facts, this Court in
Rajashree Samal v. State of Orissa and others, 2008 (II) OLR
976, in a similar circumstance where the petitioner in that case was
deprived of taking admission into the MDS course for the session
2008-2009 and a person below her rank was allowed to prosecute his

                                     15
studies, set aside the illegal admission. The judgment of the single
Judge was challenged in a writ appeal. The Division Bench of this
Court also rejected the said appeal against which order the State as
well as the person aggrieved approached the apex Court and the
same appeal was also dismissed by the apex Court and justice was
delivered to the person who had been selected by following due
procedure of selection.
13.             As the session 2001-2002 has already been over, now
the question of allowing the petitioner to prosecute her study
following the principle decided in Rajashree Samal as discussed
above at this point of time may not arise. But, the relief can be
granted at this stage is the most disturbing issue to be decided at this
point of time. Certainly, the candidate having been selected and stood
first in the merit list of S.T has got legitimate expectation with high
ambition to earn livelihood by prosecuting higher study create better
avenue by joining in service in future. By depriving of such lucrative
position,   she  is   deprived  of  getting  higher  studies  and   also
maintaining better life style and as such, „loss‟ caused to her for no
fault of her own but due to arbitrary and unreasonable action of the
authorities should be compensated.
14.                 Let me now come to the question of „loss‟ which has
been caused to the petitioner due to non-granting of the admission by
opposite party no.3. In Consumer Unity and Trust Society, Jaipur
v. Chairman and Managing Director, Bank of Borada, Calcutta

                                          16
and another, 1995 (2) SCC 150 it is held that „loss‟ is a generic term.
It signifies some detriment or deprivation or damage, injury too
means any damages or wrong. It means “invasion of any legally
protected interest of another”.
15.                The pain and suffering sustained by the petitioner
throughout her life and mental distress and agony caused due to the
act of the authority depriving the petitioner to prosecute her higher
studies cannot be compensated in any manner. The 6th Edition of
Black law Dictionary at page 389 defines „damage‟ to mean as follows:
                   “ A pecuniary compensation or indemnity, which may
                be recovered in the courts by any person who has
                suffered loss, detriment, or injury, whether to his
                person, property, or rights, through the unlawful act or
                omission or negligence of another. A sum of money
                awarded to a person injured by the tort of another.
                Money compensation sought or awarded as a remedy for
                a breach of contract or for tortuous acts. In other words,
                the word “damage” is simply a sum of money given as
                compensation for loss or harm of any kind. Further
                simplify the same “damage” means the harm or loss
                suffered or presumed to be suffered by a person as a
                result of some wrongful act and a sum of money given to
                compensate the damage is called „damages‟.
The apex Court considering the facts of the respective cases decided
and granted compensation to the person aggrieved for loss and wrong
done by the authority. In Registered Society mentioned (supra) the
apex Court held that the Court can award „damages‟ against the public
authorities to compensate loss or injury caused to the petitioner
provided the case involves violation of fundamental rights by the
authorities or their action is wholly arbitrary or oppressive in violation
of Article-14 or breach of statutory duty and is not a purely private
matter directed against the private individual.

16.                Applying the said principle to the present context, it
appears that due to arbitrary exercise of power by the authorities, the
petitioner has been deprived of prosecuting her higher study it
violates the fundamental right of the petitioner as enshrined in the
Constitution. Therefore, taking into consideration the status, mental
loss, agony and deprivation of a better future prospects and to caution
the opposite parties not to act such a manner in future, this Court
considers it appropriate to award damages of Rs.2,00,000/- which
shall be paid to the petitioner by the University which will be deducted
the same from the salary of erring officers at the helm of        affairs
responsible for causing such loss to the petitioner.
17.                With the above observation and direction, the writ
petition is allowed in part.
