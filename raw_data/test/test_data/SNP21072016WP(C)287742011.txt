      PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.N.PRASAD
                              DECIDED ON- 21.07.2016
S.N.Prasad, J.        The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, being the
      petitioner, has filed this writ petition seeking to quash the order dated
      29.07.2010 passed by the Employees Provident Fund Appellate
      Tribunal, New Delhi in ATA No.248(10) of 2006.
      2.             The short fact of the case of the petitioner is that the
      Orissa State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC), Sambalpur was
      covered under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous
      Provisions Act, 1952 (hereinafter to be referred to as the “Act, 1952”,

                                      2
in short) bearing Code No.OR/1374, but failed to remit the PF dues
within due dates granted under the statute and accordingly, notice was
issued upon the Corporation under Sections 14B and 7Q of the Act,
1952 for assessment for the periods from 3/1983 to 9/1991 and
3/1995 to 2/1997 along with details of the belated remittance of the
payments. In response to the said notice, the Divisional Manager of the
establishment appeared and admitted the delay reason being was not
intentional. Accordingly, the competent authority has passed order on
27.05.2004 levying damages of Rs.69,063.00 under Section 148 and
nil amount under Section 7Q of the Act, 1952. Assessment was done as
per Para 32A of the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, 1952
(hereinafter to be referred to as the “Scheme, 1952”). Opposite party-
Corporation challenged the same before the appellate Tribunal as per
Section 7I of the Act, 1952 and the said appeal has been registered as
ATA No. 249 (10) of 2006. The appellate authority remitted the matter
back to the petitioner with a direction to assess the dues @ 17%
inclusive of interest. The petitioner aggrieved with the order passed by
the appellate authority is before this Court in the present writ petition
inter alia challenging on the ground that the rate of damages, which is
to be levied under Section 14B of the Act, 1952 has been fixed as per
Para 32A of the Scheme, 1952 with effect from 1.9.1991 and as such,
since the rate of damages has been provided under the statute, the
Tribunal, who is only the fact finding authority, cannot go beyond the
statute. It has also been contented by the learned counsel for the

                                     3
petitioner that the authority is duty bound to assess the quantum of
damage in view of the specific provision as contained in Para 32A,
which has been implemented w.e.f. 1.9.1991.
3.               After  being   noticed,   opposite    party-Corporation
appeared and filed counter affidavit. Learned counsel representing the
opposite party-Corporation has submitted that the learned Tribunal has
not committed error in passing the order and taking into consideration
the situation, which the Corporation was facing at that time and taking
a lenient view, the learned Tribunal has reduced the assessment to
17%, which is not contrary to rule and does not suffer from illegality.
Learned counsel for the opposite party-Corporation has placed reliance
upon one letter issued on 29.5.1990 in which reference has been made
regulating levy of damages at the revised rates in respect of all defaults
arising on and after 1.6.1990, i.e. defaults arising in the payment of
dues for the month of May 1990 onwards subject to the condition as
specified in the preceding paragraphs. Placing reliance on the same, it
has been submitted the Tribunal has not committed any error and as
such, the writ petition is not worthy to be considered and accordingly,
is fit to be dismissed.
4.               Learned counsel representing the Corporation has
submitted that Para 32B provides that the authority can reduce or
waive the damages levied under Section 14B. Rebutting this
argument, learned counsel representing the petitioner has submitted

                                         4
that there is no question of application of the provisions of Para 32B
of the Scheme, 1952 since Para 32B is applicable with respect to the
second proviso to Section 14B of the Act, 1952.
5.              Heard learned counsel for the parties and after going
through the records available with the pleading, the sole question,
arises for consideration is as to
                Whether the learned Tribunal in exercise of the powers
                conferred under Section 7I of the Act, 1952, has got
                power to go beyond the statute ?
6.              In order to answer this question, it is necessary to
refer to the provision of Section 7I of the Act, 1952, which is as
under:
                “7 –I. Appeals to the Tribunal. – (1) Any person
                aggrieved by a notification issued by the Central
                Government, or an order passed by the Central
                Government, or any authority, under the proviso to sub-
                section 3, or sub-section4, of section I, or section3, or
                sub-section 1 of section 7A, or section 7B except an
                order rejecting an application for review referred to in
                sub-section 5 thereof, or section 7C, or section 14B may
                prefer an appeal to a Tribunal against such order.
                (2) Every appeal under sub-section 1 shall be filed in
                such form and manner, within such time and be
                accompanied by such fees, as may be prescribed.”
Section 7L of the Act, 1952, which is being referred, is as hereunder:
                7L. Orders of Tribunal. – (1) A Tribunal may, after
                giving the parties to the appeal, an opportunity of being
                heard, pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit,
                confirming, modifying or annulling the order appealed
                against or may refer the case back to the authority
                which passed such order with such directions as the
                tribunal may think fit, for a fresh adjudication or order,

                             5
   as the case may be, after taking additional evidence, if
   necessary.
   (2) A Tribunal may, at any time within five years from
   the date of its order, with a view to rectifying any
   mistake apparent from the record, amend any order
   passed by it under sub-section 1 and shall make such
   amendment in the order if the mistake is brought to its
   notice by the parties to the appeal: Provided that an
   amendment which has the effect of enhancing the
   amount due from, or otherwise increasing the liability
   of, the employer shall not be made under this sub-
   section, unless the Tribunal has given notice to him of
   its intention to do so and has allowed him a reasonable
   opportunity of being heard.
    (3) A Tribunal shall send a copy of every order passed
   under this section to the parties to the appeal.
   (4) Any order made by a Tribunal finally disposing of an
   appeal shall not be questioned in any court of law.”
7. Para 32A of the Scheme, 1952 is quoted as hereunder:
   “32A. Recovery of damages for default in payment of any
   contribution (1) Where an employer makes default in the
   payment of any contribution to the fund, or in the
   transfer of accumulations required to be transferred by
   him under sub-section (2) of section 15 or sub-section
   (5) of section 17 of the Act or in the payment of any
   charges payable under any other provisions of the Act or
   Scheme or under any of the conditions specified under
   section 17 of the Act, the Central Provident Fund
   Commissioner or such officer as may be authorised by
   the Central Government by notification in the Official
   Gazette, in this behalf, may recover from the employer
   by way of penalty, damages at the rates given below:—
          Period of default              Rate of damages
                                         (% of arrears   per
                                         annum)
   (a)    Less than two months                     17
   (b)    Two months and above but                 22
          less than four months
   (c)    Four months and above but                27
          less than six months
   (d)    Six months and above                     37
   (2) The damages shall be calculated to the nearest
   rupee, 50 paise or more to be counted as the nearest

                                       6
                higher rupee and fraction of a rupee less than 50 paise
                to be ignored.”
8.              On perusal of the provisions as contained in Section 7I,
it is evident that any person aggrieved by a notification issued by the
Central Government, or an order passed by the Central Government,
or any authority, under the proviso to sub-section 3, or sub-section 4,
of section I, or section 3, or sub-section 1 of section 7A, or section 7B
except an order rejecting an application for review referred to in sub-
section 5 thereof, or section 7C, or section 14B may prefer an appeal
to a Tribunal against such notification or order.
9.              Section 7L also provides that the Tribunal may, after
giving the parties to the appeal an opportunity of being heard, pass
such orders thereon as it thinks fit, confirming, modifying or annulling
the order appealed against or may refer the case back to the
authority which passed such order with such directions as the
Tribunal may think fit, for fresh adjudication or order, as the case
may be, after taking additional evidence, if necessary. Thus, it is
evident that the Tribunal has been vested with the power to confirm,
modify or annul the order appealed against or remit the matter for
fresh adjudication or order, as the case may be. In exercise of the
powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Act, 1952,
the Central Government has made the rule known as “Employees’
Provident Funds Appellate Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1997.

                                        7
10.             So far as the case in hand is concerned, the factual
position, which is not in dispute is that the Corporation which is
coming under the purview of the Act, 1952 has defaulted in
depositing the statutory contribution in the PF account and as such
proceeding under Section 14B and 7Q has been initiated and the
authorities after hearing the establishment passed order determining
the damages due from the establishment under the Act, 1952. The
Corporation being aggrieved with the decision of the authority dated
27.05.2004 has preferred an appeal before the EPF Tribunal taking
therein the ground that the Corporation had sustained huge loss and
as such, the delay in deposit of the contribution was not intentional
rather it is due to the situation beyond its control and taking into
consideration this aspect of the matter, the Tribunal has passed the
following order:
                “Hence, assessing the penalty and interests on the higher
                side does not appear to be proper one. The appeal is to
                be remanded. The authority is directed to assess the
                liability @ 17% inclusive of the interests. The appellant is
                directed to appear before the authority from the date of
                this order within one month, failing which, the matter
                may be decided as per law. File be consigned to the
                record room. Copy of the order be sent to the parties.
The petitioner being aggrieved with the order regarding direction to
assess the dues @ 17% inclusive of interest is before this Court on
the ground that the Tribunal has got no jurisdiction to sit over the
statutory provision.

                                      8
11.             On perusal of the provisions as contained in Section
14B, it is evident that the said statute has provided in a situation
when the employer makes default in payment of any contribution to
the Fund and the provision for fixing the quantum of damages as per
Para 32A, which has been implemented with effect from 1.9.1991
wherein specific rate of damages (percentage of arrears per annum)
has been provided.
12.             Argument has been advanced on behalf of the learned
counsel    representing   the   opposite   party-Corporation  that   the
authority has resorted to the provisions made in Para 32B and
according to him, the Tribunal by following the provisions as
contained in Para 32B has rightly passed the order.
13.             After a close scrutiny of the provisions as contained in
Para 32B, it is evident that the provisions contained therein provides
the power to the Central Board to reduce or waive the damages
levied under Section 14B of the Act, 1952 in relation to the
establishments specified in the second proviso to Section 14B subject
to certain terms and conditions. From a bare perusal of the second
proviso to Section 14B, it is evident that the said provision confers
power upon the Central Board to reduce or waive damages levied
under this Section in relation to an establishment, which is a sick
industrial company and in respect of which a scheme for rehabilitation
has been sanctioned by the Board for Industrial and Financial

                                        9
Reconstruction (BIFR) established under Section 4 of the Sick
Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, but this is not
the case of the opposite party-Corporation, which was ever been
declared as a sick industrial company by the BIFR and as such, there
is no question of application of the provisions of Para 32B of the
Scheme, 1952.
14.             There is no dispute about the fact that the Court of law
or the Tribunal or quasi judicial authority is expected to follow the
statute and they are duty bound to follow it. The Act, 1952 being a
Central Act has been promulgated to provide the benefit to the down
trodden people being a beneficial legislation. In order to implement
the provisions of the Scheme in a proper manner, power has been
conferred upon the competent authority under Section 5 to frame a
Scheme. In pursuance to the power conferred under Section 5 of the
Act, 1952, the Central Government promulgated a provision under
the Scheme, 1952 containing therein Para 32A, which provides the
procedure to assess the rate of damages percentage wise per annum.
Thus, the Scheme, 1952 has a statutory force and as such, the same
is to be followed in its letter and spirit.
15.             The opposite party-Corporation has challenged the
order passed by the competent authority under Section 14B of the
Act, 1952 stating therein that the rate of percentage of damages may
be reduced considering the precarious financial condition of the

                                      10
Corporation and accepting the said contention, the Tribunal by
exceeding its jurisdiction has modified the order passed by the
competent authority by giving a go bye to the statutory provision as
contained in Para 32A of the Scheme, 1952. Thus, there is no doubt
in my mind that the Tribunal has never been conferred with any
power to sit over the statutory provision on whatsoever ground may
be, otherwise, there will be no sanctity of the statutory provision.
Moreover, it is not the duty of the Court or Tribunal to sit over the
statutory provision, rather it is the duty of the Court of law to see as
to whether the order passed is in accordance with law and certainly if
the order is not in accordance with law, the Tribunal or Court of law
has got power to rectify the same in consonance with the statute or
direct the authorities to rectify the mistake, but in no circumstances,
the Court of law or Tribunal can sit over the statutory provision on the
basis of sympathy. To note here that in our democratic system,
Parliament and Legislature are supreme and once the rule making
body has framed a Rule, the Court is to see that the rule of law is to
be followed. But without considering this, the Tribunal has passed
order travelling beyond the statute as provided under Para 32A of the
Scheme, 1952. Further, on perusal of the powers conferred under
Section 7I, 7L or even under Rules,1997 no such power has been
conferred upon the Tribunal. The Tribunal is only to see the fact
whether there is any error in the fact finding or not and not by calling
upon the witnesses or evidence assuming the power of a Civil Court,

                                       11
but no where it has been reflected in the statute that the Tribunal can
go beyond the statute.
16.            There is no dispute about the fact that if the manner of
doing a particular act is prescribed in any statute, the act must be
done in that manner. Reference in this regard may be made to the
judgment rendered by the Apex Court rendered in State of
Jharkhanda v. Ambay Cements and another, 2005(I) SCC 368
wherein it has been held that it is the cardinal rule of interpretation
that where a statute provides that a particular thing should be done,
it should be done in the manner prescribed and not in any other way.
17.            In Babu Verghese and others v. Bar Council of
Kerala and others, (1993) 3 SCC 422 their Lordships of the Apex
Court has been pleased to hold as under:
               “31. It is the basic principle of law long settled that if
               the manner of doing a particular act is prescribed under
               any statute, the act must be done in that manner or not
               at all.”
18.            The aforesaid principle has since been approved by the
Apex Court in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of U.P., AIR 1954
SC 322 and in Deep Chand v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1961 SC
1527. These two cases have again been considered by the Apex Court
in the case of State of U.P. v. Singhara Singh, AIR 1964 SC 358.
This rule has since been applied to the exercise of jurisdiction by
courts and has also been recognized as a salutary principle of

                                       12
administrative law. In this respect, reference may also be made to
the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of Zuari
Cement Ltd. v. Regional Director, E.S.I. Corporation and
another, (2015) 7 SCC 690 and in paragraph 15, it has been held as
follows :
               “15. Where there is want of jurisdiction, the order passed
               by the Court/ tribunal is a nullity or non-est. What is
               relevant is whether the Court had the power to grant the
               relief asked for. ESI Court did not have the jurisdiction to
               consider the question of grant of exemption, order
               passed by the ESI Court granting exemption and
               consequently setting aside the demand notices is non-
               est. The High Court, in our view, rightly set aside the
               order of ESI Court and the impugned judgment does not
               suffer from any infirmity warranting interference.”
19.            In view of the aforesaid settled proposition of law, in
my considered view, the Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction in
passing the order impugned by remitting the matter back to the
authority to assess the rate of damage @ 17% per annum.
Accordingly, the impugned order being not sustainable, is quashed.
20.            The writ petition stands allowed. No costs.
                                                       ………………………..
