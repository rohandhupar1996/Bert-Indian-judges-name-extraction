         For the Appellant              :      Mr. B Banerjee, Senior Advocate,
                                               Mr. P.C.Dey, Advocate.
         For the Respondent No.2        :      Mr. A Thakur, Advocate.
         Date of hearing & Judgment :          28.08.2015.
                               JUDGMENT AND ORDER
                                          (ORAL)
         Heard Mr. B Banerjee, learned senior counsel for the appellant. Also heard Mr. A
Thakur, learned counsel for the respondent No.2.
2.       This appeal is preferred by the plaintiff against the judgment and decree dated
16.7.2009 passed by the learned District Judge, Jorhat in Title Appeal No.4 of 2009 upholding
the decree dated 21.01.2009 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Jorhat in Title Suit No. 59 of
2005 dismissing the suit filed by him for specific performance of contract of agreement for
sale dated 18.6.2005 and for a direction to the defendant No.1 to execute and register a sale
deed on receipt of balance consideration amount of Rs.1,25,000/- and also for cancellation of
sale deed dated 19.7.2005 executed by defendant No.1 in favour of the defendant No.2
(respondent No.2) herein.
3.       The case of the plaintiff is that defendant No.1, who was the owner in possession of
the properties described in the schedule to the plaint, entered into an agreement for sale
dated 18.6.2005 with the plaintiff for a total consideration of Rs.2 lakhs and he paid
Rs.75,000/- as advance. Time and again plaintiff approached the defendant No. 1 to execute
the sale deed by receiving the balance consideration amount and he was always ready and
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                Page 2 of 9

willing to pay the said amount. But in spite of executing the agreement of sale in favour of
the plaintiff, defendant No.1, who is respondent No.1 herein, sold the land covered under the
agreement for sale deed dated 18.6.2005 to the defendant No. 2 by a registered sale deed
dated 19.7.2005.
4.       The defendant No.1 did not enter appearance in the suit.
5.       A written statement was filed by defendant No.2 stating that there was an oral
agreement between him and the defendant No.1 on 31.3.2005 for sale and purchase of the
suit property and an application was filed before the Deputy Commissioner on 6.5.2005 for
permission of sale /purchase of the suit land and on 11.7.2005, permission was granted for
execution of the sale deed. It is pleaded that purported agreement for sale deed dated
18.6.2005 is a collusive and manufactured document.
6.       The learned trial court by judgment dated 29.5.2007 dismissed the suit holding
amongst other that agreement for sale was not proved. An appeal was preferred against the
aforesaid judgment and decree dated 29.5.2007 and the learned lower appellate court set
aside the said judgment by remanding the case to the learned trial court to frame an issue as
per provision of Explanation II of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (in short,
“T.P. Act’”). After remand, in the light of the judgment of the learned lower appellate court, an
additional issue was framed to the following effect:
         “Whether defendant No.2 had the knowledge or notice of the earlier contract between
         the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 ?”
7.       After remand, plaintiff and defendant No. 2 examined two witnesses each. The learned
trial court in Issue No. 5 on the basis of the evidence adduced on behalf of defendant No.2
came to the conclusion that defendant No.2 had no notice of the earlier contract between the
plaintiff and the defendant No.1. Accordingly, suit was again dismissed. The appeal preferred
also came to be dismissed affirming the findings of the learned trial court. In addition, doubt
was also cast about the authenticity of the agreement for sale.
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                    Page 3 of 9

8.       The second appeal was admitted to be heard by an order dated 23.11.2009 on the
following substantial question of law:
         “Whether the learned court declared defendant No. 2 a bona fide purchaser for value
         by misconstruing the provisions of Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act as well as
         evidence on record?”
9.       Mr. B Banerjee, learned senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that plaintiff
was a tenant of defendant No.1 and, therefore, it was incumbent on the part of the defendant
No. 2 to have made enquiries before purchasing the properties from defendant No.1.
According to him, learned court below misconstrued the evidence of defendant No.2 and came
to a perverse finding that defendant No.2 had no notice of the agreement dated 18.6.2005. In
support of his contention, Mr. Banerjee has placed reliance on decisions of the Apex Court in
the cases of R .K . M oham m ed Ubaidullah & ors. -vs- Hajee C. Abdul W ahab (dead) by
LR s , reported in AIR 2001 SC 1658 (1) and R am Niw as (dead) through LR s. -vs-
Sm t. Bano & ors ., reported in AIR 2000 SC 2921.
10.      Mr. A Thakur, learned counsel for the defendant No.2 has submitted that assuming
that there was an agreement for sale dated 18.6.2005, plaintiff only had an equitable right.
However, by virtue of the execution of sale dated 19.7.2005, defendant No.2 had acquired
legal right in respect of the property in question. He has submitted that a reading of the
evidence of DW- 1 and DW-2 would unmistakably point to the fact that defendant No.1 had
accompanied defendant No.2 to the shop of the plaintiff with a request to the plaintiff to
attorn to the defendant No. 2 to whom the property was being sold. Defendant No.2 had
specifically deposed that plaintiff did not indicate the existence of any agreement for sale and
the evidence of the defendants had not been impeached in any manner and therefore, there is
no reason for this court to interfere with the finding of fact recorded by the courts below. By
drawing attention to Ext.-3, learned counsel submits that it is not understood why even before
the purported agreement of sale dated 18.6.2005, the defendant No.1 would have any
occasion to entrust the plaintiff to obtain sale permission for the purpose of sale/purchase in
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                   Page 4 of 9

his favour. The plaintiff did not exhibit any document to show his readiness and willingness in
real terms by producing the application for grant of permission/sale. It is submitted by him
that because of failure of the plaintiff to produce the copy of the application, the learned
Lower Appellate Court had occasion to doubt the authenticity of agreement of the sale. He has
submitted that when such application for grant of sale was already filed by any other person,
even otherwise, subsequent applicant would not have been granted permission by the
authorities concerned. He has contended by placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble
Apex Court in the case of Sahadeva Gram ani (dead) by LR s -vs- Perum al Gram ani &
ors ., reported in (2005) 11 SCC 454 , that under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963,
the jurisdiction of the court to decree specific performance of the contract is discretionary and
court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so. The learned
counsel also submits that the Ext.-1 agreement for sale deed dated 18.6.2005 was an
unregistered document and the plaintiff on his part had not placed any material on record to
show that the defendant No. 2 was aware of the earlier agreement entered into in between
him and the vendor.
11.      I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the materials on record.
12.      Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act reads as follows:-
               “19.   Relief against parties and person claim ing under them by
         subsequent title.- Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, specific
         performance of a contract may be enforced against-
               (a) ………………………
               (b) any other person claiming under him by a title arising subsequently to the
         contract, except a transferee for value who has paid his money in good faith and
         without notice of the original contract;
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                     Page 5 of 9

13.      It will also be relevant to take note of the expression “ a person is said to have notice”
as appearing in Section 3 of T.P. Act and Explanation II of Section 3 of T.P. Act, which read as
follows:-
         “3. Interpretation clause.- In this Act, unless there is something repugnant in the
subject or context,-
         “A person is said to have notice” of a fact when he actually knows that fact, or when,
but for wilful abstention from an enquiry or search which he ought to have made, or gross
negligence, he would have known it.
         …………………….
 Explanation II. - Any person acquiring any immovable property or any share or interest in any
such property shall be deemed to have notice of the title, if any, of any person who is for the
time being in actual possession thereof.”
14.      Section 19 (b) of Specific Relief Act provides that specific performance of a contract
may be enforced, other than the parties thereto, against any person claiming under him by a
title arising subsequently to the contract. However, a transferee for value, who has paid his
money in good faith and without notice of the original contract, is excluded from the purview
of the said clause. As per Explanation II to Section 3 of T.P. Act, any person acquiring any
immovable property or any share or interest in any such property shall be deemed to have
notice of the title, if any, of any person who is for the time being in actual possession thereof.
15.      Notice, as interpreted in Section 3 of T.P. Act may be either actual, where the party
has actual knowledge of the fact, or constructive. The word “notice” is of wider import in the
sense that a person may not have actual knowledge of the fact but a person is said to have
constructive notice of a fact when, but for wilful abstention from an inquiry or search which he
ought to have made, or gross negligence, he would have known it.
16.      In R am Niw as (supra), the Apex Court held that subsequent purchaser must make
enquiry into the real nature of possession of the tenant. In R .K M oham m ad Abadullah
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                      Page 6 of 9

(supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court had laid down that if a person is for the time being in
actual possession, it is imperative for the subsequent purchaser to make an enquiry as to title
or interest of the person in actual possession as on the date when the sale transaction was
made in his favour.
17.       Actual possession is notice of the title, if any, of the person who is for the time being
in actual possession thereof. A person may enter the property in one capacity and having a
particular kind of interest. But subsequently, while continuing in possession of the property,
his capacity or interest may change. A person entering the property as tenant, later on, may
become an usufructuary mortgagee or may have entered into an agreement for purchase of
the same property or may have some other interest created in his favour. Therefore, with
reference to subsequent purchaser it is essential that he should make an enquiry as to title or
interest of the person in actual possession as on the date when sale transaction was made in
his favour. A subsequent purchaser has to make enquiry as to further interest, nature of
possession and title under which the person was continuing in possession on the date of
purchase of the property. If the subsequent purchaser, without making an enquiry, relies upon
the assertion of the vendor and abstains from making any enquiry into the real nature of
possession of the tenant, he cannot escape from the consequences of the deemed notice
under Explanation II of Section 3 of T.P. Act.
18.      Though in the evidence, the plaintiff, who was examined as PW1, had stated that the
suit land and its premises was earlier occupied by his father as a tenant to run a business and
after the death of his father he continued as a tenant, no such averments were made in the
plaint. In cross-examination, he made it explicitly clear that in the land in question he had no
possession and he was in occupation of a room only. Neither in the plaint nor in the evidence
there is any indication that prior to the agreement dated 18.06.2005, the plaintiff and
defendant No.1 had arrived at an understanding with regard to sale of the property in
question. In the aforesaid context, it is difficult to comprehend execution of Ext.-3 whereby
the defendant No. 1 had appointed and authorized the plaintiff, amongst others, to bear all
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                       Page 7 of 9

expenses for taking necessary permission for sale. Plaintiff further stated that he paid Rs.
75,000/- in cash and though he pays income tax, he did not show this amount in Income Tax
return. It was also stated by him that he had not taken any receipt from the defendant No. 1
for payment of Rs. 75,000/- either.
19.      The plaintiff in para-4 of the plaint had stated that a joint application for land sale
permission was made by plaintiff and defendant No.1. No such joint sale application has been
exhibited by plaintiff. Though the plaintiff had stated that he had sent a registered notice to
the defendant No. 1 demanding execution of sale deed, he had also not produced the copy of
the registered notice or the postal receipt thereof.
20.      The agreement for sale, Ext. 2, is an unregistered document and its authenticity was
doubted by the learned Lower Appellate Court. Payment of Rs. 75,000/-, in cash, towards
part-payment and, that too, without any receipt is difficult to accept.        The plaintiff is a
businessman and he also says that he had not shown the payment in Income Tax return.
Thus, there is no proof of payment of Rs. 75,000/-.         The plaintiff has not produced any
documentary evidence to support Ext.-2.
21.      In the written statement, the defendant No. 2 had stated that the plaintiff had full
knowledge and notice of the agreement by and between him and defendant No. 2. In his
evidence as DW-1, defendant No.2 had stated that the defendant No.1, in his presence as well
as in presence of one Ram Avatar Lahoti, who was also examined as DW-2, informed the
plaintiff about the proposal of sale in favour of defendant no. 2 and had asked him to attorn
to the defendant No. 2 but at that point of time plaintiff never mentioned about his agreement
for sale pertaining to the suit property and therefore, he had no notice about the alleged
transaction. The learned courts below held that evidence of defendant No. 2 as well as Ram
Avatar Lahoti was not impeached in any manner and accordingly, the learned courts below
had come to the conclusion that defendant No. 2 was a bona fide purchaser without notice of
the earlier contract between the plaintiff and the defendant no.1.
RSA No. 163 of 2009                                                                   Page 8 of 9

22.      In the instant case, the plaintiff had not pleaded in the plaint that he was a tenant, but
took such a plea in the evidence. Be that as it may, the evidence of the defendants had
established that the plaintiff was asked to attorn to the defendant No. 2 as the property was
going to be sold. The fact that the plaintiff did not produce the agreement for sale at that
time, which would have been the most reasonable course of conduct in the fact situation, is a
circumstance against the plaintiff. It is also worth noting that while in the agreement for sale
the consideration amount is shown as Rs.2 lakhs, defendant No. 2 had paid, on the basis of
the land valuation fixed by the Government, consideration amount of Rs.11 lakhs.
23.      In view of above discussions, I am of the considered opinion that no interference is
called for with the judgment of the learned courts below. Substantial question of law is
answered against the appellant.
24.      Appeal is dismissed. No Cost.
25.      Registry will send back the LCR.
                                                                       JUDGE
