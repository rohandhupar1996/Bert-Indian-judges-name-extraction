05.12.2001 at about 7 p.m. the deceased who was his only son
and aged about five years was playing with other children on the
village street in front of Mangala Temple situated close to his
house. There was power cut in the village and thereafter the
deceased was found missing. In spite of frantic search, the
deceased could not be located and accordingly, at about 11 O’
clock on 06.12.2001 a missing report was presented by Pratap
Chandra Sahani (P.W.6). It is the further prosecution case that
on 06.12.2001 at about 4.30 p.m. while some girls of the village
had been to attend call of nature to the river bed, they found the
dead body of Sonu near Kalam bushes and accordingly, they
informed the matter in the village and the villagers rushed to the
spot and found the dead body with injuries on the right ear,
forehead and back head of the deceased. A brick was also found
at that place with stains of blood. The deceased was wearing a
locket in a black string which was found missing. It was
suspected that either for commission of theft of the gold locket
or   for some    other  reason,  some     unknown    culprits   have
committed murder of the deceased and threw his dead body
near the Kalam bushes.
            On   the   basis of  such   first information     report,

prayer for sending the seized articles to State F.S.L., Rasulgarh
and accordingly, the learned J.M.F.C., Pattamundai sent the
articles  for  chemical   analysis  and  obtained   the  chemical
examination report. A prayer was made by the Investigating

6.          The learned trial Court after assessing the evidence
on record has been pleased to hold that there is no direct
evidence in the case and the case is based on circumstantial
evidence and he has formulated the circumstances as follows:-
            (i)   Extrajudicial    confession     of    appellant
            Nityananda Sutar before P.W.7 and P.W.9;

                                  13
             (ii)  Judicial confession of appellant Nityananda
             Sutar before J.M.F.C., Pattamundai;
             (iii) Appellants   and   the  deceased   were   found
             together at the Mandap and appellants were absent
             soon after the departure of the deceased;
             (iv)  Appellant Nityananda Sutar led the police party
             and gave recovery of gunny bag and a black string
             with a locket;
             (v)   Appellant Rahas Behari Moharana led the police
             party and gave recovery of Bhanarfala;
             (vi)  Appellants had a motive for the commission of
             crime.
             The learned trial Court further held that Ext.5 is the
post mortem report which clearly establishes that the death of
Sonu was homicidal. It is further held that the evidence of P.W.7
and P.W.9 regarding extra-judicial confession supports the
judicial confession which has been recorded by the Magistrate as
per Ext.11. It is further held that appellant Nityananda Sutar
made extra-judicial confession and not only he implicated
himself but also implicated the other appellants and he has
vividly described the part played by each of the culprits and the
confession of the appellant Nityananda Sutar appears to be

                                 14
voluntary and true and can be the basis to convict the
appellants. It was further held that the extra-judicial confession
and judicial confession received ample corroboration from the
circumstances of the case and the confessional statement
revealed that the dead body was thrown at Kalam bush and all
the P.Ws. deposed that on the next day of occurrence, the dead
body was recovered from Kalam bush and this circumstance
shows the genuineness of the confession. The learned trial Court
further held that P.W.1 to P.W.6 stood the test of cross-
examination and their evidence shows that the accused persons
were present at the Pendal where Sonu was playing and they
were also found absent soon after the missing of Sonu and
thereafter nobody had seen Sonu alive and this fact shows that
the accused persons and the deceased were last seen together
and the dead body was found on the next day. The learned trial
Court further held that the recovery of the articles from the
places also corroborate the judicial and extra-judicial confession.
The learned trial Court further held that the evidence of P.W.2
and P.W.3 and Ext.11 taken together shows that the appellant
Gobardhan had a motive and that the progress report of son of
appellant Gobardhan which has been marked as Ext.A series
shows the degradation of his mental condition. It is further held

                                  15
that the circumstances brought out coupled with the extra-
judicial  confession   and    judicial   confession  of   appellant
Nityananda proves beyond doubt that appellants Gobardhan and
Rahas committed murder of the deceased and the appellants
Nityananda and Kartik conspired to commit the crime.
7.          Mr. Devashis Panda, learned counsel appearing for all
the appellants emphatically contended that the extra-judicial
confession alleged to have been made before P.W.7, P.W.9 and
others about one and half months after the occurrence in a
public place cannot be accepted as no reason was ascribed by
the prosecution as to why the appellant Nityananda Sutar would
repose confidence on those witnesses to make such a confession.
It is further argued that the contents of the extra-judicial
confession as well as the judicial confession shows that it is more
or less self-exculpatory in nature and it appears as if the
appellant Nityananda Sutar was standing at the place of crime as
a silent observer to the alleged crime committed by the other
appellants   and  therefore,   such    confessions  have   got   no
evidentiary value in the eye of law. Learned counsel further
contended that the reason for making the confession which has
been put forth by the prosecution on the ground of repentance of
appellant Nityananda Sutar for which he attempted to commit

                                16
suicide and was hospitalized in two hospitals has not been
substantiated by proving any medical documents. It is further
contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that there
are contradictions in the two confessions and the post mortem
finding runs contrary to the injuries alleged to have been
sustained by the deceased as per the confessional statements. It
is further contended that the evidence of the learned J.M.F.C.,
Pattamundai is silent about the precautions which were required
to be taken by at the time of recording of the confessional
statement and therefore, such a confession is no confession in
the eye of law. Learned counsel further contended that the last
seen theory as put forth by the witnesses P.W.1 to P.W.6 cannot
be accepted inasmuch as other boys were also playing with the
deceased and apart from the appellants, there were other
villages present at the place where Astaprahari was going to be
organised. It is further contended that the presence of the
appellants immediately after the occurrence to perform the
Astaprahari for three days proves their innocence. It is further
contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the
recovery of the gunny bag with the black sting with locket as
well as in the Bhanarfala at the instance of          appellants
Nityananda    Sutar  and   Rahas  Behari   Moharana   were   not

                                     17
consonance with section 27 of the Evidence Act and the black
sting with locket which is stated to have been identified by the
witnesses in the test identification parade conducted by P.W.11
was not shown to the identifying witnesses during trial for their
identification and therefore, there is no substantive piece of
evidence in that respect. Learned counsel further contended that
the motive part is also a very weak piece of evidence and the
same has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt and
therefore, in the case of this nature, where the prosecution is
required to prove the circumstances clearly and beyond all
reasonable doubt and further to establish that the chain of
circumstances is so complete that it unerringly points towards
the guilt of the appellants, in absence of such proof, on surmises
and suppositions, the conviction of the appellants is not
sustainable in the eye of law.
             Mr.    Bibekananda       Bhuyan,    learned    Additional
Government Advocate repelling the contentions advanced by the
learned counsel for the appellants, on the other hand supported
the impugned judgment and contended that the extra-judicial
confession as well as the judicial confessional of the appellant
Nityananda Sutar corroborate each other in material particulars
and that in itself is sufficient to convict the appellants. He further

                                  18
emphasized that the other circumstances like last seen, recovery
of different articles also corroborate such confession. He further
contended that the manner in which the ghastly crime was
committed and a five year old boy was sacrificed on superstition,
even if there is no direct evidence but in view of the clinching
trustworthy materials on record, it cannot be said that there is
any infirmity or illegality in the impugned judgment and
therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.
8.           Coming to the nature of death of the deceased, the
doctor P.W.8 who conducted post mortem examination over the
dead body of Sonu has stated to have noticed some lacerated
injuries particularly on the head portion and opined the cause of
death was due to multiple lacerated injuries on scalp, face etc.
with underlined depressed fractures of scalp resulting in severe
brain damage and death and all the injuries were ante mortem in
nature. The post mortem report has been marked as Ext.5. The
learned trial Court has come to a finding that the post mortem
report and the evidence of the witnesses also reveal that the
dead body of Sonu was lying in a Kalam bush and the evidence
of P.W.8 has remained unshaken and his evidence and Ext.5, the
post mortem report clearly establishes that the death of Sonu
was homicidal one. This finding has not been challenged by the

                                  19
learned counsel for the appellants. After perusing the evidence
on record, the inquest report, the post mortem examination
report and the statement of the doctor, we are of the view that
the prosecution has successfully proved the death of the
deceased to be homicidal in nature.
Extrajudicial confession of appellant Nityananda Sutar:
9.           Adverting to the contentions raised at the Bar and
coming first to the extra-judicial confession stated to have been
made before P.W.7, P.W.9 and others, law is well settled that a
confession should always be voluntary and not as a result of
inducement, threat or promise and it should also show as to why
confidence was reposed by the accused on the person before
whom he allegedly made the confession. If there is no intimacy
between the two and no reason is attributed for making such
confession, the Court should be careful enough before accepting
such evidence. An extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of
evidence and the value attached to it would depend upon the
reliability of the person before whom it is made, the interval
between the occurrence and the confession, reproduction of the
exact words of the person making confession to the crime.
             The   occurrence    in  question    took   place  on
05.12.2001, the dead body was recovered on 06.12.2001. The

                                  20
confession was alleged to have been made on 24.01.2002. The
evidence of P.W.7 goes to show that appellant Nityananda Sutar
was hospitalized in Olaver Hospital and S.C.B. Medical College
and Hospital, Cuttack as he attempted to commit suicide by
stabbing himself on the front side of his neck. This evidence was
adduced perhaps to prove that the appellant Nityanada Sutar
repented after commission of the crime for which he made extra-
judicial confession. No medical documents have been proved by
the prosecution to substantiate that the appellant Nityananda
Sutar    was    hospitalized.  The    Investigating  Officer   has
categorically stated that he visited the Olaver Hospital as well as
the S.C.B. Medical College Hospital, Cuttack but he has not
seized any paper relating to the medical treatment of Nityananda
Sutar. Though P.W.7 has stated about the hospitalization of
appellant Nityananda Sutar but it has been confronted to P.W.7
and proved through the I.O. that he has not stated that he
attended Olaver hospital and the appellant Nityananda was not
in a position to talk. Therefore, there is neither any medical
evidence nor oral evidence that appellant Nityananda Sutar was
hospitalized as he attempted to commit suicide after the
occurrence.

                                 21
             The evidence of P.W.7 and P.W.9 indicates that while
they along with others were discussing in front of Takurani
temple as to how the murderers of the deceased could not be
detected, at that point of time the appellant Nityananda Sutar
reached there and made extra-judicial confession. There is
absolutely no material about any close acquaintance or intimacy
of the appellant Nityananda Sutar with any of the persons before
whom the extra-judicial confession was stated to have been
made in a public place except the fact that they were all co-
villagers. The other two who were allegedly present at that point
of time have not been examined in the case. When nobody had
any idea as to how the crime was committed and even after one
and half months of the occurrence, the investigating agency was
clueless about the crime, it creates doubt that all on a sudden
the appellant Nityananda Sutar would come up with an extra-
judicial confession before the co-villagers. There is no evidence
that those villagers were having any status in the society to help
him in any manner rather there was possibility of putting him in
deep trouble. There is absence of any cogent reasons on the part
of the appellant Nityananda Sutar for making a confession of this
nature. The repentance theory as put forth by the prosecution
for prompting the appellant to make the confession is too difficult

                                    22
to be digested. If after so many days of occurrence, the
appellant started repenting and decided to make the commission
of crime public, there was no reason why he should not have
gone to the police immediately after taking such decision and
reported about the same. The choice of persons like P.W.7 and
P.W.9 to confess does not inspire confidence. The possibility of
creating such evidence by the investigating agency just to see
that let the crime not go unpunished after all their endeavour
failed in tracing out the culprits cannot be ruled out.
             In case of Sandeep -Vrs.- State of Haryana
reported in (2001) 20 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 656, it
was held that there was no necessity for the accused to go to the
residence of Laxminarayan, more so when Laxminarayan was not
closely acquainted with the accused nor having any status in the
society so that he could be helpful to them. It was further held
that the prosecution has not brought anything on record to point
out the reason as to why the accused had gone to the house of
Laxminarayan. Accordingly, the confessional statement was not
acted upon.
             In case of Mulak Raj -Vrs.- State of Haryana
reported in 1996(1) Crimes 24 (SC), it is held that when
there is no acquaintance of the accused with the witness, it is

                                  23
unlikely that the accused would confide in the witness and
confess his guilt.
            In case of State of Punjab -Vrs.- Gurdeep Singh
reported in 1999 (4) Crimes 142 (SC), it is held that
disclosure by the accused before a person not so intimate
regarding his involvement in the crime is doubtful.
            It appears from the extra judicial confession that it is
more or less exculpatory in nature. It appears that as if the
appellant Nityananda Sutar was standing as a silent observer at
the place of crime where the other appellants committed the
crime. The overt act which he has attributed to himself in the
extra-judicial confession is that he took the deceased from the
place where he was playing by lifting him and handed over to
appellants Gobardhan Sutar and Rahas Behari Moharana who put
them inside a gunny bag. In the judicial confession (Ext.11), he
has not stated about handing over the deceased to the appellant
Gobardhan Sutar or the co-appellants putting the deceased
inside a gunny bag in his front. The other overt act which he has
attributed to himself in the extra-judicial confession that as per
the direction of appellant Rahas Behari Moharana, he kept the
gold locket inside the gunny bag and threw it inside the bush is
not there in the judicial confession rather in the judicial

                                   24
confession, he has stated that appellant Rahas Behari Moharana
put the black sting with locket inside the gunny bag and threw it
in the stream (Jora) of the river.
             In case of Suresh Budharmal Kalani @ Pappu
Kalani -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in 1998 (4)
Crimes 1 (SC), it is held that a bare perusal of the statement of
the accused makes it abundantly clear that it is self-exculpatory
and hence inadmissible in evidence as ‘confession’.
             In case of Gunanidhi Moharana -Vrs.- State
reported in (1993) 6 Orissa Criminal Reports 158, it is held
that the requirement of section 30 of the Evidence Act is that
before it is made to operate against the co-accused, it should be
strictly established. In other words, what must be before the
Court    should   be  a   confession  proper   and  not  a  mere
circumstance or information which could be an incriminating one.
Secondly, it being the confession of the maker, it is not to be
treated as evidence within the meaning of section 3 of the Act
against the non-maker co-accused and lastly, its use depends on
finding other evidence so as to connect the co-accused with the
crime and that too as a corroborative piece. It is only when the
other evidence tendered against the co-accused unmistakably
points to his guilt then the confession duly proved could be used

                                    25
against such co-accused if it appears to affect him as lending
support or assurance to such other evidence. It is only when a
person admits guilt to the fullest extent and exposes himself to
the pains and penalties provided for his guilt, there is a
guarantee for his truth and the legislature provides that his
statements may be considered against his fellow accused
charged with the same crime. In that case the Hon’ble Judges
after reading Ext.24 which is the confession of accused Gobinda,
held that there was no self-implication and in fact he has tried to
extricate himself by stating that he was merely a witness to the
occurrence and was not a participant.
               In case of Champa Rani Mondal -Vrs.- State of
W.B. reported in 2001 Supreme Court Cases (Criminal)
1514, it is held that exculpatory confession is inadmissible in
evidence and conviction cannot be based on such confession.
               Even though in the extra-judicial confession, it is
stated that one hole was caused on the right ear root of the
deceased and both the confessional statements indicate that the
left little finger nail of the deceased was removed but on perusal
of the post mortem report as well as the evidence of the doctor
(P.W.8), it shows that there was no hole in the ear root of the
deceased except one abrasion just behind the right ear and no

                                  26
injury was noticed on the fingers of either hand. Therefore, the
submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants that the
manner in which the offence alleged to have been committed as
per the extra-judicial confession as well as judicial confession is
not fully corroborated by the medical evidence has got sufficient
force.
             Therefore, in view of the aforesaid discussions, we
are unable to place any reliance on the evidence of P.W.7 and
P.W.9 relating to the extra-judicial confession of appellant
Nityananda Sutar before them.
Judicial confession of appellant Nityananda Sutar before
J.M.F.C., Pattamundai:
10.          P.W.11, learned J.M.F.C., Pattamundai recorded the
confessional statement of Nityananda Sutar vide Ext.11 on
29.01.2002.
             Section   164(2)   of   Cr.P.C. provides    that  the
Magistrate before recording any confession shall explain to the
person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and
that, if he does so, it may be used as evidence against him; and
the confession shall not be recorded unless, upon questioning
the person making it, the Magistrate has reason to believe that it
is being made voluntarily. Section 164(4) of Cr.P.C. states that

                                  27
the confession shall be recorded in the manner provided in
section 281 of Cr.P.C. for recording the examination of an
accused person and shall be signed by the person making the
confession. The Magistrate shall make a memorandum at the
foot of such record that he had explained to the person that he
was not bound to make a confession and that if he does so, any
such confession might be used as evidence against him. The
Magistrate has to make a further memorandum that the
confession was voluntarily made and it was taken in his presence
and hearing and it was read over to the person making it and it
was admitted by the person concerned to be correct and that it
contained a full and true account of the statement made by him.
The learned Magistrate has not stated any such procedure being
followed before recording the confession as per Ext.11. Ext.11
also on the face of it nowhere indicates that any such procedure
as mandated under section 164 of Cr.P.C. has been followed.
The rubber stamp memorandum which is given at the foot of
Ext.11 reads as follows:-
           “Read over and explained to the witness who
            admits to be correct.
                                                  Magistrate”
            Thus it is apparent that the confessional statement
has not been recorded in accordance with law. Chapter VII of the

                                 28
G.R.C.O. (Criminal), Vol-I, Part-I clearly lay down the procedure
for recording the confessions and statements of accused. The
function of the Magistrate in recording confession under section
164 Cr.P.C. is a very solemn act which he is obliged to perform
by taking due care to ensure that all the requirements of section
164 Cr.P.C. are fully satisfied. The Magistrate recording a
confessional statement should not adopt a casual approach and
he must record the confession in the manner as laid down by the
section. Omission to comply with the mandatory provision
renders the confessional statement inadmissible and unreliable.
The defect, if any, while recording such confession cannot be
cured under section 463 of Cr.P.C.
            In case of Nazir Ahmed -Vrs.- King Emperor
reported in AIR 1936 PC 253, which has dealt with recording
of 164 Cr.P.C. statement of accused by Magistrate, it was held
therein that when a power is given to do a certain thing in a
certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all.
The other methods of performance being necessarily forbidden
and the oral evidence of the Magistrate are not admissible.
            In case of Dagdu -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra
reported in A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 1579, it is held that there should
be a strict and faithful compliance with section 164 of Cr.P.C.

                                29
and failure to observe the safeguards prescribed therein are in
practice calculated to impair the evidentiary value of the
confessional statement.
            In case of Dhanajaya Reddy -Vrs.- State of
Karnataka     reported    in  2001    Supreme     Court   Cases
(Criminal) 652, it is held that judicial confession not recorded
in accordance with law cannot be treated as confession.
            In case of Shivappa -Vrs.- State of Karnatak
reported in 1995 (1) Crimes 138, where the statement of the
accused was recorded under section 164 of Cr.P.C. and the
Magistrate did not disclose to the accused that he was a
Magistrate, no inquiry was made to find out whether the accused
had been influenced by anyone, the Magistrate did not lend
assurance to the accused that he would not be sent back to the
police custody in case he did not make confessional statement
and the accused was not questioned as to why he wanted to
make confession, it was held that the same could not be said to
be voluntary and it would not be prudent to act upon such
confessional statement.
            In case of State of Uttar Pradesh -Vrs.- Singhara
Singh and Ors. reported in A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 358, it is held as
follows:-

                                30
          “A Magistrate, therefore, cannot in the course of
          investigation record a confession except in the
          manner laid down in section 164. The power to
          record the confession had obviously been given
          so that the confession might be proved by the
          record of it made in the manner laid down. If
          proof of the confession by other means was
          permissible, the whole provision of section 164
          including the safeguards contained in it for the
          protection of accused persons would be rendered
          nugatory. The section, therefore, by conferring
          on Magistrates the power to record statements
          or   confessions,    by   necessary   implication,
          prohibited a Magistrate from giving oral evidence
          of the statements or confessions made to him.”
          In case of Rabindra Kumar Pal @ Dara Singh
-Vrs.- Republic of India reported in (2011) 48 Orissa
Criminal Reports (SC) 504, it is held as follows:-
         “29. The following principles emerge with regard
          to Section 164 Code of Criminal Procedure:
          (i)  The provisions of Section 164 of Code of
          Criminal Procedure must be complied with not
          only in form, but in essence.
          (ii) Before    proceeding     to    record     the
          confessional statement, a searching enquiry
          must be made from the accused as to the
          custody from which he was produced and the
          treatment he had been receiving in such custody

                       31
in order to ensure that there is no scope for
doubt    of  any   sort  of  extraneous     influence
proceeding from a source interested in the
prosecution.
(iii) A Magistrate should ask the accused as to
why he wants to make a statement which surely
shall go against his interest in the trial.
(iv) The maker should be granted sufficient time
for reflection.
(v) He should be assured of protection from
any sort of apprehended torture or pressure
from the police in case he declines to make a
confessional statement.
(vi) A judicial confession not given voluntarily is
unreliable, more so, when such a confession is
retracted, the conviction cannot be based on
such retracted judicial confession.
(vii) Non-compliance of Section 164 of Code of
Criminal Procedure goes to the root of the
Magistrate's jurisdiction to record the confession
and    renders    the   confession    unworthy     of
credence.
(viii) During the time of reflection, the accused
should be completely out of police influence. The
Judicial Officer, who is entrusted with the duty of
recording confession, must apply his judicial
mind to ascertain and satisfy his conscience that
the statement of the accused is not on account
of any extraneous influence on him.

                                 32
            (ix) At the time of recording the statement of
            the accused, no police or police official shall be
            present in the open Court.
            (x) Confession of a co-accused is a weak type of
            evidence.
            (xi) Usually    the    Court   requires     some
            corroboration from the confessional statement
            before convicting the accused person on such a
            statement.”
            The appellant Nityananda Sutar was produced in
Court after his arrest on 27.01.2002. The order sheet of the
learned J.M.F.C., Pattamundai indicates that on the same day,
the officer in charge of Rajkanika police station prayed for
recording the confessional statement of the appellant but the
appellant  was    remanded    to  custody  till 29.01.2002.    On
29.01.2002 when the appellant was produced from the jail, the
order sheet indicates some procedure was followed and some
questions were put to the appellant and thereafter the learned
Magistrate recorded the confessional statement as per Ext.11.
When the appellant has retracted such confession, it was the
duty of the prosecution to prove all the necessary formalities
before recording such confession. It was the duty of the public
prosecutor to adduce evidence during the examination of the
learned   J.M.F.C.,   Pattamundai    regarding    compliance    of

                                  33
procedural formalities at the time of recording the confession. A
Magistrate recording confession of the accused or holding T.I.
Parade is required to be examined during trial and he is also
required to depose about the procedure followed while recording
confession or holding T.I. Parade. In that event, the accused will
get an opportunity to cross-examine the Magistrate to point out
the lacunas in the procedure adopted. When the evidence of the
learned J.M.F.C., Pattamundai is totally silent on such vital
aspect and Ext.11 in itself does not indicate the compliance of
mandatory requirements, we are not inclined to place any
reliance on such confession.
            If the confession of appellant Nityananda Sutar would
have been believed to be voluntary and true, under section 30 of
the Evidence Act, it could have been used also against the other
appellants but then the question is what would have been its
evidentiary value against the others. The question was succinctly
answered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Kashmira
Singh -Vrs.- State of Madhya Pradesh reported in A.I.R.
1952 S.C. 159 with the following words :
            "The proper way to approach a case of this kind
            is first, to marshal the evidence against the
            accused    excluding  the   confession altogether
            from consideration and see whether, if it is

                                   34
            believed, a conviction could safely be based on
            it. If it is capable of belief independently of the
            confession, then of course it is not necessary to
            call the confession in aid. But cases may arise
            where the judge is not prepared to act on the
            other evidence as it stands even though if
            believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a
            conviction. In such an event, the judge may call
            in   aid   the  confession   and   use  it to  lend
            assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify
            himself in believing what without the aid of the
            confession he would not be prepared to accept."
             In case of Hari Charan Kurmi -Vrs.- State of
Bihar reported in A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1184, it is held that a
confession cannot be treated as evidence which is substantive
evidence against a co-accused person. In dealing with a criminal
case where the prosecution relies upon the confession of one
accused person against another accused person, the proper
approach to adopt is to consider the other evidence against such
an accused person, and if the said evidence appears to be
satisfactory and the Court is inclined to hold that the said
evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said
accused person, the Court turns to the confession with a view to
assure itself that the conclusion which it is inclined to draw from
the other evidence is right. Though confession may be regarded

                                  35
as evidence in that generic sense because of the provisions of
section 30 of the Evidence Act, the fact remains that it is not
evidence as defined by section 3 of the Evidence Act. The result,
therefore, is that in dealing with a case against an accused
person, the Court cannot start with the confession of a co-
accused person; it must begin with other evidence adduced by
the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with regard to
the quality and effect of the said evidence, then it is permissible
to turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the
conclusion of guilty which the judicial mind is about to reach on
the said other evidence. The statements contained in the
confessions of the co-accused persons stand on a different
footing. In cases where such confessions are relied upon by the
prosecution against an accused person, the Court cannot begin
with the examination of the said statements. The stage to
consider the said confession statements arrives only after the
other evidence is considered and found to be satisfactory. The
difference in the approach which the Court has to adopt in
dealing with these two types of evidence is thus clear, well-
understood and well-established.
            Since in view of the glaring infirmities in the extra-
judicial confession as well as judicial confession, we are not

                                   36
inclined to accept such evidence, now it is to be seen whether
the other circumstances have been satisfactorily established by
the prosecution or not and if so, whether those circumstances
are sufficient to establish the guilt of the appellants.
Last seen of the appellants with the deceased:
11.          Coming to the next circumstance adduced by the
prosecution that the appellants were last seen with the deceased
at the place of Astaprahari, the evidence in that respect has been
deposed to by P.W.1 to P.W.6. The evidence of these witnesses
indicates that while the deceased was playing with other children
in front of Mangala temple of the village where a tent was being
erected for Astaprahari Puja, not only the appellants but also the
other villagers were present there. P.W.2 has stated that the
deceased was playing with ten to fifteen other children within the
age group of five to ten years and she has further stated that
twenty to thirty co-villagers were present near the place where
the children were playing. The learned trial Court has come to
the conclusion that since the deceased was playing and the
accused persons were present at the Pendal and they were found
absent soon after the missing of the deceased, that shows the
accused persons and the deceased were last seen together. As
per the evidence of P.W.1, Astaprahari function was celebrated

                                   37
on 5th, 6th and 7th and Palla was held on 7th and the appellants
were very much present there and participated in the function.
It has been confronted to P.W.1 and proved through the
Investigating Officer that she has not stated before him that all
the accused persons except appellant Kartik Chandra Thatoi was
present at the place where tent was being tied. It has been
confronted to P.W.5 and proved through the Investigating Officer
that he has not stated before him that at the time of tying of the
tent, all the accused persons were present there and the
deceased    and    other  children  were playing.   It   has  been
confronted to P.W.6 and proved through the Investigating Officer
that he has not stated before him that all the accused persons
were present at the place where Astaprahari was held and that
while returning, he did not find the accused persons and the
deceased at the place of function.
            In view of such evidence on record, when the other
children were present with the deceased while he was playing
and twenty to thirty persons were also present at the place of
‘Astaprahari’, this circumstance cannot be utilized as last seen of
the appellants in the company of the deceased. The evidence on
record indicates that the appellants were very much available in
the village from the date of occurrence onwards and they

                                   38
participated in the Astaprahari which is another factor to show
their bonafide conduct. Therefore, we are of the view that the
evidence relating to the last seen as held by the trial Court
cannot be accepted.
Recovery of gunny bag and a black string with locket at
the instance of appellant Nityananda Sutar:
12.         Coming to the recovery of gunny bag and the black
string with locket at the instance of appellant Nityananda Sutar,
neither P.W. 7 nor P.W. 9 have stated regarding any statement
made by the appellant Nityananda Sutar in relation to the
recovery of such articles.
            In case of Bhaga Gouda –Vrs.- State reported in
1988(1) Orissa Criminal Reports 400, it is held as follows:
            “What is admissible under Section 27 of the
             Evidence Act is the information received from an
             accused as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
             discovered. In other words, the pre-condition to
             bring Section 27 into operation is that the
             discovery of a fact must be deposed to, and
             thereupon so much of the information as relates
             distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be
             proved. “Information” used in Section 27 means
             the   content   or  substance   of  a  statement.
             Therefore, the exact information given by the
             accused while in custody or in other words, the

                                 39
            statement    made   by   the  accused   must    be
            recorded by the Investigating Officer and if
            pursuant to such information or statement,
            recovery is made, then that information or
            statement becomes admissible under Section
            27.”
            When the discovery statement has not been deposed
to either by P.W.7 or P.W.9, though they have stated about the
extra-judicial confession of the appellant Nityananda Sutar and
though the Investigating Officer has stated that he recorded the
statement of appellant Nityananda Sutar in verbatim before he
led to give recovery of the gunny bag and the locket with string
but no such statement has been marked as exhibit in this case.
Even though in the seizure list Ext.3 which relates to the
recovery of such articles, under the circumstances of seizure, the
confessional statement of appellant Nityananda Sutar has been
recorded but such confessional statement is inadmissible. Even
otherwise also, the recovery of the black string with the locket at
the instance of appellant Nityananda Sutar is no way helpful for
the prosecution inasmuch as though it was placed in the T.I.
Parade conducted by P.W.11 and P.W.11 has stated that the
P.Ws. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 participated in the T.I. parade and they
identified the black string with locket but when all these
witnesses were examined during trial, neither anything was

                                  40
brought out from their evidence that they participated in the T.I.
Parade and identified the black string with locket nor the black
string with locket was shown to them for the purpose of
identification and to mark it as a material object. It was only
proved when P.W.9 was examined. Therefore, the T.I. Parade
report of P.W.11 relating to the identification the black string
with locket as per Ext.17 cannot be accepted as substantive
piece of evidence and therefore, no reliance can be placed on
such recovery.
Recovery of Bhanarfala at the instance of appellant Rahas
Behari Moharana:
13.          It appears  from    the  evidence   P.W.9   that the
Bhanarphala was lying near the mango tree and it was an open
place. P.W.7 has stated that the police brought the accused
persons to the village and they led to the places. The recovery of
Bhanraphala is not in consonance with the provision under
section 27 of the Evidence Act. Therefore, such recovery cannot
be utilized as an incriminating material against the appellant
Rahas Behari Moharana.

                                 41
Motive on the part of the appellants for the commission of
crime:
14.         The last piece of circumstantial evidence which has
been relied upon by the learned trial Court is the motive of the
appellants behind the crime. The learned trial Court has noted
down that since there was degradation of the mental condition of
the son of appellant Gobardhan Sutar, for his betterment, the
crime was committed. The learned trial Court has relied upon the
Ext.A series which have been proved by D.W.3. On perusal of the
evidence of D.W.3, it reveals that he was the physical instructor
of the Saheed Nagar School and he proved the progress reports
of son of the appellant Gobardhan Sutar namely Sanjeeb Sutar
which has been marked as Ext.A series. D.W.3 has specifically
stated that the son of the appellant Gobardhan Sutar was not
mentally unsound and he had also joined the N.C.C. and he was
a smart body. The mark sheets indicates that in the year 1999-
2000, the boy had scored 370 marks and in the year 2000-01,
he had secured 216 marks. So from such evidence, it was not
proper on the part of the learned trial Court to come to a
conclusion that there was degradation of the mental condition of
the son of appellant Gobardhan Sutar which was the motive
behind the commission of the crime.

                                42
Conclusion:
15.           In case of Jaharlal Das -Vrs.- State of Orissa
reported in (1991) 4 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 278, it
is held that in cases depending largely upon circumstantial
evidence, there is always a danger that the conjecture or
suspicion may take the place of legal proof and such suspicion
however so strong cannot be allowed to take the place of proof.
The Court has to be watchful and ensure that conjectures and
suspicions do not take the place of legal proof. The Court must
satisfy itself that the various circumstances in the chain of
evidence should be established clearly and that the completed
chain must be such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the
innocence of the accused. The Court has to be watchful and
avoid the danger of allowing the suspicion to take the place of
legal proof for sometimes unconsciously it may happen to be a
short step between moral certainty and the legal proof. At times
it can be a case of 'may be true' but there is a long mental
distance between 'may be true' and 'must be true' and the same
divides conjectures from sure conclusions.”
            In case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee -Vrs.- State of
West Bengal reported in 1994 (2) Supreme Court Cases
220, it is held as follows:-

                                  43
            “7. It is settled law that in a case based on
            circumstantial evidence, the circumstances from
            which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn have
            not only to be fully established but also that all
            the circumstances so established should be of a
            conclusive nature and consistent only with the
            hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Those
            circumstances should not be capable of being
            explained by any other hypothesis, except the
            guilt of the accused and the chain of the
            evidence must be so complete as not to leave
            any reasonable ground for the belief consistent
            with the innocence of the accused. It needs no
            reminder that legally established circumstances
            and not merely indignation of the court can form
            the basis of conviction and the more serious the
            crime, the greater should be the care taken to
            scrutinize the evidence lest suspicion takes the
            place of proof.”
            In view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the
view that the circumstances have not been established by the
prosecution clearly and beyond all reasonable doubt. We are also
of the view that the circumstances do not form a complete chain
so as to unerringly point towards the guilt of the appellants.
There are several infirmities and irregularities in the investigation
as well as in holding the trial by the public prosecutor. The
reasoning assigned by the learned trial Court in convicting the

                                               44
appellants seems to be based on conjecture and suspicion which
have no place in the matter of legal proof of guilt of accused
persons in a criminal trial and we are of the view that the
impugned verdict is nothing but a sheer moral conviction.
                 Therefore, the impugned judgment and order of
conviction of all the appellants passed by the learned trial Court
and the sentence passed thereunder is not sustainable in the eye
of law and the same is hereby set aside and the appellants are
acquitted of all the charges.
16.              In the result, all the three appeals are allowed. It
appears       that      the   appellants        Rahas Behari    Moharana         and
Nityananda Sutar are in jail custody. They shall be set at liberty
forthwith, if their detention is not required in any other case. So
far as appellants Gobardhan Sutar and Kartik Chandra Thatoi are
concerned, they are on bail by virtue of the orders of this Court.
They are discharged from liability of their bail bonds. The
personal bonds and the surety bonds stand cancelled.
