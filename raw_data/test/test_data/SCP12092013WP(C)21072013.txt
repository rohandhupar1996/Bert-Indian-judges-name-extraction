                         WP (C) NO.2107 OF 2013
06 12.09.2013         Heard learned counsel for the parties.
                      This writ petition has been filed challenging the Final
              Assessment Order, dated 16.07.2012 (Annexure-3), under
              which the petitioner has been directed to pay an amount of
              Rs.1,23,147/- towards electricity charges.
                      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that after
              issue of the Final Assessment order, the petitioner has
              already deposited Rs.50,000/- on 08.08.2012, as per
              Annexure-4, a further amount of Rs.30,000/- as per
              Annexure-9 and a sum of Rs.20,000/- pursuant to the
              order of this Court dated 05.02.2013, passed in Misc.Case
              No.1948 of 2013. It is submitted that as the petitioner has
              already paid Rs.1,00,000/-(rupees one lakh), he may be
              permitted to approach the Executive Engineer (Electrical)-
              opposite party no.1, to reconsider the electricity charges
              imposed, which according to the petitioner is not proper
              and justified. It is further submitted that the amount of
              Rs.16,750/- has been illegally charged in each month from
              August, 2012 to November, 2012.
                      Learned counsel appearing for the opposite parties,
              with reference to the counter affidavit filed submits that as
              the Final Assessment proceeding has been completed in
              presence of the petitioner and on his consent, he is not
              permitted to question the same. Further, it is fairly
              submitted that as the petitioner has already deposited a
              substantial amount subsequent to the order of Final

                      2
Assessment, he may approach the Executive Engineer
(Electrical), Cuttack-opposite party no.1 for redressal of his
grievance.
        Considering the submissions made, the writ petition
is disposed of directing the petitioner to approach the
Executive Engineer (Electrical)-opposite party no.1, by
filing a representation with regard to the excess electric
charges. If such a representation is filed by the petitioner
within two weeks hence along with a copy of this order, the
Executive Engineer (Electrical)-opposite party no.1 shall
consider    and   dispose   of  the  same   expeditiously,   in
accordance with law, after hearing to the petitioner.
        Till a decision is taken on the representation of the
petitioner, no coercive action shall be taken for recovery of
the amount under the Final Assessment Order.
        The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
        Issue urgent certified copy as per rules.
                                             (S.C.PARIJA, J.)
