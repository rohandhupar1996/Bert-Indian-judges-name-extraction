                                                 AND
                        THE HON’BLE KUMARI JUSTICE S. PANDA
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Date of hearing & judgment : 16.04.2010
PRADIP MOHANTY, J.         This appeal is directed against the judgment and
        order dated 14.02.2001 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
        Judge, Jeypore in S.C. Case No.32 of 1999 convicting the appellant
        under     Section     302,    I.P.C.    and    sentencing      him     to   undergo
        imprisonment for life.
        2.                 The prosecution case in brief is that on 18.02.1999
        Kondagori Taudu (P.W.2) lodged FIR before the A.S.I., Bondhugaon
        Out-post alleging therein that on 16.02.1999 at about 7 P.M., the
        accused-appellant dealt an axe blow on the chest of the deceased-
        Kondagiri Gumpha causing severe bleeding injury. On the next day,
        the deceased succumbed to the injury. The A.S.I. of police dispatched

                               2
the FIR to Narayanpatna P.S. for registration and accordingly the
case was registered and investigation taken up. During the course of
investigation, police examined the witnesses and recorded their
statements, seized the wearing apparels of the accused and the
weapon of offence, sent the dead body for post mortem examination
and upon completion of investigation submitted charge-sheet against
the appellant under Section 302, IPC.
3.              Plea of the appellant is complete denial of the
allegation. His specific plea is that P.W.1 has committed the murder
of the deceased.
4.              The prosecution in order to prove the charge examined
as many as twelve witnesses including the I.Os. and the doctor and
exhibited 13 documents. Defence examined none.
5.              Mrs. Das, learned counsel for the appellant assails the
impugned judgment on the following grounds:
          (i)   The trial court has convicted the appellant
                solely basing upon the evidence of P.W.1,
                who is not an independent witness. There is
                major    contradiction   in   his  statement
                regarding the assault. Conviction of the
                appellant based on the evidence of a solitary
                eye-witness cannot be sustained in absence
                of any independent corroboration.
          (ii)  The alleged dying declaration made by the
                deceased is a very weak piece of evidence
                and is not believable.
          (iii) There is delay in lodging the FIR.

                              3
          (iv)  The act committed by the appellant would
                at best come within the purview of Section
                304-II IPC.
6.              Mr. Nayak, learned Additional Government Advocate
vehemently contends that P.W.1 is an eye witness and his evidence is
very clear and cogent to establish the guilt of the appellant. He has
no relationship with the deceased. The deceased had made the dying
declaration before P.Ws.1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 to the effect that the
appellant had assaulted him. Moreover, the appellant confessed
before the villagers that he had committed murder of the deceased.
Therefore, the impugned judgment needs no interference by this
Court.
7.              Perused the L.C.R. P.W.1 is a witness to the
occurrence and a neighbour of both the deceased and the appellant.
He deposed that the occurrence took place on a Tuesday at about 7
P.M. Two days prior to the occurrence on a Sunday the deceased and
the appellant had quarrelled with each other in a village meeting. The
villagers present in the meeting intervened and separated them. He
further stated that at the time of occurrence he was taking bath just
outside his own house. When the deceased was urinating, the
appellant dealt an axe blow on the left side chest of the deceased, as
a result of which the deceased fell down sustaining bleeding injury on
his chest. Seeing this, he raised hullah. The appellant then dropped
the axe there and fled away. Hearing his hullah, P.Ws.4 and 5, one
Kadraka Gouri and others came to the spot. They shifted the
deceased to his house. In his house the deceased declared before the
villagers that the appellant had assaulted him.      On the following
Wednesday, the deceased succumbed to the injuries in the village
and on Thursday P.W.2 reported the matter before the police.        On
arrival of the police, he produced the weapon of offence, i.e., Tangia
M.O.I, who seized the same. Nothing has been elicited by the defence
in cross-examination to discredit his testimony. P.W.2 is the

                               4
informant and a post-occurrence witness. He deposed that P.W.1
informed him about the assault given by the appellant to the
deceased by means of a knife. Getting such information, he went to
the house of the deceased and found him sustaining one injury on
his chest. Some other villagers were also present at that time. The
deceased declared before him that the appellant had assaulted him
on his chest by means of an axe. On the following Wednesday the
deceased succumbed to the injury. On the next day, i.e., on
Thursday, he went to the Police Station and reported the matter.
Ext.1 is the F.I.R. and Ext.1/1 is his signature thereon. He further
stated that the police held inquest over the dead body of the deceased
in his presence. Ext.2 is the inquest report and Ext.2/1 is his
signature thereon. P.W.3 is a co-villager, who supported the version
of P.W.2 regarding inquest. He put his L.T.I. on the said inquest
report. He also admitted in his cross-examination that no blood-
stained earth or sample earth was seized from the backside of P.W.1’s
house. But no materials are forthcoming to demolish his evidence.
P.W.4 is a co-villager and a post-occurrence witness, who supported
the version of P.W.2. P.W.5 is another co-villager and an immediate
post-occurrence witness, who also supported the version of P.W.2
and further stated about the dying declaration made by the deceased.
P.W.6 also supported the version of P.Ws.2 and 4. Nothing has been
elicited by the defence during cross-examination to demolish the
evidence of P.Ws.5 and 6. P.W.7 is the scribe of the F.I.R. and put his
signature Ext.1/2. He also gave an endorsement at the bottom of the
F.I.R. that he read over and explained the contents of the F.I.R. to the
informant (P.W.2). P.W.8 is a co-villager and a post-occurrence
witness. He supported the version of P.W.6. P.W.9 is a constable and
a witness to the seizure of the wearing apparels of the deceased and
command certificate of Ram Chandra Majhi C/35. P.W.10 is the I.O.,
who initially investigated into the matter. P.W.11 is the S.I. of Police
who was in charge of Bondhugaon Out-post at the relevant point of
time. He took charge of the investigation from P.W.10 and submitted

                                5
charge-sheet. P.W.12 is the doctor who conducted autopsy and found
the following external injury on the body of the deceased.
       “(i) One stab wound of the size 2” length X depth 3”,
                 situated over the left chest 1” below the left
                 clavical just lateral to sternal margin. The
                 injury was obliquely placed.”
On dissection he found the following internal injury corresponding to
the external injury.
        “(i)     The second costal cartilage, the 3rd rib at
                 the costo junction, the left bronchus, left
                 lung along with plura, intra costal vessels,
                 inter costal muscles were cut.”
He opined that the injury was ante-mortem in nature and was
sufficient to cause death. Death was due to hypovolumic shock
resulting from the above injury. He also stated that the injury found
on the deceased cannot be possible if the axe blow is given on the
deceased from his backside. Nothing has been elicited from his cross-
examination by the defence to demolish his evidence.
8.               From the above analysis of the evidence, It is crystal
clear that P.W.1 is the solitary eye witness and there is no material to
disbelieve his evidence. Though some minor discrepancies are there
in his evidence, the same are not very significant. His evidence is
supported by the medical evidence. P.Ws.3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 also stated
about the dying declaration made by the deceased. P.W.8 also stated
about the extra-judicial confession made by the appellant in presence
of witnesses. Taking into consideration the medical evidence, dying
declaration and the extra-judicial confession made by the appellant,
there is no dispute that the appellant was the assailant of the
deceased. In the instant case, since the appellant gave only one blow
with an axe on the chest of the deceased, the intention to cause death
cannot be imputed to him, and it would be reasonable to infer that he
had the knowledge that such injury on the vital part of the body of
the deceased would cause death.        By applying the ratio decided in

                                 6
Sanyasi Palasi @ Sania Vrs. State of Orissa, (2009) 44 OCR-236,
this Court is of the considered opinion that the act committed by the
appellant squarely comes under the purview of Section 304-II I.P.C.
9.                In the result, the appeal is allowed in part. The
conviction of the appellant under Section 302 I.P.C. passed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jeypore in S.C. No.32 of 1999 is
converted to one under Section 304-II I.P.C. and he is sentenced to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for eight years.
                  It is stated by Mrs. Das, learned counsel for the
appellant that the appellant is in custody from the date of his arrest
and by now has completed more than eleven years. If that be so, the
appellant be set at liberty forthwith, unless his detention is required
otherwise.

                                      7
Therefore, this Court sets aside the judgment and order of his conviction
under Section 302 I.P.C., as passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Koraput-Jeypore. Instead, this Court convicts him under Section
304-II I.P.C. and sentence him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for
eight years.
