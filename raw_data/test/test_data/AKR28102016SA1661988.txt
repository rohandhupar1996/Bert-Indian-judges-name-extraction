     PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
     Date of Hearing: 21.10.2016      &     Date of Judgment: 28.10.2016
DR.A.K.RATH, J.     This is an appeal against the judgment and decree
     dated   31.3.1988   and   16.4.1988     respectively of  the  learned
     Additional District Judge, Bhadrak in Title Appeal No.19/299 of
     1978/87 confirming the judgment and decree dated 20.7.1978 and
     27.7.1978 respectively passed by the learned Munsif, Bhadrak in
     O.S. No.28 of 1975-I.

                                     2
2.            The plaintiffs instituted a suit for declaration that the
decrees passed in O.S.No.169 of 1955-I and O.S.No.303 of 1964-I do
not affect the interest of them in the suit property as they were not
made     parties  in  those   suits    and for  permanent    injunction
restraining the defendants not to interfere with the possession of
plaintiffs over the suit properties.
3.            The case of the plaintiffs is that the suit land is the
ancestral homestead land of their grandfather, Netra Mahalik. After
death of Netra, the suit land was recorded in the name of their
father, Ekadashi Mahalik and his elder brother, Nisakar Mahalik in
C.S. record of right. Ankur Mahalik, father of defendant nos.2 to 6
and his brother Sankar Mahalik were recorded as sikimi tenants in
C.S. operation ; but they were never in possession. The ancestors of
the plaintiffs and, thereafter the plaintiffs are in possession. Ankur
and his brother Sankar had filed O.S. No.169 of 1955-I in the court
of the learned Munsif, Bhadrak against the father of the plaintiffs
without impleading the plaintiffs, who were major then.               A
compromise was entered into between them. After death of Ankur
and Sankar, defendant nos.1 to 6 had filed O.S.No.303 of 1964-I for
partition. They were not parties to the said suit. They came to know
about O.S.No.169 of 1955-I on 28.2.1975 when the Commissioner
went to deliver possession in Execution Case no.30 of 1970.
4.            Pursuant to issuance of notice, defendants 1 to 6
entered appearance and filed written statement. The case of the
defendants was that Kali Mahalik, the grandfather of defendant
nos.2 to 6 and his brother, Dhoi Mahalik were recorded as sikimi
tenants in respect of Ac.0.15 decimals of land appertaining to suit
plot no.1876. Nisakar and his brother Ekadasi (father of the

                                    3
plaintiffs) were the stihitiban tenants. In O.S.No.169 of 1955-I, a
compromise was entered into, by which Ac.0.14 decimals of land
towards south of the suit plot no.1876 was allotted to the share of
Ankur and Sankar, whereas Ac.0.01 decimals of land towards south
of the suit plot no.1876 was allotted to the share of defendants No.
7, 9, 10 and one Gangadhar, brother of defendant no.10. O.S. No.
303 of 1964-I was filed for partition of the suit properties, in which
their title was declared. Defendant No.7 was in good state of mind.
The compromise decree passed in O.S.No.169 of 1955-I was not
fraudulent. The defendant nos. 7 to 10 have been set ex parte.
5.           On the inter se pleadings of the parties, the learned trial
court struck eight issues, which are quoted hereunder:-
       1.          Have the plaintiffs any cause of action ?
       2.          Were Kali Mahalik, Dhoi Mahalik                not    in
                   possession of the suit land as alleged ?
       3.          Were the plaintiffs major          at   the   time    of
                   O.S.No.169 of 1955-I ?
       4.          Did the defendant no.7 represent the plaintiffs in
                   O.S.No.169 of 1955-I and O.S.No.303 of 1964-I as
                   Karta of the joint family ?
       5.          Was the compromise in O.S.No.169 of 1955-I
                   effected fraudulently by Ankur and Sankar ?
       6.          Are the plaintiffs separate from their parents and
                   if so when ?
       7.          Have the plaintiffs any right, title, interest and
                   possession in the suit land ?
       8.          To what relief, if any, the plaintiffs are entitled ?

                                    4
6.           The learned trial court came to hold that the admission
of P.W.1 completely belies the allegation of fraud. The plaintiffs have
failed to discharge the onus. Findings of the earlier judgment in
O.S.No.303 of 1964-I would operate as res-judicata since Issue no.5
of the suit was directly and substantially in issue in an earlier suit
between the same parties and, accordingly, answered Issue No.5
against the plaintiffs. It further held that the plaintiffs had failed to
prove separation by clear, cogent and impeccable evidence and the
said issue was answered against the plaintiffs. It further held that
the plaintiffs had not adduced any evidence that they had attained
majority in the year 1955. Accordingly, Issue no.3 was answered
against the plaintiffs. The defendant no.7 cannot be said to be a
man or mentally deranged person. Accordingly Issue no.4 was
answered against the plaintiffs. With regard to Issue nos. 2 and 7,
the learned trial court held that the plaintiffs had failed to prove
their possession over the suit land. On the other hand, the
contesting defendants have produced the documentary evidence to
prove their continuous and uninterrupted possession of the suit
land. The forefathers of the defendants had perfected title by virtue
of Section 236 of Orissa Tenancy Act. Held so, the learned trial
court decreed the suit. The plaintiffs have unsuccessfully challenged
the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court before the
learned Additional District Judge in Title Appeal No.19/299 of
1978/87, which was eventually dismissed.
7.           The second appeal was admitted on 4.9.1990 to answer
the substantial questions of law enumerated in paragraphs 3 (A)
and 3 (B) and ground no.5 of the memorandum of appeal. However,
paragraphs 3 (A) and 3 (B) are findings of the lower appellate court.

                                     5
The substantial question of law enumerated in ground no.5 of the
memorandum of appeal is as follows:-
             “5.    For that the defendant no.7 was not impleaded as
             the Karta of the family consisting of the defendant no.7
             and the present plaintiff-appellants in the O.S.No.169 of
             1955 and O.S.No.303 of 1964 and as such the decree
             passed in both the suits cannot bind the appellants.
             (Section 253 of Hindu Law by Mulla) and the interest of
             the plaintiffs remained ineffective when they were not
             made parties to the suits.”
8.           0.S.No.169 of 1955-I was instituted by Ankur Mahalik
and Sankar Mahalik son of Kali Mahalik against Ekadasi Mahalik
son of Netra Mahalik, Sukadei and Golak Mahalik (widow and son of
Nisakar) in the court of the learned Munsif, Bhadrak. The suit was
decreed. Though the plaintiffs assert that they were major at the
time of institution of the suit, but then they have not challenged the
judgment and decree dated 19.11.1956 and 30.11.1956 respectively
passed in O.S.No.169 of 1955-1. Section 59 of the Limitation Act
applies to a suit setting aside the decree either on the ground of
fraud or any other ground. The period of limitation is three years.
The judgment and decree in O.S.No.169 of 1955-I has not been
challenged within the prescribed period of limitation.
9.             In the State of Kerala Vrs. M.K. Kunhikannan
Nambiar, AIR 1996 S.C. 906. The apex Court held that even a void
order or decision rendered between parties cannot be said to be
non-existent in all cases and in all situations. Ordinarily, such an
order will, in fact be effective inter parties until it is successfully
avoided or challenged in higher forum. Mere use of the word "void"
is not daterminative of its legal impact. The word "void" has a
relative rather than an absolute meaning. It only conveys the idea
that the order is invalid or illegal. It can be avoided. There are

                                       6
degrees of invalidity, depending upon the gravity of the infirmity, as
to whether it is, fundamental or otherwise. The apex Court went in
depth into the jurisprudential concept of ‘void’ and ‘voidable’ and
held thus :
              “7. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th edition, (Reissue)
      Volume 1(1) in paragraph 26, page 31, it is stated, thus:-
                     "If an act or decision, or an order or other instrument
              is invalid, it should, in principle, be null and void for all
              purposes; and it has been said that there are no degrees of
              nullity. Even though such an act is wrong and lacking in
              jurisdiction, however, it subsists and remains fully effective
              unless and until it is set aside by a court of competent
              jurisdiction. Until its validity is challenged, its legality is
              preserved."
              In the Judicial Review of Administrative Action, De Smith.
      Woolf and Jowell, 1995 edition. at pages 259-260 the law is stated,
      thus:-
              "The erosion of the distinction between jurisdictional errors
      and non-jurisdictional errors has, as we have seen, correspondingly
      eroded the distinction between void and voidable decisions. The
      courts have become increasingly impatient with the distinction, to
      the extent that the situation today can be summarised as follows:
              (1) All official decisions are presumed to be valid until set
      aside or otherwise held to be invalid by a court of competent
      Jurisdiction."
              Similarly, Wade and Forsyth in Administrative Law, Seventh
      edition- 1994, have stated the law thus at pages 341-342:-
              "…….every unlawful administrative act, however invalid, is
      merely voidable. But this is no more than the truism that in most
      situations the only way to resist unlawful action is by recourse to
      the law. In a well-known passage Lord Racliffe said:
              An order, even if not made in good faith, is still an act
      capable of legal consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity upon
      its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to
      establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise
      upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the
      most impeccable of orders.

                                         7
               This must be equally true even where the brand of invalidity
        is plainly visible: for there also the order can effectively be resisted
        in law only by obtaining the decision of the court. The necessity of
        recourse to the court has been pointed out repeatedly in the House
        of Lords and Privy Council without distinction between patent and
        latent defects."
10.            In view of the authoritative pronouncement of the apex
Court in the case of M.K. Kunhikannan Nambiar (supra), the
inescapable conclusion is that the plaintiffs are bound by the
judgment and decree passed in O.S.No.169 of 1955-I. In the
subsequent suit i.e., O.S.No.303 of 1964-I filed by the legal heirs of
Ankur and Sankar for partition, the plaintiffs are neither necessary
nor proper parties.
11.            In the result, the appeal is dismissed. No costs.
                                                    ……..…………………..
