       PRESENT:
                        THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
       Date of hearing : 29.09.2014             :         Date of judgment :    29.09.2014
Dr. A.K.Rath, J      By this writ petition, the petitioners have prayed, inter alia, to quash
       the punishment of blacklisting and allow them to continue as approved valuers.
       2.            Bereft of unnecessary details, the short facts of the case of the
       petitioners are that petitioner no.1 is a partnership firm registered under the Indian
       Partnership Act, 1932 and petitioner no.2 is the Managing Partner of the said firm.
       The petitioners were appointed as registered valuer in respect of M/s.East End
       Engineering Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Orissa Textile Mills pursuant to the order of the
       learned Company Judge of this Court. They were empanelled by the State Bank of
       India and different Nationalized Banks. When no work was assigned to them,
       petitioner no.2 made an enquiry. He came to know that the firm has been blacklisted
       by the Indian Banks’ Association. Thereafter, an application was made to the Public
       Information Officer, Circle Office, Punjab National Bank under the provisions of the
       Right to Information Act for supply of detailed information. On 23.5.2014, the

                                            2
Public Information Officer, Punjab National Bank supplied information, vide
Annexure-11 series, wherein it is evident that the Indian Banks’ Association in its
letter dated 18.02.2014, found the petitioners guilty in indulging malpractices while
submitting their valuation reports to the State Bank of India and blacklisted. By
letter dated 11.03.2014, the Deputy General Manager, Recovery Division, Punjab
National Bank, opposite party no.2, directed to all the Circle Office not to assign any
work to the blacklisted valuers.
3.             Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has been filed by the
opposite parties. The sum and substance of the case of the opposite parties is that the
petitioners were empanelled as a valuer of the opposite parties. An agreement to that
effect was entered into between the petitioners and the opposite parties, vide
Annexure-A. The Indian Banks’ Association reported the names of 25 valuers
involved in the fraud. The Head Office Punjab National Bank, New Delhi circulated
blacklisted valuers, wherein the name of the petitioners finds place along with
others. In view of the same, the Circle Office of the Bank directed all the branches
not to assign any valuation to the blacklisted valuers.
4.             Heard Mr.U.C.Pattnaik, learned counsel for the petitioners and
Mr.A.K.Jena, learned counsel for the opposite parties 2 and 3.
5.             Mr.Pattnaik, learned counsel for the petitioners, submits that before
blacklisting the petitioners, no opportunity of hearing was provided to them. He
further submits that the Indian Banks’ Association had never called upon the
petitioners to answer the charges levelled against them. The petitioners have been
deprived of their vital and valuable rights to defend themselves.
6.             Per contra, Mr.Jena, learned counsel for the opposite parties 2 and 3,
submits that the Indian Banks’ Association had sent a letter on 18.2.2014 to the
Chief Executives of all Banks annexing therein the names of 25 valuers who had
found guilty for indulging in malpractices while submitting their valuation reports.
The name of the petitioners found place in the said list. Basing on the said report,
opposite party no.2 directed the Circle Office not to assign any work to the
blacklisted valuers.

                                                 3
7.             The immortal jurist Roscoe Pound whose ‘Jurisprudence’ will surpass
all ages said of reputation:
               “On the one hand there is the claim of the individual to be secured in his
               dignity and honour as part of his personality in a world in which one must
               live in society among his fellow men. On the other hand there is the claim to
               be secured in his reputation as a part of his substance, in that in a world in
               which credit plays so large a part the confidence and esteem of one’s fellow-
               men may be a valuable asset.” (See : “Interest of Personality” – 28 Harvard
               Law Review, pp. 445, 447).
8.             In M/s. Erusian Equipment and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West
Bengal and another, AIR 1975 SC 266, the apex Court in para-20 of the report held
as under :
                “20. Blacklisting has the effect of preventing a person from the privilege
                and advantage of entering into lawful relationship with the Government for
                purposes of gains. The fact that a disability is created by the order of
                blacklisting indicates that the relevant authority is to have an objective
                satisfaction. Fundamentals of fair play require that the person concerned
                should be given an opportunity to represent his case before he is put on the
                blacklist.”
9.             The same view was echoed in Joseph Vilangandan v. The Executive
Engineer (P.W.D.), Ernakulam and others, AIR 1978 SC 930 and Raghunath Thakur
v. State of Bihar and others AIR 1989 SC 620.
10.            Indisputably, no notice had been given to the petitioners before
blacklisting. As the impugned order cast a stigma on the reputation of the petitioners,
which is both an interest of personality and an interest of substance and as it is
attended with civil consequences, the same should have been proceeded by notice
and an opportunity to represent their cases.
               In the wake of the aforesaid, the order blacklisting the petitioners is
hereby quashed. No costs.
                                                                        ………………………..
                                                                         DR. A.K.RATH, J.
Orissa High Court, Cuttack.
The 29th September, 2014/PKS.
