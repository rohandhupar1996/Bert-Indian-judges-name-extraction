S.Pujahari, J.              Judgment and order dated 20.11.2004 passed by
     the learned Sessions Judge, Koraput at Jeypore in Criminal Trial
     No.275 of 2003, convicting the appellant (hereinafter referred to as
     “the accused”) for committing murder of his wife (hereinafter
     referred to as “the deceased”) under Section 302, I.P.C., and
     sentencing him to undergo R.I. for life, are assailed in this Jail
     Criminal Appeal by the accused, presently lodged in the District
     Jail, Koraput to undergo the sentence.
     2.              The prosecution placed before the trial court a case
     that 16.02.2003, a Sunday, was a weekly fair day at village
     Semiliguda. The accused along with the deceased had been to that

                                      2
weekly fair to market sundry goods. After the marketing, both of
them left for their village. But, on their way back to   home,   at
about    7.30  P.M.,    near   Dompanigadha ‘Dangar’ (a hillock) of
village-Mukhi Bidei, both of them had an altercation which led to a
fight between them. The accused overpowered the deceased and
pinned down her to the ground and mercilessly assaulted her on
her face and head with a lathi and stone and caused severe
bleeding injuries for which she lost her sense. Then the accused
dragged her to a little distance i.e. to near Dompanigada “Nala”
(stream of water) and found her to have succumbed to the injuries.
The accused, however, guarded her dead body there throughout
the night. On the next day morning, when people found him
sitting near her dead body, he confessed before them to have killed
the deceased during course of mutual fight between them. The
matter was reported to the police at Semiliguda Police Station by
the Ward Member, namely, Shyam Sundar Majhi(P.W.1) in writing
(Ext.1), pursuant to which Semiluguda P.S. Case No.23 of 2003
was registered. The police investigated the matter and found
substance in the allegation inasmuch as the investigation
indicated that the accused was the author of the crime and as
such the police placed charge-sheet against the accused for
commission of offence punishable under Section 302 of the I.P.C.
Learned S.D.J.M., Koraput also took cognizance of the same and
finding the case to be triable by the Court of Sessions, committed
the same. Hence, the accused be proceeded for committing the
murder of the deceased.
3.          Learned Sessions Judge, Koraput at Jeypore, placing
reliance on the aforesaid case of the prosecution which was also
supported by the materials collected by the police during

                                   3
investigation, framed charge under Section 302 of the I.P.C.
against the accused. But the accused pleaded not guilty of
the charge and faced trial. The prosecution examined as many as
10 witnesses besides exhibiting certain documents and also
material objects to establish the charge against the accused. The
accused who took a plea of denial and false implication, did not
adduce any independent evidence in support of such plea. The
trial court on conclusion of the trial, appreciating the evidence
adduced by the prosecution, returned the judgment of conviction
and order of sentence as stated earlier.
4.          Learned counsel for the accused though did not
dispute that the deceased died a homicidal death, but submitted
that there being no credible evidence on record indicating the fact
that the accused was the author of the crime, the trial court erred
in recording the judgment of conviction and order of sentence as
stated earlier.
5.          Elaborating the submission, it has been submitted by
the learned counsel for the accused that the trial court on a wrong
premises relied on the confession of the accused said to have been
made while in police custody, though Sections 25 and 26 of the
Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) prohibits
the use of the same. No doubt Section 27 of the Act allows some
confession while in police custody to be led into evidence in spite
of prohibition in the preceding Sections 25 and 26 of the Act, but
the same must be distinctly relatable to the fact discovered. The
confession before the police relied on here in this case being not
covered by the aforesaid exception, the trial court should not have
placed reliance on the same resorting the mandate of Section 27 of
the Act. When the aforesaid confession is effaced off the record

                                     4
being hit by Section 25 of the Act, the other circumstance
available against the accused is recovery of the weapons of offence
from the place of concealment which by itself is not sufficient
to form the foundation for conviction. In such            premises, he
submits the accused is entitled to a judgment and order of
acquittal.
6.          Per contra, drawing notice of the Court to the evidence
on record, it has been submitted by the learned counsel for the
State that there is ample evidence on record indicating the fact
that the deceased died a homicidal death while in the company of
the accused and the accused had no explanation for the same. The
same itself is a strong incriminating circumstance. Coupled with
the same, when the accused had given information to have
concealed the material objects which were found to be the
weapons of offence, there is no manner of doubt that it was the
accused who authored the death of the deceased, even if the
confession made while in police custody that was taken into
consideration by the trial court, is effaced off the record for having
no legal sanction.
7.          The evidence on record as placed before the trial court
indicates that the death of the deceased was homicidal in nature.
The doctor (P.W.8) who conducted the post-mortem examination of
the deceased, deposed to have found the following injuries on the
person of the deceased during post-mortem examination:
            “External injuries:-
      i.     A lacerated wound of size 1 cm. x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm. over the
           lateral side of left eye.

                                         5
      ii.    Lacerated wound of size 0.5 c.m. x 0.5 cm x bone depth over
             the root of nose with fracture of                 nasal bone.
      iii.   Rapture of the left eye bail with                 rent     over

      iv.    Peri-orbital swelling of both the eye.
      v.     Multiple abrasions (25 in numbers) over the face each of
             sizes 1 cm. x 0.3 cm.
      vi.    Bruise of size 3 cm. and dia metre over the right pinna.
      vii.   Abrasion below the right ear over the neck of size 2 cm. x 2

      viii. Bruise 2 cm. and dia-metre behind the left ear.
      ix.    3 bruises over the right fore-head each of size 1 cm. and
             dia-metre with underlying fracture of right frontal bone and
             an epidural haematoma of size 2 cm x 2 cm. x 0.5 cm.
             Corresponding membrance and the frontal lobe of the right
             hemisphear were also bruised.
      x.     Abrasion of size 5 cm. x 2 cm.over the anterior chest wall
             (right) in upper half.
      xi.    Abrasion of size 4 cm. x 1 cm. over the right axilla.
      xii.   Abrasion of size 1 cm. x 1 cm. over the right shoulder.
      xiii. Abrasion of size 3 cm. x 1.5 cm. over the anterior chest wall
             in lower 1/3rd.
      xiv. Lacerated wound over the anterior superior iliac spine of
             size 1 cm x 1 cm. x Muscle depth.
      xv.    3 abrasions each of size 0.5 cm. x 0.5 cm. over the posterior
             surface of right elbow.
      xvi. Two parallel bruise each of seize 4 cm. x 0.5 cm. with inter-
             vening bend of normal skin of size 0.5 cm bredth over the
             lateral aspect of right upper thigh oriented horizontally.
      xvii. Two parallel bruises each of size 10 cm. x 0.5 cm. with
             intervening bend of normal skin of 0.5 cm. bredth over the
             anterior surface of left thigh.
      xviii. Abrasion over the right knee anteriorily of size 4 c.m. x 3
             c.m.
      xix. Two abrasions one on each side of L-5. pinous process each
             of size 1.5 c.m. x 1 c.m.
      xx.    Haemotama over the occipital area of skull circular in shape
             of 3 c.m. and dia metre with brusing of underlying
             membrance and occipital lobes of both hemisphere.”,
According     to   this   doctor,    all   the  aforesaid  injuries     were
antemortem in nature and the death of the deceased was
attributable to the injuries on the head which was sufficient in

                                    6
ordinary course of nature to cause death. The doctor had also
prepared the post-mortem examination report                   (Ext.9),
contemporaneous to his such examination. The        aforesaid    post-
mortem examination report (Ext.9) as such corroborates the
version of the doctor in the court. Nothing has been elicited in the
cross-examination of the doctor to indicate that the aforesaid
injuries are suicidal or accidental in nature inasmuch as the
doctor has flatly denied the suggestion given that the injuries
could be possible by fall on hard and rough surface and looking
into the situs and gravity of some of the injuries, possibility of the
same being self inflicted is ruled out. No material was brought to
record contrary to the evidence of the doctor. No material has also
been placed before the court that the doctor had not bestowed the
required    care  and   caution   while  conducting     post-mortem
examination. In such premises, the finding of the court below that
the death of the deceased was attributable to the injuries noticed
by the doctor which is also not disputed in this appeal by the
accused, appears to be based on credible evidence on record, as
such needs no interference. The injuries being homicidal in nature
as such the deceased died a homicidal death.
8.           So far as author of such homicidal death of the
deceased is concerned, there is no manner of doubt that the
evidence of the informant (P.W.1) indicates that on the day
following the incident at about 9.00 A.M., the accused was found
near the dead body of the deceased Dalimba Oyal near Damapani
Gada Pada and there was bleeding from her nose and mouth.
Thereafter, ascertaining the cause of death from the accused PW-1
stated to have lodged report (Ext.1) scribed by another. This
witness in his statement has never deposed anything indicating

                                    7
the fact that the death of the deceased occurred in the company of
the accused and he made any confession before             him.    The
aforesaid circumstance as such is not at all        incriminating  to
the accused.
9.          The investigating officer (P.W.9) in his evidence deposed
that after registration of the case on the basis of the information
received vide Ext.1, he conducted investigation and during the
course of investigation, as it appears from his evidence, he seized a
piece of stone (M.O.IV) and a lathi (M.O.V) consequent to the
accused showing the place of concealment after making confession
before him that he murdered the deceased by assaulting her with
the stone (M.O.IV) and lathi (M.O.V) and after such murder he had
thrown away the said lathi and stone at a little distance from the
assault place in a concealed manner and also he proved the
aforesaid statement recorded by him as Ext.5/1.
            It appears that the trial court held such confession of
the accused while in police custody to be admissible under Section
27 of the Act and placing reliance on the same, held the accused
to be the author of the injuries contributing to the death of the
deceased.
10.          Section 25 of the Act speaks that no confession made
to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of
any offence, but Section 26 of the Act which is in the nature of an
exception to the rule provided in Section 25 allows a confession
made in the custody of a police officer to be proved, if the same is
made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. However, Section
27 of the Act which is in the nature of proviso to the aforesaid rule
provided in Sections 25 and 26 of the Act with regard to use of
confession before police, speaks that when a fact is deposed to as

                                       8
discovered in consequent of information received from a person
accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much
of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as
relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.
11.         The aforesaid mandate of law would go to show that
though use of confession under Section 25 of the Act before the
police officer is prohibited, if the same is made in the immediate
presence of a Magistrate, Section 26 of the Act allows such
confession made before the police to be admissible in evidence.
While Section 27 of the Act overrides the aforesaid prohibitions of
use of confession made in police custody by a person accused of
an offence, to be proved, even if not made in the circumstances as
indicated in Section 26 of the Act, if such confession appears to be
an information given to the police pursuant to which a fact was
discovered and such information albeit relevant information, if
distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered. Section 27 of the
Act does not make confession of an accused while in police
custody, to be admissible, which does not distinctly relate to the
fact discovered pursuant to such information. It allows such
information even if the same is a confession which distinctly
relates to the fact discovered.
12.         In the case of Pulukuri Kottaya and others –vrs.-
Emperor, reported in AIR (34) 1947 Privy Council 67, in the
context of Section 27 of the evidence Act have held as follows:
                   “It is fallacious to treat the “fact discovered”
            within the section as equivalent to the object
            produced. The fact discovered embraces the place
            from which the object is produced and the
            knowledge of the accused as to this, and the
            information given, must relate distinctly to this fact.
            Information as to past user, or the past history, of

                                     9
            the object produced is not related to its discovery in
            the setting in which it is discovered. Information
            supplied by a person in custody that         “I    will
            produce a knife concealed in the roof        of    my
            house” does not lead to the discovery of a knife;
            knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to
            the discovery of the fact that a knife is
            concealed in the house of the informant to his
            knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have
            been used in the commission of the offence, the
            fact discovered is very relevant. But if to the
            statement the words be added “with which I
            stabbed A” these words are inadmissible since
            they do not relate to the discovery of the knife
            in the house of the informant.” (emphasis
            supplied)
The aforesaid has been relied upon in a line of decisions by the
Apex Court as well as different High Courts of India till date. To
our knowledge, the Apex Court has not laid down any law contrary
to the aforesaid law laid down by the Privy Council in the case of
Pulukuri Kottaya (supra). The above proposition of law in this
regard which has been described as a “locus classicus”, set at rest
much of the controversy that centered round the interpretation of
Section 27 of the Act.
13.         The    Apex    Court    in    the    case    of    MOHMED
INAYATULLAH        –VRS.-    THE    STATE      OF     MAHARASHTRA,
reported in (1976) 1 SCC 828, interpreting Section 27 of the Act
have held as follows:
            “12. The expression “provided that” together with
           the phrase “whether it amounts to a confession or
           not” show that the section is in the nature of an
           exception to the preceding provisions particularly
           Sections 25 and 26. It is not necessary in this case
           to consider if this section qualifies, to any extent,
           Section24, also.    It will be seen that the first
           condition necessary for bringing this section into
           operation is the discovery of a fact, albeit a relevant
           fact, in consequence of the information received from

                                       10
            a person accused of an offence. The second is that
            the discovery of such fact must be deposed to. The
            third is that at the time of the receipt of the
            information the accused must be in                police
            custody. The last but the most important condition
            is that only “so much of the information” as relates
            distinctly to the fact thereby discovered is
            admissible. The rest of the information has to be
            excluded. The word “distinctly” means “directly”,
            “indubitably”, “strictly”, “unmistakably”. The word
            has been advisedly used to limit and define the
            scope of the provable information. The phrase
            “distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered” is
            the linchpin of the provision. This phrase refers to
            that part of the information supplied by the accused
            which is the direct and immediate cause of the
            discovery. The reason behind this partial lifting of
            the ban against confessions and statements made to
            the police, is that if a fact is actually discovered in
            consequence of information given by the accused, it
            affords some guarantee of truth of that part, and
            that part only, of the information which was the
            clear, immediate and proximate cause of the
            discovery. No such guarantee or assurance attaches
            to the rest of the statement which may be indirectly
            or remotely related to the fact discovered.”
14.         So also in the case of STATE OF MAHARASHTRA –
VRS.- DAMU S/O GOPINATH SHINDE AND OTHERS, reported in
(2000) 6 SCC 269, placing reliance in the case of Pulukuri
Kottaya (supra) at paragraphs 35 and 36, the Apex Court have
held as follows:
                   “35 The basic idea embedded in Section 27 of
            the Evidence Act is the doctrine of confirmation by
            subsequent events. The doctrine is founded on the
            principle that if any fact is discovered in a search
            made on the strength of any information obtained
            from a prisoner, such a discovery is a guarantee that
            the information supplied by the prisoner is true.
            The information might be confessional or non-
            inculpatory in nature, but if it results in discovery of
            a fact it becomes a reliable information. Hence the
            legislature permitted such information to be used as

                                      11
            evidence by restricting the admissible portion to the
            minimum. It is now well settled that recovery of an
            object is not discovery of a fact as envisaged in the
            section. The decision of the Privy Council         in
            Pulukuri Kottaya v. Emperor is the most quoted
            authority for supporting the interpretation that the
            “fact discovered” envisaged in the section embraces
            the place from which the object was produced, the
            knowledge of the accused as to it, but the
            information given must relate distinctly to that
            effect.
                    36. No doubt, the information permitted to be
            admitted in evidence is confined to that portion of
            the information which “distinctly relates to the fact
            thereby discovered”. But the information to get
            admissibility need not be so truncated as to make it
            insensible or incomprehensible. The extent of
            information admitted should be consistent with
            understandability. Xx xx xx xx xx”
15.         The evidence of the investigating officer would go to
show that the accused said to have given information of
concealment of the stone (M.O.IV) and the lathi (M.O.V) in a place
which are found to be weapons of offence inasmuch as the doctor
(P.W.8) in his evidence examined the aforesaid and answered the
query of the I.O. vide Ext.10 that the aforesaid could have caused
the injuries on the deceased and he identified the said M.Os.IV
and V, so also human blood was found in the lathi (M.O.V) in the
chemical examination, as revealed from chemical examination
report (Ext.15). The information of the accused to have caused the
death of the deceased causing the injuries contributing to the
death of the deceased with the stone (M.O.IV) and the lathi (M.O.V)
is a confession, but the same does not distinctly relate to the fact
discovered i.e. recovery of concealed stone (M.O.IV) and lathi
(M.O.V) in a place within the knowledge of the accused inasmuch
as the said discovery of fact does not in any manner relates to user

                                       12
of the aforesaid M.Os. Without information of the fact that he used
the    same     in   causing     the    injuries contributing     to the
death    of  the   deceased,    the   facts   as aforesaid could have
been discovered also. But, learned Sessions Judge held the same
to be admissible under Section 27 of the Act in spite of prohibition
contained in Sections 25 and 26 of the Act and placing reliance on
the same, held the accused to be the author of the crime. Such
approach of the learned Sessions Judge is contrary to law laid
down in the case of Pulukuri Kottaya (supra), reiterated in a
number of decisions by the Apex Court including in the cases of
MOHMED INAYATULLAH (supra) and DAMU S/O GOPINATH
SHINDE AND OTHERS (supra)
16.         Besides the same, no other evidence being there, now it
is to be seen whether the aforesaid circumstances, i.e., the
deceased died a homicidal death and pursuant to the information
given by the accused M.Os.IV and V, the weapons of offence, were
recovered from the place of concealment, are sufficient enough to
hold the accused to be the author of the crime. The Apex Court in
the case of Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and another –vrs.-
State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in AIR 1952 SC 343, dealing
with a case of circumstantial evidence have held as follows:
            “In dealing with circumstantial evidence the rules
            specially applicable to such evidence must be borne
            in mind. In such cases there is always the danger
            that conjecture or suspicion may take the place of
            legal proof. In cases where the evidence is of a
            circumstantial nature, the circumstances from
            which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should
            in the first instance be fully established, and all the
            facts so established should be consistent only with
            the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again,
            the circumstances should be of conclusive nature
            and tendency and they should be such as to exclude

                                     13
           every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.
           In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so
           far complete as not to leave any            reasonable
           ground for a conclusion consistent with             the
           innocence of the accused and it must be such as to
           show that within all human probability the act must
           have been done by the accused.” (quoted from
           placitum)
The aforesaid law laid down by the Apex Court has been reiterated
in a number of decisions by the Apex Court including in the oft
quoted decision with regard to recording of conviction on
circumstantial evidence i.e. the case of Sharad Birdhichand
Sarda –vrs. State of Maharashtra: reported in AIR 1984 SC 1622.
The Apex Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra)
have held as follows:
           “The following conditions must be fulfilled before a
           case against an accused based on circumstantial
           evidence can be said to be fully established;
               (1) The     circumstances     from    which     the
                   conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
                   fully established.        The circumstances
                   concerned ‘must or should’ and not ‘may be’
                   established;
               (2) The facts so established should be consistent
                   only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the
                   accused, that is to say, they should not be
                   explainable on any other hypothesis except
                   that the accused is guilty;
               (3) The circumstances should be of a conclusive
                   nature and tendency;
               (4) They     should    exclude    every    possible
                   hypothesis except the one to be proved; and
               (5) There must be a chain of evidence to
                   complete as not to leave any reasonable
                   ground for the conclusion consistent with the
                   innocence of the accused and must show
                   that in all human probability the act must
                   have been done by the accused.” (quoted
                   from placitum)

                                        14
17.         Learned counsel for the accused has argued that        a
piece of evidence collected under Section 27 of the Act in no
circumstances can form the foundation of the conviction and as
such the accused is entitled to an order of acquittal. The aforesaid
is a favorite argument advanced at the Bar in most of the cases,
where only the incriminating evidence is relevant under Section 27
of the Act. But the aforesaid contention is at times fallacious as
seen from the law laid down in the case of Pulukuri Kottaya
(supra) of the Privy Council. A Division Bench of this Court dealing
with the aforesaid in the case of Satrughana alias Satura Majhi –
vrs.- State, reported in XXXV (1969) CLT 351, have held at
paragraph 8 as follows:
                  “8. Kottaya v. Emperor, is the leading decision
            on this point. A clear exposition of the evidentiary
            value of such a statement is given in para 11 of the
            judgment. Their Lordships observed thus:-
                  “Except in cases in which the possession, or
                  concealment, of an object constitutes the gist
                  of the offence charged, it can seldom happen
                  that information relating to the discovery of a
                  fact forms the foundation of the prosecution
                  case. It is only one link in the chain of proof,
                  and the other links must be forged in manner
                  allowed by law.”
            The effect of this passage has unfortunately been
            overlooked in most of the subsequent decisions.
                  The implication of this concept may be
            explained by an illustration. If the statement made
            under Section 27 of the Evidence Act leads to
            discovery of opium, then a conviction can be
            founded solely on the basis of that statement, as
            possession of opium without license is by itself an
            offence under the Opium Act. Similarly discovery of
            arms without licence on the basis of a statement
            made under Section 27 of the Evidence Act can
            constitute the sole basis of conviction. But where
            the gist of the offence is not possession alone, then

                                        15
            the statement leading to discovery in most cases
            cannot constitute the foundation of the prosecution
            case. As their Lordships put it, it is only one link
            in the chain of proof, and the other links must
            be established beyond reasonable doubt before the
            guilt is brought home to the accused.”
However, in the present case, the aforesaid circumstances does
not satisfy the requirement to record the conviction as laid down
in the case of Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and another
(supra) and also in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra).
This Court also in the case of Satrughana alias Satura Majhi
(supra) in similar circumstances had held as follows:
                   “9. A direct case on the point is to be found in
            Dhunda v. Emperor. In that case, a blood stained
            chopper and a blood stained chadar were recovered
            from the house of the accused. Their Lordships held
            that such a discovery was not by itself enough to
            justify the conviction. They observed thus:-
                          “This is circumstantial evidence the
                   value of which is very great when used to
                   corroborate other evidence. It cannot by itself
                   prove the case for the Crown. It is possible to
                   imagine many an occasion where the mere
                   discovery of a blood-stained weapon or blood-
                   stained clothes was due to something other
                   than murder, for instance, concealing a dead
                   body or receiving from the real murderer a
                   blood-stained weapon in order to hide it and
                   so assist the murderer. It is impossible to say
                   that the discovery of a blood-stained article is
                   enough by itself to justify a conviction for
                   murder”.
                   A similar view was taken in In re Periyaswami
            Thevan. There the distinction in the effect of
            discovery of an article belonging to the deceased and
            to the accused was forcefully brought out. Their
            Lordships held that if the prosecution had shown
            that the blood-stains on the chopper belonged to the
            same group as the blood of the deceased, the answer
            would have been clinching. They observed thus:

                                          16
                          “Ordinarily in a case of circumstantial
                   evidence where there has been a discovery as
                   a result of confession made under Section 27,
                   Evidence Act, one expects to find            the
                   discovery of something which can              be
                   associated with the deceased and not with the
                   accused. The question of the weapon with
                   which the offence was committed being
                   discovered as a result of information given by
                   the accused is also probable. But in such a
                   case the mere fact that a weapon, which could
                   have been used for the commission of a crime
                   like this, was discovered with blood-stains on
                   it on information given by the accused, would
                   not, by itself be sufficient to show that he was
                   the murderer”.
            On the dictum of the Privy Council authority, we are
            clearly of opinion that the confessional statement
            leading to discovery, in the facts and circumstances
            of this case, cannot establish the prosecution case
            that the accused was the murderer, though it raises
            grave suspicion.”
18.         On reappraisal of the evidence on record, therefore, we
are of the considered opinion that in this case conviction recorded
by the learned Sessions Judge, Koraput against the accused is
indefensible inasmuch as the circumstances which has been
brought to the record in this case does not satisfy the test to
record a conviction as held by the Apex Court in the cases of
Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and another (supra) and Sharad
Birdhichand Sarda (supra). Hence, there being no evidence
indicating that the accused to be the author of the homicidal
death of the deceased, we have no hesitation to say that judgment
of conviction and order of sentence have been passed in this case
in erroneous appreciation of evidence on record and as such the
same are liable to be set aside and this Jail Criminal Appeal
deserves to be allowed.

                                             17
     19.           Accordingly, this Jail Criminal Appeal stands allowed.
     Consequently, the judgment of conviction and order of sentence
     passed against the accused are set aside and          the    accused
     stands acquitted of the charge under Section 302 of the I.P.C. The
     accused be set at liberty forthwith, if he is not otherwise required
     to be incarcerated.
