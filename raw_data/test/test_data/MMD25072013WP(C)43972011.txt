                               W.P.(C) No. 4397 of 2011
5. 25.07.2013             Heard     Mr.    Biswamohan      Pattnaik,  learned
              Senior Advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Sailelsh
              Chandra Samantaray for the opposite parties.
                          The petitioner calls in question the legality and
              propriety of the order of removal from service by the
              opposite parties.
                          The case of the petitioner, sans details, is that
              he was working as Badli Worker in the Branch Office of
              L.I.C. of India at Bhawanipatna. While the petitioner was
              continuing as such, the matter was referred to the National
              Industrial   Tribunal    for   regularization of his service.
              Pursuant to the decision dated 17.4.1986, the opposite
              parties decided to give regular appointment to the part
              time workers, who had worked at least 70 days during the
              period from 1.1.1982 to 25.5.1985. Thereafter he filed an
              application   before     opposite   party   no.1   for  regular
              appointment in class-IV post. It is stated that he was
              selected in the test examination held on 30.7.1989 and on
              the basis of such test appointment order was issued on
              28.8.1989 appointing him as Sub-staff (Class-IV). It is
              further stated that he was prosecuting his studies in
              Radha Krishna High School, Santpur in the district of
              Kalahandi.    He    left   the   school   on   2.8.1984   while
              prosecuting studies in class-X. Thereafter he obtained his
              transfer certificate. At the time of making application he
              had submitted the transfer certificate issued from Radha
              Krishna High School. While matter stood thus, a notice
              was issued on 18.4.1990 by the Branch Manager, L.I.C. of

                      2
India, Bhawanipatna, asking him to submit his reply. It is
stated therein that the Divisional Office in their letter dated
6.3.1990 had advised the petitioner to submit his reply
within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the said
letter.  On    8.5.1990    the   petitioner   submitted      his
explanation stating therein that he had never submitted
any certificate from Krupasindhu High School, Charbahal,
but had submitted his School Leaving Certificate No. 44/2
dated 2.2.1985 from Radha Krishna High School, Santpur,
wherein he studied up to Class-X. Being not satisfied with
the explanation submitted by the petitioner, opposite party
no.1 issued a charge sheet-cum- show cause on 15.5.1990
as per Regulation 39(1) of the L.I.C. of India (Staff)
Regulation,    1960   (here-in-after   referred  to    as   ‘the
Regulation’). On a conspectus of the charge sheet, it is
evident that the petitioner submitted an application on
22.7.1989 for the post of Sub-staff enclosing therein the
Xerox copy of the transfer certificate No. 47 dated 7.7.1989
from Krupasindhu High School, Charbahal in support of
his qualification and date of birth. At the time of interview
he had also produced the original certificate and the same
was compared with the Xerox copy. On verification, it was
found that the transfer certificate was not genuine and was
false. By producing such false certificate, the petitioner
fraudulently gave wrong information about his age and
qualification     and thereby misleading the Corporation
obtained appointment. The charges were framed on two
counts namely, the petitioner failed to maintain absolute
integrity and that he acted in a manner prejudicial to good
conduct and detrimental to the interest of the Corporation

                        3
and    thus    violated   Regulation(21)   and  39(1)  of  the
Regulation. In reply to the same, he submitted show cause
denying the charges leveled against him. In reply a simple
ground was taken that he had never submitted any
certificate of Krupasinghdu High School, Charbahal, rather
he   had    submitted     transfer  certificateNo.44/2   dated
2.2.1985 of Radha Krishna High School, Santpur. By order
dated 10.7.1990 an Enquiry Officer was appointed to
conduct an inquiry into the charges framed against the
petitioner since the explanation submitted by the petitioner
was found not satisfactory. The Enquiry Officer after
affording opportunity of hearing to the petitioner submitted
the enquiry report on 5.12.1991 stating therein that the
petitioner had submitted Xerox copy of the Transfer
certificate of Krupasindhu High School, Charbahal along
with his application for the post of Sub-staff. While the
matter stood thus, on 27.6.1992 a second show cause
notice was issued to the petitioner by the Senior Divisional
Manager (Disciplinary Authority). After considering the
aforesaid enquiry report as well as show cause reply, the
Senior Divisional Manager (Disciplinary Authority) in his
order dated 25.9.1992 imposed the penalty of reduction of
two steps in the time scale in terms of Regulation 39(1)(d)
of the Regulation. But the Zonal Manager, who was the
Reviewing Authority reviewed the order passed by the
Disciplinary Authority on 24.3.1993 and held that the
punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority does not
commensurate with the gravity of misconduct on the part
of the petitioner. Thereafter he issued show cause notice to
the petitioner asking him to show cause as to why the

                      4
penalty of removal from service shall not be imposed on
him. The petitioner submitted a detailed show cause reply
on 17.5.1993 before the Zonal Manager. The Zonal
Manager by its order dated 28.9.1993 removed the
petitioner from service. The Memorial made by the
petitioner before the Chairman, LIC of India was also
rejected by order dated 18.6.1994(Annexure-16).
             Pursuant to issuance of notice, opposite parties
entered appearance and filed a counter affidavit. A
preliminary objection is taken that the writ petition is filed
after a lapse of 17 years and as such the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed. It is further stated that the
petitioner had submitted the Xerox copy of the transfer
certificate issued by Krupasindhu High School, Charbahal
along with his application for recruitment to the post of
Sub staff in support of his age and qualification. But the
same was found to be a fabricated one and thereafter a
disciplinary proceeding was initiated. The Disciplinary
Authority after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing
to the petitioner, imposed penalty of reduction of 2 steps in
the time scale in terms of Regulation 39(1)(d) of Regulation.
But then the Reviewing Authority not being satisfied with
the order of punishment passed by the Disciplinary
Authority, issued show cause notice to the petitioner for
enhancement of the punishment. After considering the
explanation submitted by the petitioner and taking a
holistic view of the matter, the Zonal Manager, who was
the Reviewing Authority, removed the petitioner from the
services.
             On   perusal  of  paragraph-18    of   the   writ

                      5
application, we are satisfied that the petitioner was
prevented by sufficient cause in approaching this Court.
He was suffering from various diseases. Further more his
only son was attacked by sickle cell disease since June,
2002 and was being treated in different hospitals. While
matter stood thus, his son died on 16.1.2009. The
petitioner belongs to lower rung of the society. Under such
circumstances, it is not expected from a person like the
petitioner to approach the Court with utmost promptitude.
            In paragraph-15 of the writ application it is
further stated that several other persons, who were
indulged in such type of misconduct, faced disciplinary
proceedings. Two of such persons are Ramanath Lakra and
Stephen Khalko. In the disciplinary proceeding initiated
against Ramanath Lakra , punishment of reduction of pay
by one stage permanently was awarded against him. So far
as Stephen Khalko is concerned, the basic pay was
reduced by two stages. According to the petitioner, he is
similarly circumstanced with that of Ramanath Lakra and
Stephen Khalko in as much as the charges leveled against
them are almost identical.
            Learned counsel appearing for the opposite
parties submits that since the charges framed against the
petitioner are serious, the Zonal Manager, who was
reviewing authority, was quite justified in removing the
petitioner from service and the punishment awarded
against the petitioner commensurate to the gravity of the
charges.
            We are at a loss to understand the submission
made by the opposite parties. The L.I.C. of India is a

                      6
Government of India Undertaking. It is expected of an ideal
employer to treat its employees equally, who are on similar
footing. Treating the employees according to its whim or
caprice is least expected from an ideal employer. Two
employees, who were facing charges identical to that of the
petitioner, were awarded lesser punishment. Thus, there is
no rhyme or reason as to why the petitioner would be
awarded a severe punishment like removal from service.
            In  Akhilesh    Kumar    Singh    v.   State   of
Jharkhand and others, 2007(8) Supreme 713, the Hon’ble
apex Court held that delinquent officers similarly situated
should be dealt with similarly provided the charges leveled
against the employees are identical and it is desirable that
they should be dealt with similarly. The ratio of the case in
Akhilesh Kumar Singh applies with full force to the facts
of the present case.
            In view of the analysis made above, we are of
the opinion that the petitioner should have been similarly
dealt with as has been done by the management in the
cases of Ramanath Lakra and Stephen Kalko. We set aside
the order of removal from service of the petitioner vide
Annexure-13 and the order of the Chairman, LIC of India
vide Annexure-16. We direct the opposite parties to
consider the question of awarding such other punishment
against the petitioner as would deem fit and proper. We
make it clear that the petitioner shall not be entitled to
back wages for the period he was out of service. The Zonal
Manager (Reviewing Authority) shall take a decision within
a period of three months from the date communication of
this order.

                         7
               The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
               Urgent certified copy of this order be granted as
    per rules.
