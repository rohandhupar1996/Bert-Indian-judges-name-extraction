               for some period. Learned counsel for the petitioner further
               submits that the petitioner is willing to deposit the tax, but the
               penalty amount being excessive, the same may be reduced.
                              Considering the submissions made, it is directed

               petitioner has not incurred any other dues in the meantime and
               the vehicle is otherwise fit to ply on the road. It is further
               observed that such permit and fitness certificate may be
               cancelled by the opposite party in the event of default in
               payment of the aforesaid instalments of penalty amount by the
               dates stipulated above or default in payment of any other dues
               accrued against the petitioner. In that event, the petitioner shall
               be able to pay the whole of the amount of penalty imposed. If
               the 60% of the penalty amount is paid by the dates stipulated,
