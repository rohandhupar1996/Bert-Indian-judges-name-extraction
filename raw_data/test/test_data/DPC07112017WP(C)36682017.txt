                                           AND

                           Date of judgment:07.11.2017
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. D.P.Choudhury, J.          In this writ petition, challenge has been made to
     the letter of the District Judge, Deogarh dated 01.11.2016 (Annexure-9)
     with further prayer to direct the opposite parties to allow the petitioner
     to join the Judgeship of Sambalpur.
     2.           FACTS
                  The infiltrated factual matrix leading to the case of the writ
     petition is that the petitioner was appointed as a Junior Stenographer in
     the undivided judgeship of Sambalpur on 10.04.1995. While continuing
     as such, as in the year 2010 there was a proposal for creation of new
     judgeship of Deogarh, learned District Judge, Sambalpur, opposite party

                                    -2-
no.3 invited options from the Class-III and Class-IV employees of
Sambalpur judgeship for being deployed to the newly created Deogarh
judgeship and to work in the judgeship of Samblapur. The petitioner
gave his option to work in the judgeship of Sambalpur. Without taking
into consideration the option given by the petitioner, opposite party no.3
posted the petitioner as Senior Stenographer in the Court of the learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Deogarh, but one Sri Jagatram Pradhan, who
was working as a Senior Stenographer was allowed to continue in the
judgeship of Deogarh as per his option.
3.          Be it stated that, as per the G.A. Department Office
Memorandum dated 13.12.1996 (Annexure-3), in case of creation of a
new judgeship, the posts shall be filled up from the bottom of the cadre
in the undivided judgeship by applying the “bottom-up” principle and
since one Bijay Kumar Bhumij was junior to the petitioner, he should
have been transferred to Deogarh judgeship as a matter of princple. The
native place of the petitioner is at Sambalpur and his family members
are residing there for which it is convenient for him to work in the
judgeship of Sambalpur. On 24.04.2013, the petitioner made a
representation to the opposite party no.3 and since the same was not
considered, he approached this Court by filing W.P.(C) No.12645 of
2013, which was disposed of on 14.09.2016 directing the opposite party
no.3 to dispose of the representation of the petitioner dated 24.04.2013
expeditiously.
4.          It is stated that after the order was passed in W.P.(C)
No.12645 of 2013, the opposite party no.3 allowed the representation of
the petitioner for his transfer to Sambalpur judgeship, but the opposite

                                    -3-
party no.3 also asked the learned District Judge, Deogarh, opposite
party no.4 as to whether the petitioner could be spared and vide letter
dated 01.11.2016, opposite party no.4 refused to spare the petitioner.
Since the order of this Court and the Office Memorandum of G.A.
Department vide Annexure-3, as stated above, have not been followed,
the petitioner filed the instant writ petition to quash the letter dated
01.11.2016 (Annexure-9) of opposite party no.4 and allow the petitioner
to join in the judgeship of Sambalpur.
5.           Mr.Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
the petitioner was working in the judgeship of Sambalpur diligently
when option was called for to find out whether the petitioner would be
deployed to Deogarh, which is against the “bottom-up” principle. Rule-
13 of the Orissa District and Sub-ordinate Courts’ Non-Judicial Staff
Services (Method of Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2008
(hereinafter called “the Rules, 2008”), providing for inter-judgeship
transfer, is not applicable in this case, but the opposite parties have
construed the same as applicable which is not legal and proper. Since
this Court, in the earlier writ petition of the petitioner, has asked the
opposite party no.3 to carry out the instructions which was incumbent
on the opposite party no.3, while allowing the representation of the
petitioner as per the order of this Court, opposite party no.3 should not
have asked the opposite party no.4 as to whether the petitioner’s
service can be spared or not. He further submitted that after the order
of this Court was passed to consider the representation of the petitioner
and the same has been duly considered, the order of the opposite party
no.4 refusing to spare the petitioner is not only against the order of this

                                    -4-
Court but also against the instruction of the State Government. So, he
contended to quash the letter of opposite party no.4 in Annexure-9 and
further allow the petitioner to be redeployed to the judgeship of
Sambalpur.
6.           Mr.Tripathy,  learned    Additional  Government     Advocate
submitted that the writ petition is not maintainable and it is the
prerogative of the authority to spare his employee because the
administration of justice is the paramount consideration for every
judicial establishment. He further submitted that there is shortage of
stenographers in the judgeship of Deogarh for which the opposite party
no.4 has rightly refused to spare the petitioner. According to him, this is
an inter-judgeship transfer where the consent of employer is essential,
although it is prerogative for all the employees including the officers to
exercise the option subject to the approval by the administrative
authority. When for the larger public interest, the petitioner has been
appointed as stenographer in the judgeship of Deogarh, there is no
defect in the impugned order under Annexure-9 to spare the petitioner
for going back to Sambalpur Judgeship. As such, the writ petition is
misconceived and the same should be dismissed.
7.           POINT FOR DETERMINATION
             The main point for determination is as to whether the
petitioner is entitled to be deployed/returned to the judgeship of
Sambalpur?
8.           DISCUSSIONS
             It is admitted fact that the petitioner was appointed as a
Junior Stenographer in the erstwhile undivided judgeship of Sambalpur

                                     -5-
in 1995 and subsequently, he was promoted to the post of Senior
Stenographer. It is not in dispute that the petitioner has exercised his
option to be retained in the parent judgeship of Sambalpur, but was
transferred to Deogarh.
9.          Annexure-1 series show that on 4.2.2013, the petitioner
conveyed his willingness to work in the mother judgeship of Sambalpur.
Annexure-2 is the extract of the order of opposite party no.3 from which
it appears that the name of the petitioner finds places at Serial No.39
whereas the name of one Jagatram Pradhan finds place at Serial No.38.
So, it is not in doubt that the petitioner is junior to Sri Jagatram
Pradhan. The Office Memorandum of the General Administration
Department dated 13.12.1996 (Annexure-3) stipulates guidelines for re-
deployment of surplus staff of mother district to the newly created
districts on re-organization of the district. On going through the said
Office Memorandum, it appears that Clause-2.1 provides action for re-
deployment of employees borne in the cadres of mother district shall be
taken by the respective district cadre controlling authorities of the
mother district. It is also clear from the said Office Memorandum that as
far as practicable and subject to vacancies in the relevant grades, the
assignment of the employees to the cadre of the mother district or the
cadres of the newly created districts may be made on the basis of the
position in the gradation list of the original district cadre taking into
account their preferences. In fact in the counter affidavit filed on behalf
of the opposite party no.4, it is clearly admitted that after the
willingness of the employees are collected, the principle of “bottom-up”
theory, i.e, two stenographers of the composite judgeship were only

                                       -6-
transferred to the judgeship of Deogarh, which is challenged seriously
by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The opposite party no.3 does
not deny about placing the petitioner above one B.K.Bhumij. If the
“bottom-up” principle is applied, it is for the Bhumij to be retained in
Deogarh. However, it is stated by the petitioner that he had made
representation which was pending and as it was not disposed of, he filed
W.P.(C) No.12645 of 2013, which was disposed of on 14.09.2016 with
the following order:
                              “W.P.(C) No.12645 of 2013
            05.   14.09.2016
                   Heard learned counsel for        the petitioner and
            learned counsel for the State.
                   This writ petition has been filed praying for a
            direction to the opposite parties to consider the option
            exercised by the petitioner for transferring and posting
            him in the judgeship of Sambalpur within a stipulated
            period.
                   It is stated that a representation in this regard has
            been submitted to the District Judge, Sambalpur-opposite
            party no.3, dated 24.04.2013, as per Annexure-7 to the
            writ petition, which according to the petitioner is still
            pending consideration. Accordingly, a prayer has been
            made to direct the said opposite party no.3 to consider
            and dispose of petitioner’s representation expeditiously.
                   Considering the limited nature of grievances and
            without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case,
            this writ petition is disposed of directing the District
            Judge, Sambalpur-opposite party no.3, to dispose of the
            representation of the petitioner dated 24.04.2013
            (Annexure-7), if the same is still pending, as expeditiously
            as possible, preferably within a period of three months
            from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
            Xx     xx      xx    xx”
10.         Annexure-8 shows that in pursuance of the aforesaid order,
opposite party no.3 has allowed the representation of the petitioner on
28.10.2016 for his transfer from Deogarh judgeship to Sambalpur

                                     -7-
judgeship. In Annexure-8, opposite party no.3 has sought for the
consent of opposite party no.4 whether the service of the petitioner can
be spared, even though order of this Court, in previous writ petition did
not direct to seek for the consent of opposite party no.4. That apart,
this is not a case of inter-judgeship transfer as per Rule-13 of the Rules,
2008, but it is a case of deployment. In the case of inter-judgeship
transfer, while one judgeship must be ready to spare an employee
subject to the consent of other judgeship to accept him and after the
consent of respective District Judges, the Court allows the transfer from
one judgeship to another judgeship. In the counter affidavit, opposite
party    no.3   in  one   hand   denied   the  applicability  of  the  Office
Memorandum of the G.A. Department, but on the other hand, it is
stated that the “bottom-up” principle made in Clause-2.6 has been
violated. Moreover, the opposite party no.3, in the counter affidavit,
denied to accept the request for transfer of the petitioner in view of the
fact that opposite party no.4 refused to spare the service of the
petitioner. Once the representation of the petitioner has been allowed in
pursuance of the order of this Court, the action of the opposite party
no.3 seeking opinion of opposite party no.4 for sparing the service of
the petitioner is quite in appropriable because the opposite party no.3
was only directed to dispose of the representation of the petitioner
because of the order of this Court passed in W.P.(C) No.12645 of 2013
either to allow or reject but not for passing any conditional order.
11.           Similarly, in the counter affidavit filed by the opposite party
no.4, a plea has been taken that due to paucity of staff, the service of
the petitioner is not spared and it took up the case as a case of inter-

                                     -8-
judgeship transfer, which is misconceived. After going through the
counter affidavit of opposite party no.3 and opposite party no.4, we are
of the view that opposite parties 3 and 4 have neither understood the
policy of deployment nor understood the policy of inter-judgeship
transfer. In such situation, since the petitioner has made option to be
retained in the judgeship of Sambalpur and Sri Bhumij is below him and
other   employees    have    been    also accommodated     in  Sambalpur
judgeship, the redeployment of petitioner in the judgeship of Deogarh
against his option and later on seeking permission of opposite party
no.4 to spare his service and refusal by opposite party no.4 are all de
hors the principle of deployment. No reason has been assigned in
Annexure-2 series as to why the petitioner’s case was not considered in
spite of his option. So, we are of the opinion that the petitioner’s
representation should have been disposed of in terms of his option
without seeking any permission from the judgeship of Deogarh. On the
other hand, the transfer of the petitioner to the judgeship of Sambalpur
should be made as a policy of deployment and the question of inter-
judgeship transfer does not arise. The point is answered accordingly.
12.          CONCLUSION
             In the writ petition, it has been prayed to quash the letter
dated 01.11.2016 vide Annexure-9 and to direct the opposite parties to
allow the petitioner to join in the judgeship of Sambalpur in view of the
fact that the representation of the petitioner for his transfer to
Sambalpur judgehip has been allowed by the opposite party no.3 vide
Annexure-8 in pursuance of the order of this Court.

                                   -9-
13.          In terms of our above discussion, it has already been
observed that the opposite party no.3 should not have asked for the
opinion of opposite party no.4 regarding sparing the service of the
petitioner while he has already allowed the petitioner to join in the
judgeship of Sambalpur in pursuance of order passed by this Court in
W.P(C) No.12645 of 2013. Also it has been observed hereinabove that
the plea of paucity of staff by the opposite party no.4 should not be a
ground not to spare the service of the petitioner when he has given
option to work in the judgeship of Sambalpur. Moreover, the letter of
opposite party no.4 dated 01.11.2016 only shows that since the
inception of the judgeship, they are facing a lot of hindrances due to
lack of Senior Stenographer for which the service of the petitioner could
not be spared. It must be borne in mind that as per the provisions of
Rules, 2008, each judgeship has to make recruitment each year and the
judgeships are created since 2013, inaction on the part of the opposite
party no.4 cannot stand on the way to defeat the policy of deployment
as propounded by this Court time and again while new judgeship are
being created bereft of the policy of the inter-judgeship transfer.
Therefore, the Court hastens to add that the plea of not sparing the
petitioner to the judgeship of Sambalpur cannot be said to be in public
exigencies. Hence, such letter vide Annexure-9 being de hors the law
and principles and policy of deployment, is liable to be quashed and the
Court do so. It is hereby directed to implement the order passed in
Annexure-8 without seeking for any permission from the opposite party
no.4 for sparing the service of the petitioner. On the other hand, the
Court direct learned District Judge, Deogarh, opposite party no.4 to

                                                   - 10 -
    relieve the petitioner forthwith and direct him to join in the judgeship of
    Sambalpur in the same capacity on the next day of his relief and
    opposite party no.3 would also issue order of posting immediately after
    joining of the petitioner in the office of District Judge, Sambalpur.
                           The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
