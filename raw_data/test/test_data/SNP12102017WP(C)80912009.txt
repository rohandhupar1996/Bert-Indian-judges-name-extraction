           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. N. Prasad, J.          This writ petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the
           Constitution of India wherein the following prayers have been made;
           i.      To hold and declare the impugned selection to the post of Divisional
           Accountant pursuant to third D.T. Examination conducted by CESU in
           April, 2008 as bad and illegal and thereby to quash the impugned illegal
           selection and appointment orders of the opposite parties 3 to 6 to the post

                                     2
of Divisional Accountant with a further direction to hold a fresh selection or
to consider the case of the petitioner in its right       prospective       by
allowing a fresh valuation of English Paper-I of the petitioner through an
expert in English.
ii.    direct/order/command the opposite parties 1 and 2 to allow
promotion to the petitioner to the post of Divisional Accountant with all
consequential service and monetary benefits.
2.            The grievance of the petitioner who appears in person is that
he has joined his service and while continuing as Clerk-B in the Corporate
Office of the opposite party no.1 and also putting more than 30 years of
unblemished service, having eligibility criteria for appearing in the
Departmental Test Examination in which he has appeared but has not
been considered suitable for promotion to the higher post while the
authorities have considered the candidature of the private opposite party
nos.3 to 5, who according to him were not eligible to be promoted as per the
rule of promotion. His further assertion is that one Ananta Ch. Debata, who
was also not eligible as per the rules of promotion, has been granted
promotion.
              The petitioner has raised his grievance by way of submitting
representations against his unsuitability to get promotion and against the
decision of the authorities granting promotion to the private opposite
parties as also Mr. Debata. He further submits that Mr. Debata has been

                                       3
found to be ineligible in a writ petition being W.P. (C) No.2728 of 2010 but
even    thereafter   he   has    been    granted promotion     to  the  higher
post.
3.           Per   contra,  Mr.   B.K.    Nayak   appearing   for  CESU    has
vehemently opposed the submission and arguments of the petitioner by
submitting that there is no illegality in the decision taken by the authorities
in allowing the private opposite parties in appearing in the 3rd D.T.
Examination. He submits that the petitioner has also participated in the 3rd
D.T. Examination but he has found failed, hence not found suitable and as
such not granted promotion to the higher post and when he has been
declared unsuccessful in the 3rd D.T. Examination, he has approached this
Court by way of the instant writ petition assailing the decision of the
Selection Board in granting promotion to the opposite parties 3 to 5.
             He further submits that so far as Mr. Debata is concerned,
although he on earlier occasion was allowed to appear in the 3 rd D.T.
Examination, but subsequently the competent body has found that he has
wrongly been allowed to appear in the 3rd D.T. Examination, hence his
candidature has been rejected, hence he has not allowed to grant
promotion to the higher post.
             He further submits that opposite parties 3 to 5 had been
appointed on contract basis and by way of giving relaxation to count the

                                     4
service rendered by them in the contractual period, they have been allowed
to participate in the examination. He submits that the relaxation has been
given to them in exercise of power conferred upon the authorities under
Regulation 17 of the Orissa State Electricity Board Subordinate, Audit and
Accounts Service Regulations, 1970. Copy of the Regulation has been
brought on record by way of affidavit filed on 10.10.2017 by serving a copy
of the same upon the learned counsel for the petitioner as per direction of
this Court dated 17.08.2017. On the strength of this submission and
argument, he submits that the writ petition is misconceived and as such
the same is fit to be dismissed.
             Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents available on record.
4.           This Court has heard the petitioner in person in detail by
affording sufficient time to him to place each and every document and by
putting reliance upon the documents, the petitioner has tried to make out a
case of illegal selection and some of the employees working under the
opposite party no.1 and also not granting promotion to him.
             His main ground is that opposite parties 3 to 5 are not eligible
as per the requirement of rule as contained in the office order dated
22.08.2007 under Annexure-1, which stipulates the decision taken by the
Committee of the Management Board in its meeting held on 10.07.2007

                                            5
    vide Agenda Item No.9 thereof, the existing eligibility criteria for the
    employees of CESU for appearing at the D.T. Examination is revised as
    under:-
    1. “The following categories of employees of CESU who have passed
        Matriculation/HSC or its equivalent examination and have not exhausted
        all the chances available to them are eligible to appear at the D.T.
        Examination.
        (a) Members of Subordinate Audit and Accounts Cadre in the grade of
            Junior Accountant with a minimum one year service or on completion
            of 25 years total service
            ‘Or’
            Divisional Head Clerk/Circle UDC and 1st Asst. after completion of 2
            years continuous service or on completion of total 25 years of service
            ‘Or’
             Clerk-B, Clerk-A on completion of 25 years of service and drawing pay
            scale identical to Head Clerk/Circle UDC on completion of 15 years or
            25 years in a post/grade as the case may be.
(b)         The above eligibility criteria shall be subject to the condition that the
            above mentioned categories of employees should be having not less
            than 3 years left-out service before retirement.”
                   According to the petitioner, opposite parties 3 to 5 have not
    completed the required tenure of service as stipulated i.e. on completion of
    25 years of service and the authorities have taken into consideration the
    service rendered by them while they were discharging their duties by way of
    contractual appointment and as such they are not even eligible to be
    allowed to participate in the 3rd D.T. Examination.
    5.             In response, learned counsel for the opposite party no.1 has
    submitted that there is no dispute about the fact that opposite parties 3 to
    5 have initially been appointed on contract. The authorities in order to
    adopt fair and transparent recruitment/promotion has followed the

                                        6
provision of regulation namely OSEB Subordinate, Audit, Accounts Service
Regulation, 1970 ( in short OSEB Service Regulations, 1970), wherein
there is a regulation conferring power upon the competent authority to
relax the condition of eligibility and in exercise of the said power, the
eligibility criteria has been relaxed by allowing to count their services while
they have rendered their services by way of contractual appointment and by
that they have been made eligible to be considered for participation in the
3rd D.T. Examination.
6.              On appreciation of the rival submission of the parties and after
going through the provision of the OSEB Service Regulations, 1970 which
has been incorporated in exercise of the power conferred by Clause-C of
Section 9 (a) of Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, wherein there is a regulation
as contained in Regulation 17, which speaks the power of relaxation of
regulations as referred hereunder as:-
           “Where the Board are satisfied that operation of any of the
           provisions of these regulations causes undue hardship in
           any particular case, the Board may dispense with or relax
           the requirements of the said provisions in order to deal with
           the case in a just and equitable manner.”
                When the Board is satisfied that operation of any of the
provision of the regulation causes undue hardship in any particular case,
the Board may dispense of with or relax the requirements of the said
provision in order to deal with the case in a just and equitable manner.

                                      7
              It is evident from the provision of the Regulation 17 that the
Board has got power to relax the requirement of the provision in order to
deal with the case in a just and equitable manner.
7.            The petitioner is putting reliance upon the office order dated
22.08.2007, which is the decision taken by the Managing Board in its
meeting held on 10.07.2007 vide Agenda Item No.9, wherein certain
eligibility conditions has been provided for appearing in the D.T.
Examination, but this office order does not speak anything with respect to
the regulation,1970. The regulation, 1970 will be said to be in continuation
even on the date of issuance of the office order dated 22.08.2007 having its
statutory and regulatory force and the office order dated 22.08.2007 will be
treated a supplement to the regulation, 1970, meaning thereby, the power
of relaxation which has been vested upon the Board under Regulation,
1970 is there even on the date of issuance of office order i..e. 22.08.2007
since nothing has been brought on record that the power of regulation,
provided under the Regulation, 1970 has been superseded by any other
statute or regulation.
8.            The authorities while exercising the power conferred under
Regulation 17 has granted relaxation in the meeting held on 16.11.2007 by
taking a decision regarding 16 numbers of junior accountants who have
been appointed on probation on successful completion of 2 years of
contract    period   vide  office order  No.32926   dated  19.09.2007   and

                                         8
continuing in different units to appear at the 3rd D.T. Examination in
relaxation of the eligibility criteria on a special consideration.
9.            Opposite parties 3 to 5 in the light of the said relaxation as has
been granted vide order dated 18.12.2007 which was in exercise of power
conferred upon the Board, in the light of the provision of Regulation 17 had
participated in the 3rd D.T. Examination in which they have qualified and
found suitable to grant promotion to the higher post and accordingly they
have been granted promotion.
10.           The petitioner has challenged their promotion by submitting
that they are not eligible, this submission of the petitioner is based upon
one line contained in the letter dated 18.12.2007 which is “such relaxation
shall not put any obligation on CESU to provide other facilities to the above
Junior Accountants”.
              By referring to this line, it has been submitted by the
petitioner that the content of this line is debar them from appearing in the
examinations, but this contention is totally misconceived for the reason
that this line only suggest that in view of the relaxation having been
granted these Junior Accountants will not claim any other facilities by
virtue of the said relaxation and further this line cannot be read out
segregating the other lines contained in the order dated 18.12.2007 which
is very explicit and express, wherein the Management Board in its meeting

                                      9
held on 16.11.2007 has taken decision to relax the conditions of such
junior accountants who have been appointed on probation on successful
completion of 2 years contract period and continuing in different units to
appear in the 3rd D.T. Examination in relaxation of eligibility criteria on a
special   consideration,    meaning  thereby   the   eligibility conditions  of
rendering particular period of service, has been relaxed. Moreover, the
order dated 18.12.2007 has never been questioned by the petitioner.
11.           In view of such a discussion having been made herein above,
this Court is of the considered view that the decision taken by the Selection
Board by granting relaxation in the eligibility conditions is well within their
jurisdiction in the light of the provision contained in the regulations 17 of
the Regulation, 1970 and on their participation in the 3rd D.T. Examination
has found to be suitable and thereby have been granted promotion, hence
there is no illegality in the same.
12.           So far as the contention of the petitioner that, Mr. Debata has
also been granted permission who is not eligible to be considered for
promotion being held suitable the order passed by this Court in W.P.(C)
No.2728 of 2010, but by going through the counter affidavit and
considering the arguments on behalf of the parties, this Court has found
that Mr. Debata although has been allowed to participate in the 3 rd D.T.
Examination but subsequently         it was found       that it was     due  to
misconception and wrong decision, it was rectified and subsequently his

                                         10
candidature has been rejected and in consequence thereof, he has not been
considered for promotion to the higher post by not allowing him to appear
in the 3rd D.T. Examination.
13.           It is further evident from the pleading made by the parties that
the petitioner has also been granted chance for consideration of his
candidature in which he has been found to be failed in Paper-I English in
which he has secured 52 marks, while the qualifying marks is 60 as per the
details furnished by the opposite parties in the counter affidavit. For better
appreciation, the same is being quoted herein below:-
  “The 3rd D.T. Examination was scheduled to be conducted from 8.4.2008 to
10.04.2008. Call letters were issued to 108 candidates, which includes the
petitioner and the opposite parties 3, 4, 5 and 6. The examination was
conducted smoothly and successfully without any problem on the following
papers.
Paper             Subject           Maximum      Minimum        Minimum
                                    marks        marks required marks required
                                                 for pass       for exemption

                  Procedure (Viva
                  Voce)
              Hence, the authorities after being found that the petitioner has
not secured qualifying marks in English Paper-I, hence he has been
declared fail, in consequence thereof, he has not been found to be suitable
to be promoted in the 3rd D.T. Examination, which is after all the scrutiny
of the candidate for promotion in the selection post.

                                            11
14.                Taking into consideration, the entire aspect of the matter in
detail and considering the fact that the petitioner’s candidature has
been considered but he has been declared unsuccessful and also taking
into consideration the fact that the other private opposite parties have been
found to be successful, thereby they have been granted promotion to the
higher post, in view thereof this Court finds that the petitioner has failed to
make out a case in his favour and on the basis of the reasons mentioned
herein above, and as such the writ petition lacks merit.
                   In the result, the writ petition is dismissed.
                                                              ….…………….….
                                                              S. N. Prasad, J.
