                                        ----------
      Notified Area Council, Titilagarh            ……………         Petitioner
                                   ---versus—

      P R E S E N T:
                        THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K. RATH
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of Hearing: 01.12.2015 │ Date of Judgment:07.12.2015
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         The instant petition under Article 227 of the
      Constitution of India is to laciniate the order dated 3.7.2004 passed
      by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Titilagarh in T.S. No.63 of
      2000. By the said order, learned trial court allowed the application
      filed by the plaintiff and accepted the pleadings subsequent to the
      filing of the written statement.
      2.            The opposite party as the plaintiff instituted T.S. No.63
      of 2000 in the court of the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Titilagarh
      impleading the petitioner as defendant for permanent injunction.

                                         2
Pursuant    to    issuance     of    summons,       the   defendant       entered
appearance and filed a comprehensive written statement denying
the assertions made in the plaint. Thereafter the plaintiff filed an
application to accept the further pleadings. The defendant filed
objection to the same. Relying the provision of Order 8 Rule 9
C.P.C., learned trial court held that since certain averments have
been made in the written statement, the plaintiff is required to give
reply to the same. Having held so, learned trial court allowed the
application filed by the plaintiff and accepted the further pleadings.
3.           Heard     Mr.    U.K.     Samal,     learned    counsel     for  the
petitioner. None appears for the opposite party in spite of valid
service of notice.
4.            The sole question that hinges for consideration of this
Court is as to whether the plaintiff can file additional plaint
subsequent filing of the written statement without making any
application for amendment.
5.           Order 8 Rule 9 C.P.C., which is the hub of the issue,
reads thus:-
             “9. Subsequent pleadings—No pleading subsequent to
             the written statement of a defendant other than by way of
             defence to set-off or counter-claim shall be presented
             except by the leave of the Court and upon such terms as
             the Court thinks fit; but the Court may at any time require a
             written statement or additional written statement from any
             of the parties and fix a time of not more than thirty days for
             presenting the same.”

                                              3
6.                       On a bare perusal of the said Rule, it is vivid and
luminescent that the defendant can file the written statement by
way of defence to set-off or counter-claim with leave of the Court
after the written statement is filed. Order 8 Rule 9 C.P.C. prohibits
any pleadings subsequent to the written statement of a defendant
being filed other than by way of defence to a set-off or counterclaim
except by the leave of the court and upon such terms as the court
thinks fit. The plaintiff can file an application under Order 6 Rule 17
C.P.C. to amend the plaint. Till and until the application for
amendment of the plaint is allowed by the Court, the Court cannot
permit the plaintiff to file additional pleadings. The procedure
adopted by the court below is foreign to law.
7.                     In the wake of the aforesaid, the order dated 3.7.2004
passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Titilagarh in T.S.
No.63 of 2000 is quashed.
                       The petition is allowed. No cost.
                                                     ……………………………….
                                                       Dr. A.K. Rath,J.
