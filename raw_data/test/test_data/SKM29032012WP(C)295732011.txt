           Date of hearing – 02.03.2012                        :            Date of judgment - 29.03.2012
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S.K.Mishra, J.           In this batch of writ petitions, the petitioners pray to quash the order
          passed by the Collector, Bhadrak on 16.09.2011 in Misc. Case No.8 of 2010
          and to direct the opposite parties to engage the petitioners as Sikhya Sahayak
          under the physically handicapped category and to grant them consequential
          benefits including back wages, seniority etc. from the date the first batch of
          candidates appointed in Bhadrak district as per the advertisement dated
          14.10.2006.

                                         2
2.              The petitioners having +2 Arts C.T. qualification applied for the
post of Sikhya Sahayak under the physically handicapped category of
Basudevpur Block under Bhadrak district in pursuance of the advertisement
issued by the Director on 14.10.2006. The petitioners further claimed that they
were duly selected for engagement as Sikhya Sahayak, hereinafter referred as
‘SS’ for brevity, by the authorities under the physically handicapped category,
they were then called upon to sign on an agreement. The petitioners appeared
before the authorities and also signed the agreement, but no engagement order
has been given to them nor copies of the agreement were supplied to them on
a plea that the select list is to be revised because the provisions of the Orissa
Reservation of Vacancies Act has not been followed. The selection of the
candidates under the physically handicapped category according to the
petitioners has been deleted. It is further pleaded that the physically
handicapped category itself is a reserved category, it admits no further
reservation on the basis of candidates belonging to the scheduled caste and
scheduled tribe categories. It is further pleaded that in violation of such rule of
law, the authorities have prepared the select list by giving reservation to those
reserved candidates under the physically handicapped category, in the
process, persons those who have secured less percentage of marks than these
petitioners have been engaged ignoring the rightful claim of the petitioners.
3.              The further case of the petitioners is that relying on the ratio
decided in Mahesh Gupta v. Yashwant Kumar Ahirwar, (2007) 8 SCC 621,
two equally placed persons as that of the petitioners from Bonth Block of
Bhadrak district namely, Gayadhar Das and Jitendra Kumar Mishra have filed
W.P.(C) No. 5606 of 2008 and W.P.(C) No.56-8 of 2008 challenging the illegal
selection procedure of the opposite parties. Since the said two persons are
equally placed as that of the petitioners and belong to the same district and
have called in question to the said selection, the petitioners awaited for the
judgment of the case, as because the ratio of the present decision will be
applicable to the persons belonging to the physically handicapped category of
Bhadrak district. This Court in aforesaid two cases directed the Collector to

                                          3
reconsider the matter as aforesaid as it relates to selection of the petitioners as
SS.
4.               The petitioners further pleaded that in view of the order passed
by this Court, the entire selection for the post of SS from the physically
handicapped category ought to have been considered afresh and the list was to
be prepared afresh in consonance of the judgment of the Supreme Court. The
Collector, Bhadrak, however, rejected the claim of those two persons on the
ground that the selection list has lost its life in the passage of time i.e. one year.
Thereafter, said two persons filed two separate writ petitions bearing W.P.(C)
Nos. 347 of 2009 and 348 of 2009, where this Court took the view that the
action of the Collector is contemptuous and issued notice to show cause. It is
further pleaded that by antedating the orders in file, the Collector in a hurry just
before his relief on transfer, issued appointment order in favour of those two
persons as SS without recasting the entire list and without verifying the relative
merit of other candidates, those who have not come to the Court. Thereafter,
the petitioners approached this Court by filing writ application bearing W.P.(C)
No. 15565 of 2008, which has been disposed of giving liberty to the petitioners
to file fresh representation to the Collector, Bhadrak, who shall consider the
same in accordance with law within a period of six weeks. Thereafter, the
petitioner filed a representation, but it is submitted that by passing a cryptic
order, the Collector, Bhadrak rejected their claim and has illegally held that the
ratio decided in the case of Mahesh Gupta v. Yashwant Kumar Ahirwar
(supra) is not applicable to the case in hand. Therefore, on the basis of such
pleading, the petitioners urge that the order passed by the Collector should be
quashed and they should be engaged as Sikhya Sahayaks.
5.               The opposite party namely, District Project Coordinator, SSA,
Bhadrak has filed counter affidavit. The opposite party pleads that the
Government of Orissa in General Administration Department has passed
Resolution on 20.09.2005 regarding reservation of vacancies of physically
handicapped category persons, sportsmen and ex-servicemen in initial
recruitment in State Civil Services and posts as per Clause 5 of that resolution,
persons with disabilities (physically handicap), sportsmen and ex-servicemen

                                         4
categories shall claim vacancies reserved for the categories to which they may
belong to. This means that persons with disabilities (physically handicap),
sportsmen and ex-servicemen, if belonging to scheduled caste will claim the
vacancy reserved for scheduled castes so on and so forth. Therefore, the
opposite party prays that the writ application be dismissed.
6.              It transpires in course of hearing of the case that while reserving
post of SS for the physically handicapped category persons, the authorities
have reserved post within that category for scheduled caste and scheduled
tribe and socially and economically backward classes categories, which is in
complete violation of the rule of law propounded by the Supreme Court of India
in Mahesh Gupta v. Yashwant Kumar Ahirwar (supra). The Supreme Court
in clear terms laid down that the authorities cannot create categories within
categories and reserve seats in the physically handicapped category for
scheduled caste and scheduled tribe and other backward classes. The action of
the opposite parties is definitely not in consonance with the ratio decided by the
Supreme Court of India.
7.              However, this Court is not inclined to grant the relief to the
petitioners on two grounds; firstly, it is very categorically contended/pleaded
that the authorities have prepared the select list by giving reservation to the
persons belonging to the physically handicapped category ignoring the rightful
claim of the petitioners. In other words, some other persons have been selected
in place of the petitioners; they are proper and necessary parties to this writ
application. As the reservations cannot exceed the prescribed percentage,
those persons have to be impleaded as parties and in case it is found that
those persons were in fact engaged, though less meritorious than the
petitioners, then their appointments have to be cancelled and the petitioners
should be appointed in their place. However, such an order cannot be passed
without giving them reasonable opportunity of filing show cause and hearing. In
absence of those candidates, the writ application is not maintainable. If any
order is passed regarding appointment of the petitioners from the existing
vacancies, then it will have the effect on other candidates. Moreover, if the
petitioners are engaged in addition to those persons, who have been

                                         5
mentioned in paragraph 4 of the writ application, then the total reservation in
the physically handicapped category will be more than the prescribed limit.
Therefore, this Court holds that the writ applications are not maintainable in
absence of the persons who have been engaged in place of the present
petitioners.
8.               Secondly, it is the admitted case of the petitioners that they
have waited till the writ application filed by Gayadhar Das and Jitendra Kumar
Mishra, which was disposed of at the first instance. Thereafter, their second
round of litigations were pending and the Court issued notice to the opposite
parties to show cause, why the Collector should not be punished for contempt
of Court. In other words, the petitioners want to take advantage of the orders
passed by the Court in favour of some persons who have filed the writ
applications before the Court. In that sense, the petitioners are fence-sitters
and they awaited the result of the earlier writ applications filed by the aforesaid
two persons and want to take advantage of the result of the cases filed by
them. Such a procedure is not permissible.
                 Accordingly, this Court comes to the conclusion that the
petitioners are not entitled to the relief claimed and, therefore, the writ
applications are dismissed.
