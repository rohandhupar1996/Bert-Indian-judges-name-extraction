            Date of Argument : 17.04.2012                         Date of Judgment : 17.04.2012
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
L. Mohapatra, J.              This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of
            sentence dated 22.10.2003 passed by learned Additional Sessions
            Judge, Jharsuguda in S.T. No.125/5 of 2003 convicting the appellant
            under Section 302, I.P.C. and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment
            for life.
            2.                From the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution,
            it appears that the deceased is the second wife of P.W.1 and the

                                    2
appellant is the son of P.W.1 through his first wife. P.W.1 had a
daughter through his second wife, the deceased, who has been
examined by the prosecution as P.W.3. The deceased, the appellant,
P.W.1 and P.W.3 were staying together in a residential quarter allotted
to P.W.1 in the Railway Colony of Brajarajnagar. It is alleged that on
03.01.2002 when P.W.1 was absent in the house, the appellant
assaulted the deceased by means of a ‘Tangia’ (axe) and left the
house. Thereafter P.W.3 went to the house of P.W.2, who happens to
be the brother of the deceased and informed about the incident. P.W.2
searched for P.W.1 and informed about the incident.          Thereafter
P.Ws.1 and 2 both came to the house of P.W.1 and found the deceased
lying dead. Both of them went to Brajarajnagar P.S. and the oral
report submitted by P.W.1 was reduced to writing and a case was
registered.    After completion of investigation, charge-sheet was
submitted against the appellant for commission of the offence under
Section 302, I.P.C.
3.           Prosecution, in order to prove the charge, examined eight
witnesses, but none was examined on behalf of the appellant
(accused), the plea of appellant being denial of the charge. Out of the
eight witnesses examined by the prosecution, P.W.1 is the father of
the appellant, husband of the deceased and also the informant. P.W.2
is the brother of the deceased. Both P.Ws.1 and 2 are post-occurrence
witnesses. P.W.3 is the minor daughter of P.W.1 and the deceased
and she is the only eye-witness to the occurrence. P.W.4 is the doctor,
who conducted post-mortem examination and P.W.8 is the I.O.
P.Ws.5, 6 and 7 are three Constables, who had escorted the dead body
for post-mortem examination, brought the accused to obtain his nail

                                    3
clippings and, therefore, their evidence may not be of much
importance so far as the case of the prosecution is concerned.
4.           Mr. Mohanty, learned counsel appearing for the appellant
assails the impugned judgment on the ground that P.W.3 being the
only eye-witness to the occurrence and she being aged about four
years only at the time of occurrence, her evidence should not have
been accepted by the Trial Court without corroboration from any
independent sources, and the Trial Court should not have recorded an
order of conviction solely on the basis of the evidence of a child
witness.
             Learned Counsel for the State submits that the evidence
of P.W.3 is corroborated by evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2 as well as
P.W.4 and, therefore, it cannot be said that the impugned judgment
convicting the appellant is solely based on the evidence of P.W.3.
5.           We have carefully examined the evidence of all the eight
witnesses. P.W.3 is the daughter of P.W.1 and the deceased. She was
only five years of age at the time of her examination in Court. She
deposed that on the date of occurrence she was inside the house along
with her mother and the appellant. Her father P.W.1 was absent and
had gone to Brajarajnagar. At the time of occurrence, her mother was
cooking. Her brother (the appellant) assaulted her mother by means
of a ‘Budia’ on the head and went away. The assault was on the
backside of the head and near the ear. After assault, the appellant left
the ‘Budia’ at the spot and went away through the back door of the
quarter. Due to assault, her mother fell down on the ground with
bleeding injuries. Thereafter she went to the house of P.W.2, her

                                    4
maternal uncle, and informed about the incident. P.W.2 informed
about the incident to her father P.W.1 and she also narrated about the
incident before P.W.1. In the cross-examination she has further stated
that the appellant dealt two blows to the deceased by means of said
‘Tangia’ / ‘Budia’. Her evidence is corroborated by the evidence of
P.W.4, the doctor, who conducted the post-mortem examination.
P.W.4 found one incised wound on the neck below the left ear and the
consequential injury was fracture of occipital bone below the said
injury. Another incised wound was also found on the occipital region.
Two other small incised wound were present on the upper part of the
neck from its left side. With reference to said evidence of P.W.4, it
was contended by Mr. Mohanty, learned counsel for the appellant that
though P.W.3 stated that the appellant had dealt two blows, four
injuries were found on the body of the deceased and, therefore, two of
the injuries remained unexplained. We are unable to accept such
contention, as it appears from the evidence of P.W.4 that two small
incised wound found from the upper part of the neck in the left side
might have been caused while inflicting the first injury on the neck.
P.W.4 also opined that all the injuries were ante-mortem in nature and
the cause of death was due to shock and haemorrhage following
injuries to the brain and bleeding from the vessels of the neck. He
also opined that the injuries could be possible by assault by means of
a ‘Tangia’.
6.            Apart from the above, from the evidence of P.Ws.1 and
2, it is found that immediately after the occurrence P.W.3 informed
about the incident to P.W.2, who in turn informed about the same to
P.W.1 and both P.Ws.1 and 2 had gone to the quarter to see the

                                      5
deceased. On their arrival, they found the deceased lying dead with
bleeding injuries and the appellant was not found in the house.
Immediately after the occurrence, the appellant had absconded and
only on 6th January he was apprehended from Jharsuguda Bus-Stand.
Therefore, we find no substance in the submission of learned counsel
for the appellant that the evidence of the child witness P.W.3 is not
corroborated by any evidence from independent sources. Evidence of
P.W.3 stands fully corroborated by the evidence of P.Ws.1, 2 and 4.
7.           Therefore, on consideration of the evidence of the above
four witnesses and the conduct of the appellant immediately after the
occurrence, we find no infirmity in the order of the Trial Court finding
the appellant guilty of the charge under Section 302, I.P.C.
Accordingly, the appeal being devoid of merit is dismissed.
