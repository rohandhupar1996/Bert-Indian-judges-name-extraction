                                    2
            In this petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner
Mrs. N. Ratnakumari has challenged the illegal arrest and unlawful
detention of her husband Dr. N. Pravakar Babu (hereinafter ‘the
detenue’) and has prayed for his release from the unlawful and illegal
detention with a further prayer to quash the same.
2.          It appears from the facts of the case that one Umakanta
Nayak, S/o-Late Damodar Nayak of Naik Sahi, Buxi Bazar, P.S-
Mangalabag, District- Cuttack lodged a First Information Report before
the Inspector-in-Charge, Mangalabag Police Station alleging therein
that his wife Namita Nayak and one Sharmista Nayak were closely
known to each other and residing in the same Sahi. On 12.3.2014,
Smt. Sharmista Nayak alleged to have taken the wife of the informant
on the pretext of visiting Sai Baba Ashram and since his wife did not
return back home for about 15/16 days, the informant contacted his
wife over telephone and came to know from her that Smt. Sharmista
Nayak did not take her to Sai Baba Ashram on 12.3.2014 as promised
rather took her to Visakhapatnam and kept her in a lodge and that she
was told by Sharmista that one her relative’s kidney was damaged and
he was in dire need of a kidney and requested her to donate her
kidney. On receiving such information from his wife, the informant
proceeded to Visakhapatnam as per the address given by his wife and
by that time his wife was already admitted in Seven Hills Hospital,

                                    3
Visakhapatnam. The informant told his wife at Visakhapatnam not to
give her kidney but Sharmista Nayak and one Niranjan assured the
informant that his family will be taken care of by them. In view of the
persuasion made by Sharmista and Niranjan, the wife of the informant
agreed to donate her kidney to save a life and accordingly Namita’s
kidney was transplanted to one Mohan Chandra Lenka of Palasuni of
Bhubaneswar    in   the  said   hospital. It  is further  alleged  that
subsequently the informant came to know that Mohan Chandra Lenka
is no way related to Sharmista and that Sharmista duped his wife and
changed his wife’s identity proof as one Banita Lenka and projected
her as the wife of said Mohan Chandra Lenka and collected
Rs.7,00,000/- in the name of the wife of the informant and
misappropriated the same. It is alleged that the signature of the wife
of the informant was taken on several written papers and blank papers
against her will and she was not aware about the contents and
meaning of those papers. The operation of Namita, the wife of the
informant was carried out on 3.4.2014 and after her recovery, the
informant lodged the F.I.R. on 31.5.2014 at Mangalabag Police
Station.
3.          On the basis of such F.I.R, Mangalabag P.S. Case No.98 of
2014 was registered on 31.5.2014 for commission of offences under
sections 120(B), 468, 471, 342 read with section 34 I.P.C. and Section

                                     4
19 of Transplantation of Human Organ and Tissues Act, 1994
(hereinafter “1994 TOHO Act”) which corresponds to G.R. Case no.
950 of 2014 pending in the Court of S.D.J.M., Sadar, Cuttack and the
investigation was taken up.
4.            According to the petitioner, even though there is no
allegation against her husband (i.e., the detenue) who is the Director,
Administration of Seven Hills Hospital in the F.I.R. or against the
authorities of the said hospital in any manner and the case appears to
be a dispute between the informant and his wife of one hand and
Sharmista and Mohan Chandra Lenka on the other and when basing on
the voter identity card, residential certificate produced before the
authorities of the hospital, kidney transplantation operation was
carried out in accordance with Andhra Pradesh Transplantation of
Human Organs Act, 1995 (hereinafter “1995 A.P. TOHO Act”) without
any ill intention rather to save the life of the patient, her husband has
been unnecessarily entangled in the case, arrested and illegally
detained. According to the petitioner, it was not within the knowledge
of authorities of Seven Hills Hospital whether the documents produced
before them were forged or not at that point of time and that the
authorities of the hospital have acted in a bonafide manner in good
faith. It is further contended that in view of the provisions 1995 A.P.

                                      5
TOHO Act, the detenue is not liable to be prosecuted in as much as all
the requirements of the said Act was followed.
5.           It is the further case of the petitioner that police officials of
Mangalabag Police Station came to Seven Hills Hospital on 2/3
occasions in connection with the investigation of the case. The hospital
authorities fully cooperated with them but even though there was no
involvement of any doctors/authorities of the hospital in the alleged
crime but all the same the detenue were arrested without any rhyme
and reason. According to the petitioner, the arrest was made without
any warrant and the ground of arrest was also not intimated to the
detenue and even though the arresting authorities is duty bound to
produce the arrested person before the nearest Magistrate within 24
hours as per the provisions under Section 57 Cr.P.C., the same has
been violated in the case. It is further contended by the petitioner that
the detenue is aged about 62 years and suffers from heart ailments
and undergone angioplasty surgery and he suddenly fell ill at the time
of arrest. Since the detenue was not produced before the Magistrate,
he was prevented from filing any bail application and thereby the
valuable statutory right has been infringed. It is the further case of the
petitioner that the police has not followed the provisions under Section
50 Cr.P.C. and has not communicated anything regarding the
particulars of the offences for which the detenue was arrested so also

                                   6
the grounds of such arrest. Only a memo of arrest was handed over to
her husband without describing the grounds of arrest and one line is
mentioned in the arrest memo “as found involved in the above noted
case”
            Thus according to the petitioner, there is violation of the
provisions of Section 41, 41-A, 50, 57 Cr.P.C. so also the fundamental
rights guaranteed under Article 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution of
India and the action taken by the police officials are mala fide in
nature and they have acted without any valid reason under law.
6.          In pursuance to the notice of this Hon’ble Court, affidavit
was filed by one Sujit Kumar Sahoo, Sub-Inspector of Police and in-
charge of Mangalabag Police Station on 1.7.2014 wherein it is stated
that the detenue was arrested on 13.6.2014 at 7.30 P.m. during
course of investigation at Visakhapatnam and after his arrest, he was
taken to KG Hospital, Visakhapatnam for medical examination where
he was examined by the Medical Officer in Cardiology Department for
which he could not be produced before the nearest Magistrate i.e., the
learned 4th Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Visakhapatnam city.
The arrest and information about medical treatment was intimated to
the learned Magistrate and the detenue was referred to NIMS,
Hyderabad for further treatment by the Medical Officer, KG Hospital,
Visakhapatnam. The Magistrate returned back the original Memo of

                                     7
Arrest and gave verbal direction to shift the detenue to NIMS Hospital,
Hyderabad and to produce him before the local Magistrate at
Hyderabad after completion of medical treatment. The requisition was
made to the Commissioner of Police, Visakhapatnam City to provide
escort party on 17.6.2014 and there was night halt at Eluru on
18.6.2014 while proceeding to Hyderabad.            Since the detenue
complained of chest pain, he was immediately admitted in the nearest
Hospital i.e., at Ayush Hospital, Vijaywada and after check up, he was
discharged on 19.6.2014 and intimation was given to the 4th Addl.
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Vijayawada as well as Patamata Police
Station on 18.6.2014 regarding his admission. After discharge on
19.6.2014, the detenue was brought to NIMS Hospital, Hyderabad and
after medical check up on that day, the medical Officer advised for
taking DTS SCAN and on 20.6.2014, he was taken to NIMS for DTS
Scan on OPD basis but it was opined by the doctor of Nuclear Medicine
Department that due to non-availability of cold kit, such test cannot be
done at NIMs before 15.7.2014. The Medical Officer further opined that
the detenue was not fit for production before the Court and then he
was taken to Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad where DTS Scan was
scheduled to be conducted on 23.6.2014. On 20.6.2014 it was
intimated to the 4th Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad
regarding the arrest and medical treatment of the detenue. The test

                                      8
was conducted on 23.6.2014 and along with test report, the detenue
was produced before NIMS, Hyderabad with requisition to give fitness
certificate and on 24.6.2014 Professor and Head of Cardiology
Department of NIMS, Hyderabad after verification of the report found
everything to be normal on cardiac point and gave fitness certificate in
respect of the detenue. Ultimately, the detenue was produced before
the    court  of  learned    4th  Addl.  Chief    Metropolitan  Magistrate,
Hyderabad. On the very day, the Advocate of the detenue filed a
memo along with the order of Hon’ble Court of judicature at
Hyderabad passed in W.P. No.17145 of 2014 upon which the learned
Magistrate directed the Director of NIMS, Hyderabad to admit the
detenue until further orders of the Hon’ble High Court and in
obedience to the said order of the learned Magistrate, the detenue was
escorted to NIMS, Hyderabad and was admitted in Cardiology
Department and on the very day, it was indicated that the detenue
possibly be brought to Cuttack by 27.6.2014.
7.           One Suvendu Kumar Sinha who is the Investigating Officer
of Mangalabag P.S. Case of 98/2014 filed an affidavit on 7.7.2014
indicating, inter alia, that on the basis of reliable information as well as
the documents seized during investigation, he was satisfied that the
detenue in connivance with the administration of the Seven Hills
Hospital, Vishakapatnam was involved in connection with crime under

                                  9
1994 TOHO Act. Documents were seized by him, which revealed that
the transplantation was done as per the approval of the detenue and
after being satisfied that the detenue was involved in cognizable
offences which provide sentence for 10 years, memo of arrest was
prepared and arrest was made on 13.06.2014 at 7.30 p.m. Since after
arrest, the detenue complained of chest pain, he was admitted in the
Cardiology Department of KG Hospital, Vishakpatnam, where he was
admitted as an indoor patient for which he could not be produced
before the nearest Magistrate, i.e., learned 4th Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Vishakapatnam city but the fact of arrest and
medical treatment of the detenue was intimated to the learned
Magistrate on 14.06.2014. The accused was referred to NIMS Hospital,
Hyderabad for further treatment by the Medical Officer of KG. Hospital,
Vishakapatnam on 16.6.2014 and the detenue was physically received
by the I.O on 17.6.2014 and on the very day on the prayer of the I.O.,
the    learned   4th   Additional   Chief  Metropolitan    Magistrate,
Vishakapatnam city intimated him to produce before the local
Magistrate after his treatment at NIMS, Hyderabad. During transit
from Vishakapatnam to Hyderabad on 17.6.2014 night, there was halt
at Eluru for taking rest but on 18.6.2014 while proceeding to
Hyderabad near Vijawada, the detenue complained of chest pain for
which he was admitted in AYUSH Hospital at Vijawada and the fact of

                                    10
such admission was intimated to the 4th Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Vijwada. The detenue was discharged on 19.6.2014 from
AYUSH Hospital, Vijwada and he was brought to NIMS Hospital
Hyderabad. On production at NIMS, Hyderabad, the detenue was
advised for DTS SCAN on 20.06.2014 but the Medical Officer of
Nuclear Medicine Department of NIMS opined that due to non-
availability of old Kit, the test could not be done before 15.07.2014
and accordingly on the very day the detenue was taken to Appolo
Hospital, Hyderabad for DTS SCAN but the doctor gave appointment of
such SCAN to be conducted on 23.06.2014.           On 23.06.2014 after
conducting DTS SCAN, the test report was obtained and the detenue
was produced at NIMS along with the test report on 24.6.2014. After
obtaining the fitness certificate in respect of the detenue from NIMS,
he was produced before the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Hyderabad on 24.6.2014. As per direction of the High Court of
judicature of Hyderabad of the State of Andhra Pradesh in W.P.(C)
No.17145 of 2014, the learned Magistrate            directed the NIMS,
Hyderbad to admit to detenue until further orders of the High Court of
Andhra Pradesh. Accordingly the detenue was admitted in Cardiology
Department in ICU on the same day i.e., on 24.6.2014. The High Court
of Andhra Pradesh by order dated 27.6.2014 while dismissing the writ
petition directed the Director of NIMS to discharge the detenue and

                                   11
handover his custody to the I.O to take him to Cuttack. After obtaining
the order of the Court on 1.7.2014, the I.O. produced the same before
Director of NIMS on 2.7.2014 and the detenue was discharged from
the hospital and produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
Hyderabad on the very day i.e., on 2.7.2014.        After receiving the
transit order from Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad on
2.7.2014, the accused was brought to Cuttack on the very day and
was produced before the S.C.B Medical college and Hospital, Cuttack
on 3.7.2014. The detenue was examined by the Medical Officer of the
said hospital and thereafter was produced before learned S.D.J.M.,
Sadar, Cuttack on 3.7.2014 and the learned Magistrate remanded the
detenue to judicial custody for a period of two weeks. It is indicated in
the affidavit that the I.O was very apprehensive to secure the health
condition of the detenue because he was carrying a patient and he was
duty bound to insure proper health care and good health condition of
the detenue till his production before the Court. It is further indicated
that there was neither any deliberate laches nor any willful intention
on his part in not producing before learned Magistrate immediately
after arrest in as much as the learned Magistrate in Andhra Pradesh
was not entertaining the production of an accused in absence of any
medical fitness certificate.

                                    12
8.           By filing Additional Affidavit, it was contended by the
petitioner that 1994 TOHO Act was enacted by the Parliament during
1994 and it came into force on 4th February 1995 in the State of Goa,
Himanchal Pradesh and all the Union Territories and thereafter, it was
adopted by all the states except the states of Jammu and Kashmir and
Andhra    Pradesh,   which have their      own   legislation  to  regulate
transplantation of human organs. The hospital being situated in the
State of Andhra Pradesh, it is governed by the 1995 A.P. TOHO Act but
not under the Central Legislation i.e., 1994 TOHO Act. According to the
petitioner’s counsel, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has not
enacted any rule for the purpose. Since in the Central Act, it is
categorically mentioned that the Act will be applicable only after
respective State Government’s adopting it by resolution under Article
252(1) of the Constitution of India and since the State of Andhra
Pradesh has not adopted such Act which was amended in 2011, 1995
A.P. TOHO Act is the only Act which governs the field and neither
Central Act of 1994 nor the Transplantation of Human Organs Rules,
1995 (hereinafter “1995 Rules”) nor the Transplantation of Human
Organs    (Amendment)     Act,  2011     (hereinafter   “2011   Act”)  are
applicable for the State of Andhra Pradesh. It is the further case of the
petitioner that Section 13 (2) (iv) of the 1995 A.P. TOHO Act indicates
that Appropriate Authority has the power to investigate any complaint

                                     13
or breach of any of the provisions of the said Act or any of the rules
made    there under      and  take   appropriate    action and  thus    the
Appropriate Authority as appointed under Section 13 can only file
complaint before a concerned Court as per Section 22 of the said Act
to take cognizance of an offence under the Act and if a private person
wants to file any complaint directly, he can do so only after giving
notice to the Appropriate Authority not less than 30 days describing
his intention to make the complaint directly to the Court. It is further
contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that since the
offence was allegedly committed by the hospital authorities of Seven
Hills Hospital situated within the State of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa Police
has no jurisdiction for registration of the case and investigation by the
Orissa Police and consequential arrest of the detenue under the
Central Act i.e., 1994 TOHO Act        is illegal and without jurisdiction.
Since the Seven Hills Hospital authorities took all precautionary
measures in the matter and took signatures of donor and donee in
their own forms for the purpose of transplantation, no offence is
committed and when Mangalabag Police visited the hospital, all the
relevant documents were produced before them for verification.
             It is the further contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner that without application of mind to the documents produced

                                    14
by the Seven Hills Hospital authorities, the arrest has been made even
though there is no violation of the 1995 A.P. TOHO Act.
            It is further contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that section 41 of Cr.P.C. has put mandatory restriction on
the power of police to arrest a person when the offences alleged
against such person prescribes punishment upto 7 years. According to
the learned counsel for the petitioner, notice should have been given
under section 41-A Cr.P.C. by the investigating agency to the detenue
and thus, there has been non-compliance of the mandatory provisions
of Cr.P.C.. Such contention was raised taking into account the
punishment prescribed under section 18 of the 1995 A.P. TOHO Act
wherein it is stated that any person who renders his service to or at
any hospital and who, for the purposes of transplantation, conducts,
associates with or helps in any manner in, the removal of any human
organ without authority, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to 5 years and with fine which may extend to
Rs.10,000/-
9.          It is the settled principle of law as held in case of Nazir
Ahmed –v- King Emperor reported in AIR 1936 Privy Council
253 which is followed in many a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court as well as different High Courts including our own High Court
that when a power is given to do a certain thing in certain way, the

                                     15
thing must be done in that way or not at all, other methods of
performance are necessarily forbidden.
             Section 60-A Cr.P.C. provides that no arrest shall be made
except in accordance with the provisions of the Code or any other law
for the time being in force providing for arrest.
10.          No doubt, different provisions of the Cr.P.C. provides for
the arrest of an accused involved in a cognizable offence. The
existence of power of arrest is one thing but the justification for such
exercise is quite another. Arresting Officer must be able to justify the
arrest apart from his power to do so. Arrest and detention of a person
cannot be made in a casual or routine manner on the mere allegation
of commission of offence and the law mandates that before arresting a
person and after arrest, procedure laid down under Chapter-V of
Cr.P.C. are to be strictly followed otherwise the arrest and the
consequent detention would be illegal. That is why Section 60-A of
Cr.P.C. was inserted by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment)
Act, 2008 (15 of 2009) which came into force with effect from
31.12.2009 along with other amendments in Chapter V of Cr.P.C.. The
police officer must be able to justify the necessity for such arrest apart
from his power to do so. Arrest should be made as the last option
restricted in exceptional cases where arresting the accused is
imperative in the facts and circumstance of the case. No arrest should

                                    16
be made by the police officer in case of non bailable and cognizable
offence without a reasonable satisfaction as to genuiness of allegation
made after conducting some investigation. Unless the principle laid
down regarding arrest is kept in mind by the arresting officer, it would
amount to denying a person of his liberty.
            In case of Joginder Kumar V. State of U.P. reported
in (1994) 4 Supreme Court Cases 260, it is held as follows:-
            “No arrest can be made because it is lawful for
            the police officer to do so. The existence of the
            power to arrest is one thing. The justification for
            the exercise of it is quite another. The police
            officer must be able to justify the arrest apart
            from his power to do so. Arrest and detention in
            police lock-up of a person can cause incalculable
            harm to the reputation and self –esteem of a
            person. No arrest can be made in a routine
            manner on a mere allegation of commission of an
            offence made against a person. It would be
            prudent for a police officer in the interest of
            protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen
            and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest
            should be made without a reasonable satisfaction
            reached after some investigation as to the
            genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a
            reasonable belief both as to the person’s
            complicity and even so as to the need to effect
            arrest. Denying a person of his liberty is a serious
            matter. The recommendations of the Police
            Commission merely reflect the constitutional
            concomitants of the fundamental right to personal
            liberty and freedom. A person is not liable to
            arrest merely on the suspicion of complicity in an
            offence. There must be some reasonable
            justification in the opinion of the officer effecting
            the arrest that such arrest is necessary and
            justified. Except heinous offences, an arrest must
            be avoided if a police officer issues notice to

                                     17
              person to attend the Station House and not to
              leave the Station without permission would do.”
              Recently Hon’ble Supreme court in case of Arnesh Kumar
v. State of Bihar (Criminal Appeal NO. 1277 of 2014, Judgment dtd.
2.7.2014) while dealing with the arrest of a person accused of an
offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less
than 7 years or which may extend to 7 years with or without fine has
held as follows:-
        “The police office before arrest must put a question to
        himself, why arrest? Is it really required? What purpose
        it will serve? What object it will achieve? It is only after
        these questions are addressed and one or the other
        conditions as enumerated above is satisfied, the power
        of arrest need to be exercised. In fine, before arrest
        first the police officers should have reason to believe on
        the basis of information and material that the accused
        has committed the offence. Apart from this, the police
        officer has to be satisfied further that the arrest is
        necessary for one or the more purposes envisaged by
        sub- clauses (a) to (e) of clause (1) of Section 41 of
        Cr. P.C.”
11.           Article 21 of the Constitution of India provides that no
person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
to procedure established by law. Procedure must be fair and not formal
and it should be reasonable, not vagarious, vague and arbitrary. When
the police is exercising his statutory power, it should be done in a fair
manner in as much as nobody has right to play with liberty of a person

                                       18
and if the exercise is arbitrary in nature, then it violates fundamental
rights guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
12.          Keeping this ratio in background, let us analyse different
provisions of Cr.P.C. so also fundamental rights alleged to have been
violated in the present case by the arresting officer while arresting and
detaining the detenue.
13.          The first provision which is stated to have been violated by
the arresting officer in the present case is section 41 of Cr.P.C.
Relevant provisions of Section 41 Cr.P.C reads as follows:-
           41. When police may arrest without warrant-
           (1) Any police officer may without an order from a
           Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person-
                    (a) who commits, in the presence of a police
           officer, a cognizable offence;
                    (b) against whom a reasonable complaint has
           been made, or credible information has been received,
           or a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed
           a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a
           term which may be less than seven years or which may
           extend to seven years whether with or without fine , if
           the following conditions are satisfied, namely;-
                    (i) the police officer has reason to believe on the
           basis of such complaint, information, or suspicion that
           such person has committed the said offence;
           (ii)         the police officer is satisfied that such
                        arrest is necessary-
           (a)          to prevent such person from committing
                        any further offence; or
           (b)          for proper investigation of the offence; or
           (c)          to prevent such person from causing the
                        evidence of the offence to disappear or
                        tampering with such evidence in any
                        manner; or

                                     19
            (d)        to prevent such person from making any
                       inducement, threat or promise to any
                       person acquainted with the facts of the case
                       so as to dissuade him from disclosing such
                       facts to the Court or to the police officer; or
            (e)        as unless such person is arrested, his
                       presence in the Court whenever required
                       cannot be ensured;
            (f)        and the police officer shall record while
                       making such arrest, his reasons in writing;
                       Provided that a police officer shall, in all
                       cases where the arrest of a person is not
                       required under the provisions of this sub-
                       section, record the reasons in writing for
                       not making the arrest;”
              Chapter-V of Cr.P.C. deals with arrest of persons and
Section 41 Cr. P.C. in detail enumerates under what circumstances a
police officer can arrest any person without an order from a Magistrate
and without the warrant. In case of M.C. Abraham –v- State of
Maharastra reported in (2003) 24 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC)
517, it is held that though section 41 Cr.P.C. gives discretion to the
police officer to arrest any person without an order from a Magistrate
and even without a warrant in the situations enumerated in that
section but he is not expected to act in a mechanical manner and in
all cases to arrest the accused as soon as the report is lodged even if
the allegation against the accused is that he has committed a
cognizable offence, the power has to be exercised with caution and
circumspection keeping in view the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case of D.K. Basu –v- State reported in (1997) 13 OCR

                                    20
(SC) 214, basing on which there has been amendment in the Code of
Criminal    Procedure    by  virtue  of  Code    of  Criminal   Procedure
(Amendment) Act, 2008.
14.          Analyzing section 41(1)(b) Cr.P.C. which is alleged to be
specifically violated in the present case, it would be seen that section
41(1)(b) Cr.P.C indicates that if a police officer intends to arrest     a
person without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant
against such person, when there is reasonable complaint/credible
information/reasonable suspicion that the person concerned             has
committed a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a
term which may be less than 7 years or which may extend to 7 years
whether with or without fine, certain conditions as laid down
thereunder in (i) and (ii) must be satisfied.
15.          Section 41(1)(b)(i) Cr.P.C. states about the existence of
reasonable belief of the police officer proposing to arrest a person
basing on a reasonable complaint,            credible information, or a
reasonable suspicion that such person has committed the cognizable
offence punishable with less than 7 years or       with 7 years    with or
without fine.
16.          Section 41 (1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C. states about the satisfaction
of the police officer regarding necessity of the arrest of the person
concerned. In which cases the necessity would arise have been

                                   21
enumerated under clauses (a),(b),(c),(d) and (e) of section 41 (1) (b)
(ii) Cr.P.C. Thus, one or more reasons as enumerated under clauses
(a),(b),(c),(d) and (e)    has to be recorded in writing by the police
officer while making the arrest of a person who is alleged to have
committed cognizable offence punishable with less then 7 years or
with 7 years with or without fine.
17.          As per proviso to section 41 (1)(b)(ii) if the police officer
feels    that   in    spite   of   a   reasonable     complaint/credible
information/reasonable suspicion that the person concerned has
committed a cognizable offence which is punishable with imprisonment
for a term which may be less than 7 years or which may extend to 7
years whether with or without fine, the arrest of such person is not
required, then also he has to record the reasons in writing for not
making the arrest.
18.          Thus, recording the reasons is necessary where the police
officer is making the arrest and even where he feels that arrest is not
required in a case where it is a cognizable offence and the punishment
prescribed may be less than 7 years or may extend to 7 years whether
with or without fine.
19.          Such recording of reasons is not necessary, if the
cognizable offence is committed in the presence of a police officer in
view of section 41(1)(a) Cr.P.C. It is also not necessary in view of

                                   22
Section 41 (1) (ba) Cr. P.C. in case of arrest of a person against whom
credible information is there to have committed cognizable offence
which is punishable with more than 7 years whether with or without
fine or with death sentence and basing on such credible information,
the police officer has reason to believe that the person concerned has
committed the offence.
20.         In the present case, the police officials had proceeded to
arrest the detenue on the basis of the registration of the F.I.R. under
section 19 of the 1994 TOHO Act in connection with Mangalabag P.S.
Case No.98 of 2004. Subsequently, section 18 of the said Act has been
added during course of investigation. Section 18(1) of the 1994 TOHO
Act prescribes punishment with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to 10 years and with fine which may extend to Rs.20 lakh
rupees.
       Section 18(1) of the 1994 TOHO Act is quoted herein below:-
         18. Punishment for removal of human organ
         without authority.- (1) Any person who renders his
         services to or at any hospital and who, for purposes of
         transplantation, conducts, associates with, or helps in
         any     manner in, the removal of any human organ
         without     authority,   shall   be     punishable    with
         imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten
         years and with fine which may extend to twenty lakh
         rupees.
21.         Similarly   section  19   of   1994    TOHO    Act  provides
punishment, which shall not be less than 5 years but which may

                                      23
extend to 10 years and also with fine which shall not be less than
Rs.20 lakh rupees but may extend to one crore rupees.
        Section 19 of 1994 TOHO Act is quoted herein below:-
            19. Punishment of commercial dealings in
human organs-Whoever-
            (a) makes or receives any payment for the supply of,
               or for an offer to supply, any human organ.
            (b) seeks to find a person willing to supply for
                payment any human organ;
            (c) offers to supply any human organ for payment;
            (d) initiates or negotiates any arrangement involving
                the making of any payment for the supply of, or
                for an offer to supply, any human organ;
            (e) takes part in the management or control of a
                body of persons, whether a society, firm or
                company, whose activities consist of or include
                the initiation or negotiation of any arrangement
                referred to in clause(d); or
            (f) publishes or distributes or causes to be published
                or distributed any advertisement,-
                (a) inviting persons to supply for payment of any
                     human organ;
                (b) offering to supply any human organ for
                     payment; or
                (c) indicating that the advertiser is willing to
                     initiate or negotiate any arrangement
                     referred to in clause (d);
            (g) abets in the preparation or submission of false
                documents including giving false affidavits to
                establish that the donor is making the donation
                of the human organs, as a near relative or by
                reason of affection or attachment towards the
                recipient
                shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term
                which shall not be less than five years but which
                may extend to ten years and shall be liable to
                fine which shall not be less than twenty lakh
                rupees but may extend to one crore rupees.”

                                     24
22.         Thus, in view of the punishment prescribed under sections
18 and 19 of 1994 TOHO Act, i.e., upto 10 years and with fine, it is not
mandatory on the part of police officer to record reasons in writing for
making arrest which is necessary in case of cognizable offence
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than 7
years or which may extend to 7 years whether with or without fine as
indicated under section 41(1)(b) Cr.P.C.
23.        Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that 1994 TOHO
Act is not applicable in the case in hand in as much as State of Andhra
Pradesh has a separate Act, i.e., 1995 A.P. TOHO Act wherein under
section 18, the punishment provided is upto 5 years and with fine
which may extend to 10,000/- rupees. In view of such prescribed
punishment, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is
that recording of reasons for making the arrest is mandatory in view of
section 41(1) (b) Cr.P.C. which has not been followed in this case by
the arresting officer while arresting the detenue.
            Section 18 (1) of 1995 A.P. TOHO Act is quoted herein
below:-
            18. Punishment for removal of human organ
            without authority:-(1) Any person who renders his
            services to or at any hospital and who, for purposes of
            transplantation, conducts, associates with, or helps in
            any manner in, the removal of any         human organ

                                   25
             without   authority,   shall   be   punishable   with
             imprisonment for a tem which may extend to five
             years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand
             rupees.
24.          1994 TOHO Act was enacted to provide for the regulation
of removal, storage or transplantation of human organs and tissues for
therapeutic purposes and for the prevention of commercial dealings in
human organs and tissues and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto. There has been certain amendment to the said Act
by virtue of Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 2011
(16 of 2011).
              Section 1(3) of 1994 TOHO Act states that such Act shall
come into force in the States of Goa, Himanchal Pradesh and
Maharastra and in all the Union territories on such date as the Central
Government may, by notification, appoint and in any other State which
adopts this Act under clause (1) of Article 252 of the Constitution, on
the date of such adoption. According to the learned counsel for the
petitioner, State of Andhra Pradesh has not yet adopted the 1994
TOHO Act which was amended in 2011 and 1995 A.P. TOHO Act is in
force in whole of the State of Andhra Pradesh and therefore 1994
TOHO Act is not applicable in the State of Andhra Pradesh.

                                   26
            Article 252 of the Constitution of India is extracted herein
below:-
            252. Power of Parliament to legislate for two or
            more States by consent and adoption of such
            legislation by any other State-(1)If it appears to
            the Legislature of two or more States to be desirable
            that any of the matters with respect to which
            Parliament has no power to make laws for the States
            except as provided in articles 249 and 250 should be
            regulated in such States by Parliament by law, and if
            resolutions to that effect are passed by all the
            Houses of the Legislatures of those States, it shall be
            lawful for Parliament to pass an Act for regulating
            that matter accordingly, and any Act so passed shall
            apply to such States and to any other State by
            which it is adopted afterwards by resolution
            passed in that behalf by the House or, where there
            are two Houses, by each of the Houses Legislature of
            the State.
            (2) Any Act so passed by Parliament may be
            amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament passed
            or adopted in like manner but shall not, as respects
            any State to which it applies, be amended or
            repealed by an Act of the Legislature of the State”.
            Thus Article 252 of the Constitution makes it clear that
where parliament has no power to make laws for the States except as
provided to Articles 249 and 250 and houses of legislature of two or
more States passes a resolution then it shall be lawful for the
parliament to pass an Act for regulating the matter enumerated in the
State List but such Act will be applicable to the States which had
passed the resolution and so far as other States are concerned, they
can adopt it afterwards by resolution passed in that behalf by the

                                      27
House or, where there are two Houses, by each of the Houses of the
Legislature of that State.
             Article 246 deals with subject matter of laws to be made
by Parliament and by legislature of the States. Article 246(3) states
that subject to clauses (1) and (2), the legislature of any State has
exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List-II in the 7th Schedule
(in the Constitution referred to as the “State List”).
             Thus, various matters of legislation have been enumerated
in three List; List I or the Union List; List II or State List; List III or the
concurrent List. The Union Parliament has exclusive powers or
legislation with respect to 97 subjects or items in List I. The State
Legislature   have     exclusive  powers     with   respect    to   66   items
enumerated in List II. The powers in respect of the 47 items in List III
are concurrent i.e., both the Union and the State Legislatures can
make laws in respect of the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent
List, but any Union Act can override the State Act in the event of a
conflict between the two on a matter in the Concurrent List.
             Entry No.6 of List II- State List indicates that the
legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws in
connection with public health and sanitation, Hospital and dispensaries
for such state.

                                     28
             Article 249 of the Constitution of India empowers the
Parliament to legislate with respect to a matter in the State List in the
national interest. In view of Article 249, if it is necessary or expedient
in national interest that Parliament should make laws with respect to
any matter enumerated in the State List specified in the resolution, it
shall be lawful for Parliament to make laws for the whole or any part of
territory of India but to make such law enumerated in the State List,
there is necessity of making a resolution by the Council of States
supported by not less than 2/3rd of the members present and voting.
             Thus in view of specific provisions of Constitution of India
and Section 1 (3) of TOHO Act, we are of the opinion that 1994 TOHO
Act as such is not applicable in the State of Andhra Pradesh as it was
not adopted by that State and 1995 A.P. TOHO Act is applicable there.
Learned Advocate General also does not dispute the contention raised
by the learned counsel for the petitioner that 1994 TOHO Act is as
such not applicable to the State of Andhra Pradesh as that State has
not adopted the 1994 TOHO Act but 1995 A.P. TOHO Act is applicable
to the State of Andhra Pradesh. Learned Advocate General submitted
and the opp. Parties have also indicated in their notes of submissions
filed on 18.07.2014 that 1994 TOHO Act has been adopted by the
State of Orissa in August 1998. It is further stated by the learned

                                     29
Advocate General that amendment to the provisions of 1994 TOHO Act
in 2011 was also adopted by the State of Odisha on 29.02.2012.
25.        Now the questions arise as follows:-
            (i) Whether 1994 TOHO Act will be applicable since the
donor and the recipient belong to State of Odisha in view of the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case when no approval/ no
objection certificate has been taken from the Authorisation Committee
constituted by the State of Odisha under clause (b) of sub-section (4)
of section 9 of the said Act? Or
            (ii)  Whether    the  concerned   hospital authorities  have
followed the procedure laid down in 1995 A.P. TOHO Act and the Rules
framed thereunder so also the guidelines issued by Govt. of Andhra
Pradesh in this case while carrying out kidney transplantation
operation?
            (iii) Whether an F.I.R. under section 19 (subsequently
added section is section 18) of the 1994 TOHO Act can be registered at
Mangalabag Police Station and          whether Mangalabag police has
jurisdiction to investigate such case and arrest the detenue?
26.          In the case at hand, the prosecution alleges that the victim
was duped from the State of Orissa and taken to Viskhapatnam;
forged documents were created to show that the donor (victim) is the
wife of the recipient and without proper verification, the kidney

                                   30
transplantation operation was conducted by the authorities of Seven
Hills Hospital, which amounts to continuous cause of action which
arose in the State of Orissa. According to the State, if the act of kidney
transplantation would have been isolated act conducted in Seven Hills
Hospital unconnected with any other act that took place in the State of
Odisha, 1994 TOHO Act might not have been applicable in as much as
State of Andhra Pradesh has not adopted this Act under Article 252 (1)
of Constitution of India and 1995 A.P. TOHO Act would have been
applicable but since the donor and the recipient both belong to State of
Odisha and approval/ no objection certificate of the Authorisation
Committee of our State constituted under clause (b) of sub-section (4)
of section 9 of the 1994 TOHO Act has not been taken which is
mandatory and the hospital authorities of Seven Hills Hospital have not
verified the same before carrying out the operation, 1994 TOHO Act
will be applicable.
27.          Section 178 (c) Cr.P.C. deals with a situation where an
offence is continuing one, and continues to be committed in more local
areas than one. A continuing offence means that if an act or omission
on the part of the accused constitutes an offence and if that act or
omission continues from day to day, then a fresh offence is committed
everyday on which the act or omission continues. As per section 178
(C) Cr.P.C. in case of continuing offence in more local areas than one,

                                       31
it may be enquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any
of such local areas. Thus, if a part of cause of action arose at place ‘A’
and it continues at place ‘B’ then F.I.R can be lodged either at place ‘A’
or at place ‘B’ so also complaint can be filed in the concerned Court at
place ‘A’ or at place ‘B’ and the Court within whose local jurisdiction
the place ‘A’ or ‘B’ situates can also enquire into or try the offence.
28.         Section 9 of 1994 TOHO Act reads as follows:-
            9.Restrictions on removal and transplantation
             of human organs or tissues or both- (1) Save
             as otherwise provided in sub-section (3), no
             human organ or tissue or both removed from the
             body of a donor before his death shall be
             transplanted into a recipient unless the donor is a
             near relative or the recipient.
             (1A) Where the donor or the recipient being near
                   relative is a foreign national, prior approval of
                   the Authorisation Committee shall be
                   required before removing or transplanting
                   human organ or tissue or both:
                   Provided that the Authorisation Committee
                   shall   not     approve    such     removal    or
                   transplantation if the recipient is a foreign
                   national and the donor is an Indian national
                   unless they are near relatives.
             (1B) No human organs or tissues or both shall be
                   removed from the body of a minor before his
                   death for the purpose of transplantation
                   except in the manner as may be prescribed.
             (1C) No human organs or tissues or both shall be
                   removed from the body of a mentally
                   challenged person before his death for the
                   purpose of transplantation
             Explanation- For the purpose of this sub-section,-
             (i) the expression “mentally challenged person”
                   includes a person with mental illness or
                   mental retardation, as the case may be;

                         32
(ii)  the expression “mental illness” includes
      dementia, schizophrenia and such other
      mental condition that makes a person
      intellectually disabled;
(iii) the expression “mental retardation” shall
      have the same meaning as assigned to it in
      clause (r) of section 2 of the Persons With
      Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of
      Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (1 of
      1996)
(2) Where any donor authorizes the removal of
any of his human organs or tissues or both after
his death under sub-section (2) of section 3 or any
person competent or empowered to give authority
for the removal of any human organ or tissue or
both from the body of any deceased person
authorizes such removal the human organ or
tissue or both may be removed and transplanted
into body of any recipient who may be in need of
such human organ or tissue or both.
(3) If any donor authorizes the removal of any of
his human organs or tissues or both before his
death under sub-section (1) of section 3 for
transplantation into the body of such recipient, not
being a near relative, as is specified by the donor
by reason of affection or attachment towards the
recipient or for any other special reason of
affection or attachment towards the recipient or
for any other special reasons, such human organ
or tissue or both shall not be removed and
transplanted without the prior approval of the
Authorization Committee.
(3A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
section (3), where-
(a) any donor has agreed to make a donation of
       his human organ or tissue or both before his
       death to a recipient, who is his near relative,
       but such donor is not compatible biologically
       as a donor for the recipient; and
(b) the second donor has agreed to make a
       donation of his human organ or tissue or
       both before his death to such recipient, who
       is his near relative, but such donor is not

                         33
       compatible biologically as a donor for such
       recipient; then
(c)    the first donor who is compatible biologically
       as a donor for the second recipient and the
       second donor is compatible biologically as a
       donor of a human organ or tissue or both for
       the first recipient and both donors and both
       recipients in the aforesaid group of donor
       and recipient have entered into a single
       agreement to donate and receive such
       human organ or tissue or both according to
       such biological compatibility in the group,
the removal and transplantation of the human
organ or tissue or both, as per the agreement
referred to above, shall not be done without prior
approval of the Authorization Committee.
       4(a) The composition of the Authorization
Committees shall be such as may be prescribed by
the Central Government from time to time.
       (b) The State Government and the Union
territories shall constitute, by notification, one or

       (5) On an application jointly made, in such
form and in such manner as may be prescribed, by
the donor and the recipient, the Authorization
Committee shall, after holding an inquiry and after
satisfying itself that the applicants have complied
with all the requirements of this Act and the rules
made thereunder, grant to the applicants approval
for the removal and transplantation of the human
organ.
       (6) If, after the inquiry and after giving an
opportunity to the applicants of being heard, the
Authorization Committee is satisfied that the
applicants     have     not   complied     with    the
requirements of this Act and the rules made
thereunder, it shall, for reasons to be recorded in
writing, reject the application for approval.”

29.          Section 9 of 1994 TOHO Act deals with the removal and
transplantation of human organs not only between the donor and
recipient who are near relatives but also those who are not related to
each other. Sub-section (5) of Section 9 indicates that a joint
application has to be made by the donor and the recipient before the
Authorisation Committee who has to hold an inquiry and such
Committee can only grant approval to the applicants for removal and
transplantation    of  human    organ   after being   satisfied  that the
applicants have complied with requirements of the Act and rules made
thereunder and in terms of sub-section (6) of Section 9, if the
applicants have not complied with such requirements then the
Authorization Committee has power to reject the application for
approval but has to record the reasons in writing. Sub-rule (2) of Rule
4A    of   the   1995   Rules   indicates   that   where   the   proposed
transplantation is between the married couple, the Registered Medical
Practitioners i.e., Incharge of transplant centre must evaluate the
factum and duration of marriage and ensure that documents such as
marriage certificate, marriage photograph, etc, are kept for records
along with the information on the number and age of children and
family   photograph depicting     the   entire immediate     family, birth
certificates of children containing particulars of parents. Form No.1 (B)
annexed to      1995   Central Rules also     enlightens   what   are the

                                     35
documents to be filed along with Form for verification. Form No. 10 is
the application form for approval for transplantation in case of live
donor which is to be completed by the proposed recipient and
proposed donor and it indicates the instruction that the approval/No-
Objection Certificate from the concerned State or Authorisation
Committee is mandatory.
30.          Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the decision
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Kuldeep Singh –v-
State of Tamil Nadu and others reported in (2005)11 Supreme
Court Cases 122 wherein Section 9 of the 1994 TOHO Act as was at
that point of time governing the field was dealt with and Hon’ble Court
after extracting the provision of Section 9 has held in paragraph 10
that the provision refers to donors who are not “near relatives” of the
recipient. (After amendment to Section 9 in 2011, the case of “near
relative” has been inserted in the said provision). In paragraph-12, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that Form 1 in terms of Rule 3 itself
shows that the same has to be filed in both the cases where the donor
is a near relative and where he is not, so far as the recipient is
concerned. It is further held as follows:-
            12. Where the donor is not “near relative” as
            defined under the Act the situation is covered by
            sub-section (3) of Section 9. As Form 1 in terms of
            Rules 3 itself shows, the same has to be filed in

                        36
both the cases where the donor is a near relative
and where he is not, so far as the recipient is
concerned. In case the donor is not a near relative
the requirement is that he must establish that
removal of the organ was being authorised for
transplantation into the body of the recipient
because of affection or attachment or for any
special reasons to make donation of his organ. As
the purpose of enactment of the statute itself
shows, there cannot be any commercial element
involved in the donation. The object of the statute
is  crystal   clear  that     it   intends   to   prevent
commercial     dealings    in    human      organs.   The
Authorisation Committee is, therefore, required to
satisfy  that   the  real    purpose      of  the   donor
authorising removal of the organ is by reason of
affection or attachment towards the recipient or
for any other special reason. Such special reasons
can by no stretch of imagination encompass
commercial elements. Above being the intent, the
inevitable conclusion is that the Authorisation
Committee of the State to which the donor and the
donee belong have to take the exercise to find out
whether approval is       to     be accorded.        Such
Committee     shall  be   in     a   better  position  to
ascertain the true intent and the purpose for the
authorisation to remove the organ and whether
any commercial element is involved or not. They
would be in a better position to lift the veil of

                           37
projected affection or attachment and the so-
called special reasons and focus on the true intent.
The burden is on the applicants to establish the
real   intent    by   placing   relevant   materials   for
consideration      of the    Authorisation Committee.
Whether there exists any affection or attachment
or special reason is within the special knowledge of
the applicants, and a heavy burden lies on them to
establish     it.    Several    relevant     factors  like
relationship if any (need not be near relationship
for   which     different  considerations      have  been
provided for), period of acquaintance, degree of
association, reciprocity of feelings, gratitude and
similar human factors and bonds can throw light
on the issue. It is always open to the Authorisation
Committee considering the application to seek
information/materials        from     the    Authorisation
Committees of other States/State Governments,
as the case may be for effective decision in the
matter. In case any State is not covered by the
operation of the Act or the Rules, the operative
executive instructions/government orders will hold
the field. As the object is to find out the true intent
behind the donor’s willingness to donate the
organ, it would not be in line with the legislative
intent to require the Authorisation Committee of
the   State    where     the   recipient  is   undergoing
medical treatment to decide the issue whether
approval is to be accorded. Form 1 in terms

                                    38
            requires the applicants to indicate the residential
            details. This indication is required to prima facie
            determine    as   to   which   is  the  appropriate
            Authorisation Committee. In the instant case,
            therefore, it was the Authorization Committee of
            the State of Punjab which is required to examine
            the claim of the petitioners.
31.         Since after amendment to section 9 in 2011 in 1994 TOHO
Act, not only the cases of persons who are not near relative but also
the cases of persons who are near relative are covered under section
9, in view of sub-section (5) of section 9, a joint application of the
donor and the recipient is mandatory and it is only after approval of
the Authorization Committee, the removal and transplantation of the
human organ can be done. In view of the decision of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case of Kuldeep Singh (supra), it              is the
Authorisation Committee of the State to which the donor and the
recipient belong to has to take the exercise to find out whether
approval is to be accorded or not in as much as they shall be in a
better position to ascertain the true intent and the purpose for the
authorization to remove the organ and whether any commercial
element is involved or not.
           In the case of Miss Sonia Ajit –v- Hospital Committee
passed    in  Writ    Petition    (L.)  No.2831    of  2011    decided

                                     39
on18.1.2012, the Bombay High Court in paragraph 12 has held as
follows:-
            12. The question is whether in a case where
            both the donor and the recipient are near relatives
            as defined by the Act, can such persons resort to
            removal and transplantation of human organ or
            issue without approaching the Authorization
            Committee where the case does not fall under any
            of the three exceptions. Although theoretically in
            such cases approval of the Authorization
            Committee would not be required, in order to
            ensure that a donor does not donate his organ or
            tissue to a stranger for commercial considerations,
            simply by alleging that applicants are near
            relatives, the Authorisation Committee will have to
            be approached to ascertain whether the donor and
            recipient are near relatives or not. That is why
            under sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 9 of the
            Act, the Authorisation Committee will have to
            satisfy itself that the applicants have complied with
            all the requirements of the Act and the Rules made
            thereunder. Once the donor and recipient are
            shown to be near relatives as defined by the Act
            and the case does not fall under any of the three
            exceptions, the Authorisation Committee has no
            power to make further enquiry about the motive of
            such donation, because in such cases there would
            be no commercial element.
32.         In view of the provisions of Section 9 of 1994 TOHO Act
and the decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as well as the Bombay
High Court, we hold that not only in cases of persons who are not
relatives but also in case of near relatives, a joint application has to be
made by the donor and the recipient before the Authorization
Committee of the State to which they belong to and the Authorization
Committee after holding necessary inquiry can grant approval for

                                    40
removal and transplantation of the human organ after being satisfied
that the applicants have complied with all the requirements of the Act
and the rules made thereunder and after such approval is accorded,
the removal and transplantation of human organ may take place in the
Authorized Transplantation Centre duly registered for this purpose
under the Act as required under section 10 of 1994 TOHO Act either in
the State to which both the donor and the recipient belong to or in any
other State.
33.        On perusal of the ratio laid down in Kuldeep Singh’s case
(supra) and Form No.1 (B) and Form No.10, we are of the view that
since in the present case the donor and the recipient both belong to
State of Orissa, the Authorisation Committee constituted under clause
(b) of sub-section (4) of Section 9 of 1994 TOHO Act by the State
Government is the competent authority and no objection certificate
should have been obtained from such Authorization Committee. In the
case in hand, as no approval/ No-Objection Certificate of the
Authorisation Committee constituted by the State Government of
Odisha has been taken, we are of the prima facie view that the
provisions of 1994 TOHO Act and the rules framed thereunder have
been violated.

                                     41
             This answers the first question that we have framed.
             In view of the answer to the first question, we need to go
to the second question that we had framed.
34.          Now coming to the next question as to whether an F.I.R.
under section 19 (subsequently added section is section 18) of the
1994 TOHO Act can be registered and whether Mangalabag police has
jurisdiction to investigate such case and arrest the detenue, according
to the learned counsel for the petitioner, section 13 of the 1995 A.P.
Act gives the Appropriate Authority appointed by Government of
Andhra Pradesh the power of investigation of any complaint or breach
of any of the provisions of the said Act or any of the Rules made
thereunder and to take appropriate action. It is contended that if any
irregularities is alleged to have been committed in the Seven Hills
Hospital, Vishakapatnam which is situated within the State of Andhra
Pradesh then F.I.R cannot be entertained at Mangalabag Police Station
and Mangalabag Police officials have no jurisdiction to investigate the
matter and as such the investigation by the Mangalabag Police and the
consequential arrest and detention of the detenue is without any legal
authority and beyond jurisdiction.
             According to the learned counsel for the petitioner,
complaint is to be filed before a competent Magistrate for taking
cognizance of the offence by the concerned Appropriate Authority or

                                      42
by an Authorised Officer authorised        in that behalf by the Central
Government or the State           Government or by the Appropriate
Authority in view of Section 22 of the said Act.
             The learned Advocate General on the other hand submits
that there is no bar in entertaining an F.I.R. in a case where breach of
any of the provision 1994 TOHO Act is alleged particularly when it is
stated to have been committed along with other offences of Indian
Penal Code as happened in this case. According to learned Advocate
General, there is no bar for investigating the offence under 1994
TOHO Act by Mangalabag Police particularly when it was committed
along with other offences of Indian Penal            Code however the
Mangalabag Police has no power to submit charge sheet under 1994
TOHO Act in view of the bar under section 22 of 1994 TOHO Act and
the police officer being satisfied after conducting investigation that an
offence under 1994 TOHO Act is made out can move before the
Appropriate Authority       to file complaint before the competent
Magistrate for taking cognizance.
             The learned Advocate General relied upon the case of
Institute of Chartared Accountant of India –v- Vimal Kumar
Surana and another reported in (2011) 1 SCC 534. In the said
the accused not being a Chartered Accountant, projected himself to
be so and submitted documents and appeared by preparing forged

                                   43
seals and documents. He impersonated himself as a Chartered
Accountant and prepared audit reports for monetary consideration. It
was urged that this being a violation of Chartered Accountants Act,
1949 and Section 195 I.P.C., other provisions of I.P.C. and Cr.P.C.
could not be pressed into service to prosecute the person concerned.
The plea of double jeopardy was also advanced on behalf of the
accused which was repealed by the       Hon’ble Supreme Court. While
dealing with TOHO Act, the Hon’ble Court held that the provisions of
TOHO Act being a part of Special Law, they have overriding effect qua
provisions of I.P.C./Cr.P.C. It was further held that the provisions of
Section 24-A, 25 and 26 of the Chartered Accountants Act contain an
expression “without prejudice to any further proceeding which may be
taken” and went on to held that it was permissible to proceed under
provisions of I.P.C. independent of the provisions of the Chartered
Accountants Act.
            Since we hold prima facie that the provisions of 1994
TOHO Act has been violated in this case, let us see as to how a person
who is violating the provisions can be proceeded with.
35.         Section 2 (b) of 1994 TOHO Act states that “Appropriate
Authority” means Appropriate Authority appointed under section 13.
Section 13 of 1994 TOHO Act indicates as to who can appoint the
Appropriate Authority and what their function is. Section 13(3)(iv)

                                    44
states that the Appropriate Authority shall investigate any complaint of
breach of any provisions of the Act or any of the rules made
thereunder and take appropriate action. Section 22 of 1994 TOHO Act
states that no court shall take cognizance of an offence under 1994
TOHO Act except on a complaint made by the Appropriate Authority
concerned, or any officer authorized on that behalf by the Central
Government or the State Government or, as the case may be, any
officer authorized on that behalf by the Appropriate Authority. In case
of a private person in terms of 22(1) (b), notice of not less than 60
days has to be given to the Appropriate Authority regarding the
commission of the alleged offence and his intention to make a
complaint to the Court. On receipt of such notice, the Appropriate
Authority may decide as to whether it is a fit case for making
complaint or not. In case the Appropriate Authority feels that it is not a
fit case to make complaint in spite of receipt of notice of the private
person or in case it sleeps over the matter then after expiry of 60 days
of notice, the private person can make the complaint directly to the
Court.
             Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the case of
Jeewan Kumar         Raut and another –v-         Central Bureau of
Investigation, (2009) 7 SCC 526 wherein it is held that the
Appropriate Authority, subject to exceptions provided for in TOHO,

                                     45
thus, is only authorized to “investigate” cases of breach of any of the
provisions thereof, whether penal or otherwise. In that case, the F.I.R.
was lodged before the Officer- in-Charge of Gurgaon Police Station not
only for commission of offence under TOHO but also under various
provisions of the Penal Code. The Hon’ble Supreme Court held the
Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station was not authorized by the
appropriate Government to deal with the matter in relation to TOHO
but it was the C.B.I. It was further held that TOHO being a special Act
and the matter relating to dealing with offences thereunder having
been regulated by reason of provisions thereof, it will prevail over the
provisions of the Cr.P.C. and the investigation in terms of Section
13(3)(iv) of TOHO must be conducted by an Authorised Officer and
nobody else could do it.
36.          At this juncture, in order to appreciate the contention
raised by both the parties, some of provisions of Cr. P.C. need to be
discussed. Section 4 Cr. P.C. briefly enumerates as to how the
investigation, inquiry, trial relating to all  the offences either under
Indian Penal Code or any other law are to be conducted. So far as
offences under I.P.C. are concerned, the procedure laid down in the
Cr. P.C. in relation to investigation, inquiry or trial will hold good but
in relation to the provisions of special law, for example, Prevention of
Food Adulteration Act, 1954, Narcotic          Drugs    and Psychotropic

                                    46
Substances Act, 1985, and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of     Atrocities) Act, 1989      etc. are concerned, the
procedure laid down under such Special Act regarding manner of
investigation, inquiry or trial would prevail and the provisions of
Cr. P.C. cannot apply. A bare reading of section 4 Cr. P.C. makes it
clear that if an offence is committed under a Special law, then the
provisions of that law would govern the investigation and trial of such
offence and a police officer is not empowered either to submit charge
sheet or otherwise proceed under chapter XII of the Cr. P.C. The
powers under the Cr.P.C. are thus subject to any special provisions
that might be made with regard to the exercise or regulation of those
powers by any Special Act. In view of section 5 Cr. P.C., if the Special
Act does not indicate the specific provision for enquiry into, trial or
otherwise dealing with such offences then the procedure of Cr. P.C.
would be applicable.     Thus    when a Special Law prescribes for a
special form or procedure, the procedure enumerated under the
Cr. P.C. is not to be followed. Only when a special law or local low
does not provide the procedure or dealing with offence under the said
special or local Act, the procedure contained in the Cr.P.C. is to be
followed.
37.          There is no dispute that State of Odisha has adopted 1994
TOHO Act and also the amendment to the said Act in 2011. Health

                                   47
and Family Welfare Department of          Government of Odisha      has
issued   notification dated 4.5.2001 wherein it is indicated that     in
exercise of powers conferred by sub-section (2) of section 13 of 1994
TOHO Act, the State Government appointed Director of Medical
Education   and     Training, Odisha   (hereinafter  “DMET”)   as   the
“Appropriate Authority”, inter alia, to “investigate” any complaint of
breach of any of the provisions of the Act or any of the rules made
thereunder and take appropriate action. In view of Section 22 of 1994
TOHO Act, such Appropriate Authority can also file complaint before
the competent Court.
            In the case of Jeewan Kumar –v- C.B.I. reported in
(2009) 7 SCC 526, it is held that TOHO is a special Act and it
provides for appointment of an Appropriate Authority to deal with the
matters specified in sub-section (3) of Section 13 thereof. An
Appropriate Authority has specifically been authorized, inter alia, to
investigate any complaint of breach of any of the provisions of TOHO
or any of the rules made thereunder and take appropriate action. The
Appropriate Authority, subject to exceptions provided for in TOHO, is
only authorized to investigate cases of breach of any of the provisions
thereof, whether penal or otherwise. There cannot be any manner of
doubt whatsoever that the provisions of TOHO shall prevail over the
provisions of the Code. The investigation in terms of Section 13 (3)

                                    48
(iv) of TOHO must be conducted by an authorized officer. Nobody else
could do it. Section 22 of TOHO prohibits taking of cognizance except
on a complaint made by an Appropriate Authority or the person who
had made a complaint earlier to it as laid down therein. If by reason
of the provisions of TOHO, filing of a police report by necessary
implication is necessarily forbidden, the question of its submitting a
report in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 173 of the Code did not
and could not arise. The provisions of the Code, for all intent and
purport, would apply only to and extend till conflict arises between
the provisions of the Code and TOHO and as soon as the area of
conflict reaches, TOHO shall prevail over the Code. It was further held
that though in terms of the Code, the C.B.I upon completion of
investigation and upon obtaining remand of the accused from time to
time, was required to file a police report, it is precluded from doing so
by reason of the provisions contained in Section 22 of TOHO. The
procedure laid down in TOHO would permit the C.B.I. to file a
complaint and not a report which course of action could have been
taken recourse to but for the special provisions contained in Section
22 of TOHO.
38.          In view of Section 22 of 1994 TOHO Act, complaint before
competent Court can be made by the concerned “Appropriate
Authority” as appointed under Section 13 or by any officer authorized

                                   49
by the (i) Central Government or (ii) State Government or (iii)
Appropriate Authority. In State of Orissa as per the notification dated
4.5.2001 of Health and Family Welfare Department of Government of
Orissa, DMET is the Appropriate Authority. As per section 2(d) of
Cr.P.C., “complaint” means any allegation made orally or in writing to
a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under the Code, that
some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offence,
but does not include a police report.
            The learned Advocate General has stated that neither the
State Government nor the DMET has authorized anybody else to
investigate any complaint of breach of any of the provisions of TOHO
Act or any of the rules made thereunder and take appropriate action.
            In view of such discussions, we are of the following
opinion:-
            (i)      FIR cannot be entertained for breach of any of
                     the provisions of the 1994 TOHO Act;
            (ii)     Mangalabag Police officials are not authorized to
                     investigate a case relating to the breach of any
                     provisions of 1994 TOHO Act;
            (iii)    Only a complaint petition is maintainable and the
                     complaint   petition  is  to  be  made     by  the
                     Appropriate Authority or any officers authorized

                                    50
                      in that behalf either by the Central Government
                      or the State Government or by the Appropriate
                      Authority;
            (iv)      When such a complaint petition is filed before the
                      competent Court, the complaint case procedure
                      as   laid  down   under   Chapter-XV    and  other
                      provisions of Cr.P.C. dealing with complaint case
                      procedure are to be followed at the time taking
                      cognizance and issuance of process as well as by
                      the trial Court during trial of the said complaint
                      case.;
39.         Thus, even if we are of the view that the registration of
F.I.R. at Mangalabag Police Station for violation of the provisions of
1994 TOHO Act is not maintainable (though such F.I.R. and the
investigation in relation to the other offences under which the case
has been registered is maintainable), the Appropriate Authority
appointed by the State of Odisha i.e., the DMET can investigate into
any complaint of breach of any of the provisions of the Act or the
rules   made    thereunder     and  thereafter   either  the   concerned
Appropriate Authority or any officer authorized by the Central
Government/State Government/Appropriate Authority file a complaint
petition before the competent Magistrate for taking cognizance and

                                    51
proceed in accordance with law against the accused persons involved
in the violation of the provisions of the said Act. Similarly, the
informant in this case or any other person interested to prosecute an
accused under 1994 TOHO Act, after giving notice of not less than
sixty days to the concerned Appropriate Authority regarding the
commission of the alleged offence and also his intention to make a
complaint to the Court can file the complaint petition before the
competent Magistrate after the expiry of the sixty days notice period.
Section 41 Cr.P.C.
40.         We have held that in the case in hand, the provisions of
1994 TOHO Act and the Rules framed thereunder, have prima facie
been violated.
            We have further held that F.I.R. cannot be entertained for
breach of any of the provisions of 1994 TOHO Act by the Mangalabag
Police Station and Mangalabag police officials are not authorised to
investigate a case relating to breach of any provisions of the said Act.
41.         If 1994 TOHO Act is excluded, so far as the other offences
under which the case has been registered i.e., Section 120(B), 468,
471, 342 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code are concerned,
none of the offences carries punishment more than 7 years and as
such Section 41 Cr.P.C. has to be complied with. In other words, the
Mangalabag police officials first of all should have reason to believe

                                   52
that on the basis of the information received, the detenue has
committed the offence and further should have recorded, while
making the arrest of the detenue, the reasons in writing as to why the
arrest was necessary. The reasons should have been one as
enumerated under (a),(b),(c), (d) and (e) of Section 41 (1) (b)(ii)
Cr.P.C. Since in the present case no such reason has been recorded
and it is simply mentioned in the arrest memo vide Annexure-4 under
Sl. No.4 “as found involved in the above noted case”, we are of the
view that it does not satisfy the reasons which is required to be
recorded in writing in view of the provisions under Section 41
(1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C.
             Since, the arresting officer in the present case has not
recorded the reasons for the arrest of the detenue, it is a violation not
only of the provisions under Section 41 Cr.P.C. but also a violation of
fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India.
Section 41 (A) Cr.P.C.
42.          Section 41 (A) Cr.P.C. is alleged to have been violated by
the arresting officer in the case in hand. This section provides that
where the police officer thinks that arrest of a person is not required
under the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 41, he has to issue
notice against the person to appear before him or at such other place

                                     53
as may be specified in the notice. On the basis of a reasonable
complaint/credible     information/reasonable       suspicion   regarding
commission of cognizable offence where the punishment prescribed is
7 years or less with or without fine, the police officer has not only to
record the reason in writing for not making the arrest but also to
issue notice for the appearance of the person concerned before him or
at such other place as may be specified in the notice. Thus in view of
Section 41-A Cr.P.C., issuance of the notice is mandatory in cases
where the police officer feels that the arrest of a person is not required
and the case is one which carries punishment upto 7 years or less with
or without fine.
43.          In the case of Hema Mishra –v- State of Utter Pradesh
reported in (2014) 4 Supreme Court Cases 453, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court held that in view of section 41-A Cr.P.C, it is
compulsory for the police to issue a notice in all such cases where
arrest is not required to be made under Clause (b) of sub-section (1)
of the amended Section 41. But, all the same, unwillingness of a
person who has not been arrested to identify himself and to whom a
notice has been issued under Section 41-A, could be a ground for his
arrest. Legislation has laid down various parameters, warranting arrest
of a person, which itself is a check on arbitrary or unwarranted arrest

                                      54
and the right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India.
       Since in the present case according to prosecution, the arrest of
the detenue was required on the basis of credible information received
against him regarding his involvement in the commission of offence
under 1994 TOHO Act, section 41-A Cr.P.C. is not applicable in this
case. This provision is applicable in all such cases where the police
officer feels that the arrest of the person is not required.
Section 50 Cr.P.C.
44.           Section 50 Cr.P.C. is alleged to have been violated in the
present case. Section 50(1) Cr.P.C. is in conformity with the provisions
of Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India. As per this section, it is
mandatory on the part of the police officer or other person arresting
any person without warrant to communicate immediately such person
the following things (i) full particulars of the offences for which he is
arrested or (ii) the grounds for such arrest and as per sub-section (2)
of section 50 Cr.P.C., the person concerned is to be communicated by
the police officer that he is entitled to be released on bail in case of
bailable offence and ask him to arrange sureties for such release.
              According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, as per
the arrest memo annexed as Annxure-4 to the writ petition, under
column No.4 where grounds of arrest is to be mentioned, it is only

                                    55
mentioned “as found involved in the above noted case.” According to
the learned counsel for the petitioner this is not sufficient compliance
of the mandate of law regarding communication grounds of arrest.
             Initiation of a case under cognizable offence is one thing
and power of arrest in such case where it is without warrant or without
an order from a Magistrate is another thing. Grounds of arrest must
indicate at least in brief the reasons and necessity of arrest. The
arresting officer must apply his mind to the allegation made against
the person concerned in a fair and impartial manner and must be
satisfied that there is reason or necessity to arrest the accused if there
is no warrant issued by the Magistrate to cause such arrest. The
accused must be aware about the same and he must have an idea as
to why he is being arrested by the police in connection with the alleged
offence. Non-compliance of the same not only violates the provisions
under    Section   50   of  Cr.P.C. but   also  the   fundamental   rights
guaranteed under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. If the
arrest is made without compliance of the statutory provisions then it
becomes arbitrary and unconstitutional and it cannot be sustained in
the eye of law.
             Article 22 (1) of the Constitution of India provides that no
person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being
informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall

                                    56
he be denied the right to consult, and      to be defended by, a legal
practitioner of his choice. Section 50 (1) Cr.P.C. states that every
police officer or other person arresting any person without warrant
shall forthwith communicate to him full particulars of the offence for
which he is arrested or other grounds for such arrest. The two
requirements of clause (1) of Article 22 are meant to afford the
earliest opportunity to the arrested person to remove any mistake,
misapprehension or misunderstanding in the mind of the arresting
authority and also to know exactly what the accusation against him is,
so that he can exercise the second right, namely, consulting a legal
practitioner of his choice and to be defended by him. The fundamental
right secured to a arrested person by Article 22 (1) is to give
protection against such arrest as are effected otherwise than under a
warrant issued by a Court on the allegation or accusation that the
arrested person has or is suspected to have committed or is about or
likely to commit any offence prejudicial to the public or the State
interest.
             In the present case, the arrest was made without an order
from a competent Magistrate and without a warrant. The ground of
arrest was not communicated to the detenue.
             Thus, we are of the view that there is violation of Article
22(1) of the Constitution of India read with Section 50 Cr.P.C.

                                       57
Section 57 Cr.P.C.
45.           Learned    counsel   for   the petitioner raises contention
regarding violation of the provisions under section 57 Cr.P.C.
              Section 57 Cr.P.C. provides for the period to which an
accused person       arrested can be detained in custody by the Police.
The first limit is that it should be reasonable period which may be even
less than 24 hours and it shall, in no case, exceed 24 hours exclusive
of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the
Magistrate’s Court. If a police officer detains a person in custody after
arresting him without warrant considering that investigation cannot be
completed within 24 hours then he must produce the accused before
the Magistrate forthwith and cannot wait even for 24 hours. After
producing the accused, the police can always pray for remand of the
accused either to his custody or to judicial custody. 24 hours
prescribed under section 57 Cr.P.C. is the outermost limit beyond
which arrested person cannot be detained in police custody.
              In the present case the memo of arrest reflects the date
and time of arrest i.e., 13.6.2014 at 7.30 P.m. as appears from the
affidavit filed by the Sub-Inspector and in-charge of Mangalabag Police
Station, Sujit Kumar Sahoo. The detenue was produced physically only
on 24.6.2014 before the learned Court of 4th Addl. Chief Metropolitan

                                    58
Magistrate, Nampalli, Hydrabad. Thus, he was not produced within 24
hours as required under section 57 Cr.P.C. Now the question is that
whether the prosecution has explained the delay of production before
the concerned Magistrate properly.
46.          The learned Advocate General Submits that in meantime
the detenue has been produced         before the competent Court i.e.,
S.D.J.M., (S), Cuttack and remanded to judicial custody by an order
of the     said Court and since the remand order has not been
challenged, writ of habeas corpus cannot be entertained.
47.          Now let us discuss at what stage the legality of an illegal
detention can be challenged in a habeas corpus proceeding.
             In the case of A.K. Gopalan Vrs. Government of India
reported in AIR 1966 SC 816, it is held that in dealing with the
petition for habeas corpus, the Court is to see whether the detention
on the date on which the application is made to the Court is legal,
if nothing more has intervened between the date of application and
the date of hearing.
             In the case of Col. Dr. B. Ramachandra Rao Vrs. State
of Orissa reported in AIR 1971 SC 2197, it is held that in habeas
corpus, the Court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the
detention at the time of return and not with reference to the
institution of the proceeding.

                                   59
            In the case of Talib Hussain Vrs. State of Jammu
Kashmir reported in AIR 1971 SC 62 , it is held that in habeas
corpus proceeding, the Court has to consider       the legality of the
detention on the date of hearing.
            All these three views were considered in case of Kanu
Sanyal Vrs. Dist. Magistrate reported in AIR 1974 SC 510
wherein it was held that the second view (i.e., detention at the time
of return) appears to be more in consonance with the law and practice
in England and has received largest measure      of approval in India.
The third view (i.e. on the date of hearing) cannot be discarded as
incorrect because an inquiry whether the detention is legal or not at
date of hearing of the application for habeas corpus could be quite
relevant, for simple reason that if on that day the detention is legal,
the Court cannot order release of the person detained by issuing a
writ of habeas corpus.
            The learned Advocate General places reliance in case of
Manubhai Ratilal Patel Vrs. State of Gujarat reported in (2013)
1 Supreme Court Cases 314 wherein it is held (para 31) that it is
the well- accepted principle that a writ of habeas corpus is not to be
entertained when a person is committed to judicial custody or police
custody by the competent Court by an order which prime facie does

                                      60
not     appear to be without jurisdiction or passed in an absolutely
mechanical manner or wholly illegal.
              The learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance in
case     of Madhu Limaye reported in 1969 (1) Supreme Court
case 292 wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held (page 298) as
follows:-
              “The two requirements of clause (1) of Article 22
              are meant to afford the earliest opportunity to the
              arrested person to remove any mistake,
              misapprehension or misunderstanding in the minds
              of the arresting authority and, also, to known
              exactly what the accusation against him is so that
              he can exercise to know exactly what the
              accusation against him is so that he can exercise
              the second right, namely, of consulting a legal
              practitioner of his choice and to be defended by
              him. Clause (2) of Article 22 provides the next and
              most material safeguard that the arrested person
              must be produced before a Magistrate within 24
              hours of such arrest so that an independent
              authority exercising judicial powers may without
              delay apply its mind to his case.”
It is further held in the decision page 299, para- 12 as follows:-
              “Once it is show that the arrests made by the
              police officers were illegal, it was necessary for
              the State to establish that at the stage of remand
              the magistrate directed detention in jail custody
              after applying his mind to all relevant matters
              …..if there detention in custody could not continue
              after their arrest because of the violation of Art.22
              (1) of constitution, they were entitled to be
              released forthwith. The orders of remand are not
              such as would cure the constitutional infirmities.”

                                      61
             It is further held that if the detention in custody could not
continue after the arrest because of violation of Article 22 (1) of the
Constitution, the arrested person detained in jail custody is entitled to
be released forthwith. The orders of remand which are routine and
passed in a mechanical manner would not cure the Constitutional
infirmities.
             In view of the above discussion, we are of the view that
once the arrest is illegal, unauthorized and is in violation of Article 22
(1) of the Constitution of India, the same cannot be cured by any
action like remand etc., in the hands of a Judicial Magistrate.
48.          The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
detenue was never produced before a competent Magistrate within 24
hours of arrest excluding the journey time till 24.6.2014 when he was
produced for the first time before a competent Magistrate at
Hyderabad and on 3.7.2014 when he was produced before the
learned S.D.J.M., (Sadar), Cuttack. The arrest being made on
13.6.2014, there is gross violation of Article 22(2) read with Section
57 Cr.P.C.
             Article 22 (2) of the Constitution of India provides that
every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be
produced before the nearest Magistrate within a period of 24 hours of
such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the

                                    62
place of arrest to the Court of the Magistrate and no such person shall
be detained beyond the said period without the authority of a
Magistrate. Section 57 Cr.P.C. provides that no police officer shall
detain in custody a person arrested without warrant for a longer
period than under all circumstances of the case is reasonable, and
such period shall not, in the absence of a special order of a Magistrate
under Section 167, exceed 24 hours exclusive of the time necessary
for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s Court.
             The learned Advocate General on the other hand submits
that the Investigating Officer in his affidavit has explained as to why
the detenue could not be produced before the nearest Magistrate i.e,
4th Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Visakapatnam city within 24
hours in spite of his arrest on 13.6.2014 at 7.30 p.m. and why there
was delay in producing the detenue before the learned Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad on 24.6.2014.
             We have seen both the affidavits i.e., the first which was
filed  by   Sujit  Kumar    Sahu,   Sub-Inspector      and  In-charge of
Mangalabag Police Station on 1.7.2014 as well as by Suvendu Kumar
Sinha, Inspector-in-Charge, Mangalabag Police Station who is the
investigating officer on 7.7.2014. The reasons assigned for non-
production of the detenue was due to taking reasonable care of the
health   of  the  detenue    and  taking   him   first   to KG Hospital,

                                    63
Visakhapatnam and then to NIMS Hospital, Hyderabad and then to
Ayush Hospital at Vijaywada and then again to NIMS Hospital,
Hyderabad and then to Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad and then again to
NIMS Hospital, Hyderabad because of the complaint of chest pain by
him. The petitioner’s counsel also does not dispute about the factum
of production of the detenue in different hospitals by the I.O. but
submits that during the gap period he could have been very well
produced before a competent Magistrate.
            Section 55 –A Cr.P.C. provides that it shall be the duty of
the person having the custody of an accused to take reasonable care
of the health and safety of the accused. When the I.O. has given
primary importance to the health of the detenue and as produced him
in one after another Hospitals for the treatment and intimated the
Magistrate i.e, 4th Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Visakhapatnam
city about the arrest of the detenue as well his medical treatment and
produced the original memo of arrest and also intimated 4th Addl.
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Vijaywada and finally after getting
medical fitness certificate from NIMS, Hyderabad produced the
detenue before the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad
on 24.6.2014, it cannot be said that there is violation of either Article
22(2) of the Constitution of India or Section 57 Cr.P.C..The time
taken in producing the detenue one after other Hospitals for

                                     64
treatment after arrest in order to take reasonable care of his health is
also to be excluded apart from the journey time from the place of
arrest to the Court of Magistrate from the period prescribed under
Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India read with Section 57 Cr.P.C.
            Thus, there is no violation of either Article 22(2) of the
Constitution of India or Section 57 Cr.P.C..
49.         In view of the above discussion, we are satisfied that
prima facie, there is patent illegality in the arrest and detention of the
detenue. In case of State of Bihar –v- Rambalak Singh reported
in AIR 1966 SC 1441 it is held as follows:-
            “…………If the Court has jurisdiction to give the
            main relief to the detenue at the end of the
            proceedings, on principle and in theory, it is not
            easy to understand why the Court cannot give
            interim relief to the detenue pending final disposal
            of his writ petition. The interim relief which can be
            granted in habeas corpus proceedings must no
            doubt be in aid of, and auxiliary to, the main relief.
            It cannot be urged that releasing a detenue on bail
            is not in aid of, or auxiliary to the main relief for
            which a claim is made on his behalf in the writ
            petiton”.
            “……………When the High Court releases a detenue
            on bail pending the final disposal of his habeas
            corpus petition, the High Court will no doubt take
            all the relevant facts into account and it is only if
            and when the High Court is satisfied that prima
            facie, there is something patently illegal in the
            order of detention that an order of bail would be
            passed. The jurisdiction of the High Court to pass
            an interim order does not depend upon the nature
            of the order, but upon its authority to give interim
            relief to a party which is auxiliary to the main relief

50.           Apart from the case in hand, several cases have been
recently reported in the State of Odisha, where innocent persons have
been duped by way of misrepresentation or for sake of money and in
most of the cases, such persons being shown as near relatives of the
recipients by creating forged documents, organ transplantation
operation are carried out either within the state or outside. The

                                      66
hospital authorities are also not properly verifying the documents
produced before them to trace out genuine cases obviously with an
ulterior motive and are therefore becoming a party to such illegal
commercial dealing. To check such racket and to meet ends of justice,
we are issuing the following directions:-
       1. The I.O. of this case is directed to take immediate step to file
          a complaint on the basis of materials already collected by
          him for the alleged violation of the provisions of 1994 TOHO
          Act before the “Appropriate Authority” in connection with this
          case. The Appropriate Authority may himself investigate the
          complaint    or   entrust   the  matter    to the   C.B.I.  for
          investigation.
       2. Once the Appropriate Authority or C.B.I. on investigation
          finds prima facie materials that there is breach of any of the
          provisions of 1994 TOHO Act or the rules made thereunder,
          the Appropriate Authority or the C.B.I will file a complaint
          petition before the competent court for taking cognizance of
          offence and proceeding in accordance with law.
       3. The State Government is directed to intimate all other States
          where the donor and the recipient belong to State of Odisha,
          not to conduct any organ transplantation operation without

                             67
   the approval/No-Objection Certificate from the Authorisation
   Committee of Odisha.
4. The State Government is also directed to consider framing
   guidelines     for processing  the  application  for   organ
   transplantation before the Authorisation Committee keeping
   in view the guidelines issued by the Government of Andhra
   Pradesh, Hyderabad and any other States.
5. The State Government is also directed to frame a scheme
   similar to the “Jeevandan” scheme in the matter of organ
   transplantation like in the State of Andhra Pradesh and
   appoint different authorities to carry out the purposes of
   such a scheme.
[
6. The State Government shall take effective steps in framing
   rules, regulations and guidelines for registration of the
   hospitals as Organ Transplant Centre (OTC) and to monitor
   their activities.
             Before parting, we record our appreciation to the
   able assistance provided by Sri J. Das, Senior Advocate
   appearing for the petitioner and Sri Ashok Mohanty, the
   learned    Advocate   General for  adjudicating the   issues
