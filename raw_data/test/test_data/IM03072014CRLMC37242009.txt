                 THE HIGH COURT OF ORISSA : CUTTACK
                             CRLMC NO.3724 OF 2009
           In the matter of an application under Section 482 of the Code of
           Criminal Procedure.
                                             --------------
           Ajaya Kumar Samantaray                         ……       Petitioner
                                            -Versus-
           Ranjita Das                                    ……       Opp. Party
                     For Petitioner          : M/s. S. Ray & C.R. Nandy
                    For Opp. Party           : Mr. G. Rath, Sr. Advocate
                                         ---------------
           PRESENT:
                  THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE INDRAJIT MAHANTY.
                          Date of judgment: 03.07.2014
I. Mahanty, J.      The present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has come
           to be filed by the petitioner-Ajaya Kumar Samantaray seeking to
           challenge an order dated 12.08.2002 passed in Criminal Revision
           No.50 of 2001 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Khurdha
           confirming the order dated 12.09.2001 passed by the learned

                                 2
J.M.F.C., Khurdha in Criminal Misc. Case No.138 of 1999/T.R.
No.203 of 2000.
2.        Shorn of any unnecessary details, it is suffice to note that a
proceeding under Section 125 Cr.P.C. was initiated by the opposite
party-wife seeking maintenance from the petitioner-husband. The said
petition came to be allowed by order dated 12.09.2001 whereby the
petitioner was directed to pay a sum of Rs.500/- per month as
maintenance to the opposite party from the date of filing of the case
i.e. 12.08.1999. That order was challenged by the petitioner in
Criminal Revision No.50 of 2001 before the court of the Additional
Sessions Judge, Khurdha. The said revision came to be dismissed by
order dated 12.08.2002 affirming the order passed by the learned
J.M.F.C., Khurdha. It appears that both the aforesaid orders earlier
challenged by the present petitioner before this Court in a proceeding
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. numbered as CRLMC No.394 of 2002 and
by order dated 21.11.2002, the following order was passed:
                “The learned counsel for the petitioner does not
         want to press this application and accordingly this
         application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is dismissed as
         not pressed”.
3.        Once again the petitioner after lapse of seven years, for
which no explanation at all exists, has come and filed the present
petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking to challenge the selfsame
orders which were subject matter of challenge in the earlier CRLMC.

                                               3
            Law on this subject is very well settled that once an earlier petition
            under Section 482 is dismissed, no challenge to the same is
            permissible once again seeking to invoke jurisdiction under Section
            482 Cr.P.C and is barred by the principles of res judicata. Apart from
            the above, it appears that this attempt by the petitioner is with the
            sole purpose of delay and does not appear to be bona fide.
            4.        In view of the above, this Court is of the considered view that
            this is a fit case where its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482
            Cr.P.C. should not be exercised in favour of the petitioner and direct
            dismissal of the same. The Registry is directed to communicate this
            order to the trial court in order to ensure that the benefit of the order
            passed by the learned J.M.F.C., Khurdha reached the opposite party
            at the earliest.
                                                             ………………………….
                                                                 I.Mahanty,J.
