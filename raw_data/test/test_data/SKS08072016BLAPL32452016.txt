       P R E S E N T:-
                  THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. K. SAHOO
       ………………………………………………………………………………………
       Date of Argument- 30.06.2016            Date of order-08.07.2016
       ………………………………………………………………………………………
S.K.SAHOO, J.      The petitioner in BLAPL No. 3213 of 2016 namely,
       Braja Kishore Mishra was the Junior Steno -cum- Registration
       Clerk and petitioner in BLAPL No. 3245 of 2016 namely, Ashok
       Kumar Sinha was the Junior Inspector of Motor Vehicles in the
       office of the Regional Transport Officer, Chandikhol respectively
       have filed applications under section 439 Cr.P.C. for bail as their
       prayer for grant of bail was turned down by the learned Sessions
       Judge in charge, Jajpur vide order dated 24.05.2016.
                    Since these bail applications arise out of the same
       First Information Report, on the basis of which Badachana P.S.
       Case No.75 dated 30.04.2016 was registered under sections
       420, 468, 471 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code
       corresponding to G.R. Case No.405 of 2016 pending in the Court
       of learned J.M.F.C., Chandikhole, with the consent of the
       respective parties, the bail applications were heard analogously
       and the same are disposed of by this common order.
       2.           On 30.04.2016 Shri Prahallad Behera, the Regional
       Transport Officer, Chandikhole presented the First Information
       Report before the Inspector in Charge, Badachana Police Station,

                                    3
Jajpur stating therein that basing upon an information regarding
fraudulent act by some tanker operators during registration of
the vehicles in his office, he probed into the matter and found
that   twenty    seven    numbers     of   transport    vehicles   more
particularly in the category of “Tanker” were registered at
various stages and the owners/agents of those vehicles produced
forged and fake documents like sale letters and connected
documents       and    on     verification     with    the   concerned
manufacturer/dealer, the fraudulent and dishonest activities of
the   violators   were   proved.     The    informant    cancelled  the
registration certificates of twenty five vehicles and issued notices
for cancellation to the concerned persons in compliance with the
settled provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and Rules as well as
the departmental circular. The registered owners of remaining
two vehicles were also issued notice for production of their
vehicles along with all original documents. The numbers of
twenty seven vehicles were mentioned in the First Information
Report in which by producing fake documents, the accused
persons had managed to get RC books, fitness certificates and
permits.
             On    receipt   of   such    First   Information    Report,
Badchana P.S. Case No.75 of 2016 was registered against

                                 4
twenty seven accused persons under sections 420, 468, 471
read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
3.           The Inspector in Charge of Badachana Police Station
himself took up investigation of the case and recorded the
statement of the informant who stated that the staffs of RTO
Office, Chandikhole including the petitioner Ashok Kumar Sinha
who was the Junior Inspector of Motor Vehicles knowing fully
well that the documents produced in the Office for registration of
the vehicles were fake, facilitated the unscrupulous owners
through the dalals/agents to get the registration numbers,
fitness certificates and permits and the petitioner Ashok Kumar
Sinha used his own personal I.D. and password which was not
transferable, from which it was established that deliberately he
had committed the offence for his personal gain.
             On 02.05.2016 on the production of the informant,
the Investigating Officer seized the personal files of all the FIR
mentioned twenty seven vehicles as per seizure list. On
03.05.2016 the Investigating Officer received reply from the
informant in connection with the duties distributed among his
staffs. Petitioner Braja Kishore Mishra who was the Junior Steno
was allotted with the registration charges in respect of certain
series of vehicles.

                                 5
             During course of investigation, the Investigating
Officer also collected materials which indicated that the policies
of the Insurance Company which were produced at the time of
registration of the tankers before RTO, Chandikhole were fake.
Request letter was sent to SP, Jajpur to move the bank
authorities to freeze the bank accounts of the tanker owners and
transporters in which they had received illegal money by using
new registration numbers in their old vehicles for transportation
of petroleum products illegally and taking part in the tender
process    without  having  such   vehicles  against  which   new
registration numbers had been obtained from the office of the
RTO along with road permits and fitness certificates. The
statement of one Kalyan Ch. Samal, Jr. Clerk in the office of
RTO, Chandikhole was recorded who stated that fake sale letter,
tax invoice, roadworthy certificate and insurance certificate etc.
were produced before the petitioner Braja Kishore Mishra for
registration of the tankers who never verified the genuineness of
those documents and fixed the fees of the tankers and asked the
owners to deposit the fees. He further stated that the petitioner
Ashok Kumar Sihna had signed on the hardcopies of all the
twenty seven files as well as online in the office computer
system and issued fitness certificates of all the twenty seven
vehicles and neither the petitioner Braja Kishore Mishra nor the

                                   6
petitioner Ashok Kumar Sihna had physically seen the tankers
before or after issuance of registration numbers, permits and
fitness certificates. He further stated that such tankers were
never existing and knowing fully well that the documents
produced in the Office for the registration of the vehicles were
fake,    facilitated   the   unscrupulous    owners  through    the
dalals/agents to get the registration numbers, fitness certificates
and    permits.    The   Investigating officer  also obtained   the
procedure for registration of a tanker from the RTO, Chandikhole
and documents required for such registration.
              Petitioners Braja Kishore Mishra and Ashok Kumar
Sihna were taken into custody on 19.05.2016 as prima facie
evidence under sections 420/468/419/471/120-B of the Indian
Penal Code was made out against them and they were forwarded
to Court.
4.            Mr. Dharanidhar Nayak, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for the petitioner Braja Kishore Mishra while urging for
bail contended that the petitioner has completed twenty two
years of unblemished service career in the RTO Office and during
his entire career, he had discharged his duties with full sense of
devotion, honesty, sincerity and integrity and the petitioner was
just a Steno and he was in no way involved in the alleged crime
and had no role to play in the registration of tankers. It was

                                 7
further  contended    that   the  petitioner  had  no   knowledge
regarding the false documents and the ingredients of the
offences are not made out against him and his wife is suffering
from neuro problems and there is no other male member in the
family to look after his ailing wife and the petitioner is a
Government Servant and there is no chance of his absconding to
evade trial or tamper with the prosecution witnesses and
therefore, the bail application may be favourably considered.
            Mr.   Rajat   Ku.   Rath,   learned  Senior  Advocate
appearing on behalf of petitioner Ashok Kumar Sihna on the
other hand emphatically contended that the petitioner has not
been named in the First Information Report which was lodged
after due inquiry/probe and the contents of the FIR are
completely contradictory to the 161 Cr.P.C statements recorded
during investigation. It was further contended that since last two
years, the petitioner was suffering from chronic renal failure and
under continuous hemodialysis at KIMS, Bhubaneswar twice in a
week and he was also admitted in Nephrology Department at
S.C.B. Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack from jail for a
routine dialysis. He drew the attention of this Court to the
medical documents which are annexed to the bail petition as
Annexure-3 Series. It was further contended that the petitioner
is a Government Servant and there is no chance of his

                                  8
absconding and therefore, the bail application may be favourably
considered.
             Both the learned counsels submitted that in the
meantime a number of other co-accused persons have been
granted either anticipatory bail or regular bail and therefore, on
the ground of parity and equity, the bail applications of the
petitioners may be favourably considered. In support of such
contentions, they filed the copies of the bail orders which were
taken on record.
5.           Mr. Arupananda Das, learned Addl. Government
Advocate on the other hand contended that the statements
collected   during   investigation   clearly  indicate   the  unholy
combination between the petitioners on the one hand and the
owners of the vehicles, dalals/agents on the other and fake sale
letter, tax invoice, road worthy certificate, insurance certificate
etc. were produced before the petitioner Braja Kishore Mishra
who without verification of genuineness of such documents, fixed
the fees for the tankers and the petitioner Ashok Kumar Sihna
without    physically   verifying   the    tankers   issued   fitness
certificates. The learned State Counsel further contended that
the old tankers by virtue of new fake registration numbers were
utilized for transportation of oil and there was no explosive
licence as a result of which there was risk to the lives of innocent

                                  9
persons. It is further contended that the petitioners had taken
bribe from the agents/dalals, owners and they had conspired
together in committing the offence in a preplanned manner. The
learned counsel for the State placed the statement of the
informant Prahallad Behera who has stated as to how the tanker
owners in connivance with the petitioners have committed the
offence by managing to get registration numbers of the tankers
by producing forged documents and thereby able to participate
in the tender process of different oil manufacturing companies as
a result of which the genuine persons having new tankers were
deprived of getting the transportation contract. The witness has
further stated that petitioner Ashok Kumar Sinha after accepting
bribe from dalals indulged himself in such illegal activities and
thereby lowered down the sanctity of the registration office. The
learned counsel for the State further placed the statement of the
Bikash Kumar Choudury, MVI, RTO Office, Chandikhole which
indicates the illegalities committed by the two petitioners in their
respective capacities. The learned counsel for the State also
drew the attention of the Court to different documents to
indicate how forgery has been committed. The learned counsel
for the State urged that the investigation is under progress and
the charges are very serious and the further investigation is
likely to reveal the detail materials relating to criminal conspiracy

                                  10
between the accused persons and at this stage if the petitioners
are enlarged on bail, there is likelihood of tampering with the
evidence and destruction of material evidence.
6.            Chapter IV of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereafter
“1988 Act”) deals with a registration of the motor vehicles.
Section 41 of the 1988 Act deals with procedure for registration
of the motor vehicle. Section 56 of the 1988 Act deals with
issuance of certificate of fitness of transport vehicles. Sub section
(1) of section 56 clearly lays down that a transport vehicle shall
not be deemed to be validly registered, for the purposes of
section 39, unless it carries a certificate of fitness in the
prescribed form. Section 59 of the 1988 Act deals with the power
of the Central Government to fix the age limit of motor vehicle.
Chapter V of the 1988 Act deals with general provision as to
application for permits for different types of vehicles and
procedure for making such application and grant of permits etc.
              Rule 22 of the Orissa Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993
(hereafter “1993 Rules”) deals with issuance and renewal of
fitness certificate. The role of an Inspector of Motor Vehicles or
Junior Inspector of Motor Vehicles in the process of issuance and
renewal of such certificates has been vividly laid down under this
rule. It is the bounden duty of the owner or a person in control
of the vehicle to produce the vehicle before the inspecting

                                  11
authority on the date, time and place fixed for the inspection of
the vehicles.
             Thus in view of the 1988 Act and 1993 Rules, unless
an Inspector or Junior Inspector of Motor Vehicles after physical
verification of the vehicle grants fitness certificate, a transport
vehicle cannot be validly registered.
             Looking at the letter of RTO, Chandikhole dated
19.05.2016 regarding detail procedure for registration of tanker,
it reveals that an application in Form 20, a sale certificate in
Form 21 issued by dealer, road worthiness certificate in Form 22
issued by manufacturer, Form 22 A issued by bodybuilder, proof
of address are required for registration. After receipt of such
documents from the owner or on behalf of the owner, the
Dealing Assistant (Junior Steno) after verifying the record,
calculate the tax and fees. After deposit of the required tax and
fees, he puts up the documents before the RTO with a note sheet
giving his initial. Then the RTO forwards the records to IMV/
Junior. Then IMV inspects the vehicle and after inspection, the
Data Entry Operator who assists IMV/Junior enters the criteria of
compliance of Chapter VII of 1988 Act. The record is then sent to
Smart Chips for detail entry in Vahan Software. After detail
entry, the RTO verifies the entry to allow the Dealing Assistant
for   assignment    of  registration mark   for   the  purpose   of

                                 12
registration and then the record is kept by the Dealing Assistant.
After assignment of the registration number, the RTO pushes for
print of RC smart card and particulars. After the cards are
printed by a Smart Chip Operator, Asst. Programmer receives
the smart cards and approve in key management system and
return to SCL, from where it is despatched to the owner in the
given address.
7.           Taking a bird’s eye view of the aforesaid provisions
and procedure, it becomes crystal clear that both the petitioners
have got vital roles to play in the process of registration of the
tankers. From the materials available on record, it appears that
the petitioner Braja Kishore Mishra who was the Junior Steno
was also working as Registration Clerk as per the orders of RTO,
Chandikhole since 2013 and at the threshold, he was supposed
to verify the genuineness of the documents produced for the
registration of the tankers. Prima facie it appears that he has
deliberately   neglected   in  his  duties  and  without    proper
verification of the required documents for registration of the
vehicle and accepting the fake documents, he had moved the file
to the RTO after calculating the tax and fees. The other
petitioner Ashok Kumar Sinha who was the Junior Inspector of
Motor Vehicles without inspecting the tankers in actuality
granted fitness certificates and put the fake engine and chassis

                                13
numbers as per the fake sale letters online for registration and
fitness by using his personal ID even though such tankers did
never exist.
8.           Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that
some of the co-accused persons have been granted bail under
sections 438 Cr.P.C. and 439 Cr.P.C. and the petitioners stand
on the similar footing and therefore, the bail applications be
favourably considered on the ground of parity and equity.
Learned counsel for the State on the other hand countered such
submissions and contended that the case of the petitioners
stands altogether in a different footing than the co-accused
persons who have been enlarged on bail and therefore, the
petitioners cannot claim parity with the other co-accused
persons.
             On perusal of the bail orders dated 24.06.2016
passed in BLAPL No.3540 of 2016 and BLAPL No.3588 of 2016 in
respect   of   co-accused  Amrik   Singh  and   Sukadeva    Parey
respectively who were the owners of some of the offending
tankers, it is seen that taking note of the submissions that
owners of the vehicles have been enlarged on bail and their
custody period since 31.05.2016, bail was granted.
             Similarly on perusal of the anticipatory bail orders
dated 05.05.2016 in respect of co-accused persons Chhaya Kar,

                                  14
Khirod Chandra Patra, Mrutunjaya Kar, Prasanta Kumar Khuntia,
Ashis Tiwari and Bharat Chandra Pradhan passed in ABLAPL Nos.
6472 of 2016, 6475 of 2016, 6477 of 2016, 6478 of 2016, 6479
of 2016 and 6480 of 2016 respectively, it is noticed that
considering only the nature of offences alleged, anticipatory bail
has been granted. The          persons who     have   been granted
anticipatory bail are also the owners of some of the offending
vehicles.
             Thus it is clear from the bail orders which have been
produced by the learned counsels for the petitioners that none of
the officials/staffs of the Office of Regional Transport Officer,
Chandikhole have been enlarged on bail.
             Doctrine of equality in bail matters in case of persons
similarly situated flows from Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. The grant of bail is not a mechanical act. A Judge is not
bound to grant bail to an accused on the ground of parity where
the order granting bail to the co-accused contains no cogent
reasons. Such an order can never form the basis for a claim of
parity. Parity is considered as one of the grounds but cannot be
the sole ground for grant of bail. The desirability of consistency
to grant bail to an accused may arise only when the Court finds
that the case of the applicant is identically similar to the co-
accused who has been enlarged on bail. Even then also, the

                                 15
Court is not bound to grant bail, if after careful scrutiny, the
Court is satisfied that after release of the co-accused similarly
situated, some more clinching materials have been collected and
some developments have been made in the investigation which
justifies not to grant bail even though the State has not moved
the higher Court for cancellation of the bail order in respect of
the co-accused inasmuch as grant of bail at such a stage
accepting the plea of parity would be prejudicial to the interest of
law, a negation of rule of law and it will not be in consonance
with the public interest.
             After going through the bail orders produced by the
learned counsels for the petitioners and carefully considering the
nature of accusations leveled against the petitioners, I am of the
view that the petitioners who are the Government Officials could
have easily checked the commission of the crime by rejecting the
fake documents produced for the registration of the vehicles and
not granting fitness certificates. Their deliberate laches for
obvious    reasons   resulted  in  opening  the    flood  gate   for
commission of such offences in the office of the R.T.O.,
Chandikhole and therefore, the principle of parity for grant of bail
as urged by the learned counsel for the petitioners would not be
applicable to the petitioners and accordingly, such contentions
are hereby rejected.

                                  16
9.           So    far  as  petitioner  Braja   Kishore  Mishra    is
concerned, if after completion of so many years of service career
in the R.T.O. Office, Chandikhole when he was entrusted with an
important assignment as Registration Clerk, he should have been
more duty conscious and should not have indulged in such type
of illegal activities in passing fake documents produced before
him for registration of tankers. Ailment of his wife as contended
cannot be a ground to grant him bail at this stage.
             Even though the petitioner Ashok Kumar Sinha was
suffering from some ailment but it appears that jail authorities
are taking his due care and producing him in the premier
hospital of the State for his treatment and nothing has been
alleged against the jail authorities for lack of their initiative to
take care of his health. The misconduct and dereliction of the
duty on the part of the petitioner is very serious and at this
juncture, it would not be proper to grant him bail on the ground
of his ailment.
10.          After bestowing my anxious consideration to weigh
and analyse the materials available on record with utmost care
and    caution,   the   nature  of   accusations,  the  punishment
prescribed for the offences, prima facie availability of supporting
materials to establish such accusations, the continuance of
investigation which is likely to unearth many vital links, role

                                    17
played by the petitioners in the entire episode, the impact of
such offences on the society, the manner in which taking
advantage of their position, the petitioners created their own
heaven for their self interest by creating hell for others, without
entering into the detailed examination of the materials on record
and elaborate discussion on the merits of the case, I am of the
view that at this stage, it would not be proper to release the
petitioners on bail.
                 Accordingly, the bail applications filed by petitioners
Braja Kishore Mishra and Ashok Kumar Sinha sans merits and
hence stand rejected.
                                                       …………………………
                                                         S.K. Sahoo, J.
