Dhar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent.
2.      This second appeal is preferred by the defendant against the judgment and decree
dated 11.07.2008, passed by the learned Civil Judge, Nagaon, in Title Appeal No.1/2004,
affirming the judgment and decree dated 04.12.2003, passed by the learned Civil Judge (Jr.
Divn.), Hojai, at Sankardev Nagar, in Title Suit No.19/2001, whereby the suit of the plaintiff
was decreed.
RSA No.1/2009                                                                  Page 1 of 5

3.       This second appeal was admitted to be heard by an order passed on 07.01.2009, on
the following substantial question of law:-
                        “Whether the findings of the learned lower Appellate Court about the
                        title of the plaintiff/respondent based on the sale deed vide Ext.5 is
                        according to the provisions of Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act
                        as well as of Section 47 of the Registration Act ?”
4.       The counsel for the parties have submitted that in the substantial question of law,
inadvertently, “Ext.5” has been written in place of “Ext.1”.
5.       The case of the plaintiff is that 3 Katha, out of 4 Katha of land covered by Dag No. 140
of Periodic Patta No. 279 of Veluguri village was purchased by him vide registered sale deed
No. 683/98, from pro forma defendant No. 2. While he was possessing and enjoying the land
as owner and title holder, his name was also recorded in the land records in Mutation Case
No.75/98-99. The defendant having no right, title and interest over the suit land trespassed
into the land on 23.12.1998 and raised bamboo fence. On being protested, the plaintiff was
threatened with dire consequences and, as a result, the plaintiff was compelled to file Title
Suit No. 9/99 against the defendant under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. But due
to some formal defects in the suit, the suit was allowed to be withdrawn by an order dated
13.03.2001 with liberty to file afresh.
6.       On withdrawal of the suit, the defendant made two temporary sheds on 14.04.2001
and, thereafter, on 01.05.2003, again erected 3 temporary rooms. It was found that in the
sale deed the name of Kanaiya Satnami, in respect of northern boundary of the land, was
wrongly written as Gomiya Satnami and, accordingly, on approach being made, the vendor
executed a registered rectification deed, being Deed No.1997 of 2001, to rectify the same.
Accordingly, the plaintiff filed the suit for right, title and interest and for recovery of
possession, etc.
7.       The defendant No.1 filed written statement stating that the suit was filed by the
plaintiff in collusion with the pro forma defendant No. 2. The case set out by the defendant
No. 1 is that he had purchased the land from the pro forma defendant No. 2 vide registered
deed bearing No. 375/1992 and that pro forma defendant No. 2 had accepted the
consideration money and he was put in possession of the said land. By amendment of the
RSA No.1/2009                                                                       Page 2 of 5

written statement, it is also stated that pro forma defendant No. 2 filed a suit against him,
which is registered as Title Suit No. 6/2002. It is stated that on 12.11.1998, pro forma
defendant No. 2 filed a petition in Misc. Case No.19/98-99 stating that pro forma defendant
No. 2 had sold 3 (three) Katha of land to the defendant No. 1 vide registered sale deed No.
1719, dated 10.05.1998 and also stating that he had not sold the land to anybody.
8.       On the basis of the pleadings, the learned Trial Court framed the following Issues:
         “1. Is there any cause of action for the suit ?
         2. Whether the plaintiff in collusion with the pro forma defendant No.2 have instituted
             this suit to defeat the claim of the defendant ?
         3. Whether the plaintiff has right, title and interest over the suit land ?
         4. Whether the defendant has purchased the suit land from the pro forma defendant
             by executing a registered deed of sale ?
         5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree as prayed for ?
         6. To what relief/reliefs are the parties entitled to ?”
9.       The plaintiff examined 5 witnesses and exhibited some documents. The defendants
also examined 7 witnesses and exhibited some documents. The pro forma defendant No. 2
had examined himself as PW-2.
10.       Mr. K. K. Mahanta has submitted that the appellant having purchased 1 Katha of land
in 1992, there should have been a reference to him in one of the boundaries of sale deed
executed in favour of the plaintiff, Ext-1. However, the name of the appellant is not mentioned
in any of the boundaries. It is also submitted that the rectification deed having been executed
subsequent to the registration of the sale deed of the appellant on 10.06.1998, declaration of
right, title and interest in favour of the plaintiff is not sustainable in view of Section 47 of the
Registration Act, 1908, and Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
11.      Mr. Dhar has submitted that the argument of the learned Senior Counsel for the
appellant is wholly misconceived as sale deed was executed in favour of the appellant prior in
point of time and the fact that some rectification had to be effected at a later point of time,
does not mean that the sale deed was executed subsequently, i.e., on the date of rectification.
It is also submitted by him that in the northern boundary there was already another person
named Bhakhow Satnami and, therefore, there was also no difficulty in identifying the land
even without the deed of rectification. In fact, in the sale deed dated 18.03.1998, the name of
RSA No.1/2009                                                                         Page 3 of 5

the vendor himself was wrongly written in the northern side. He has also submitted that there
was no occasion for putting the name of the appellant in any of the boundaries when the pro
forma defendant No. 2 deposed that he had never sold any land to the defendant No. 1, for
which he had also filed a suit for cancellation of the sale deed.
12.      I have considered the submission of the learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the evidence on record.
 13.     Vide Ext-Kha, registered sale deed No. 375/1992, pro forma defendant No. 2 was
shown to have transferred 1 Katha of land to defendant No. 1. The admitted position is that a
suit was filed by pro forma defendant No. 2 (PW-2), against defendant No. 1, alleging that the
aforesaid sale deed was fraudulent as he had not executed the sale deed. PW-2 also stated
that he had not executed any other sale deed in favour of the defendant No. 1. In the written
statement, initially, stand was taken that vide sale deed No. 375/1992, the suit land was
transferred to him. Subsequently, defendant relied on a purported petition of the pro forma
defendant No. 2 and by way of amendment of the written statement, stated that PW-2 had
sold 3 Katha of land vide sale deed dated 10.05.1998, Ext.-Ga (should have been 10.06.1998)
to him. From a perusal of the written statement (Ext-3), in Title Suit No. 9/99, filed by the
defendant No. 1/appellant, it is seen that he had taken a stand that as he was having no land
to live, he had been allowed by the pro forma defendant No. 2 in the present suit to live in the
suit land and, thereafter, 1 Katha of land was sold to him vide registered Sale Deed No.
375/92.     Furthermore, it is stated in the said written statement that on 10.06.98 Kanaiya
Satnami had executed another sale deed in respect of the suit land vide registered Sale Deed
No. 1719/98. Thus, the stand taken in the said suit and the present suit is entirely different
and the learned Lower Appellate Court also took note of this aspect of the matter.
14.      The contention of the appellant that Sale Deed No. 1719/98 was executed as a
rectification deed of the Deed No. 375/92 was rejected by the learned Lower Appellate Court,
but, while holding so, the exhibit number is wrongly referred to as ‘Ext.-5’ as the Sale Deed
No. 1719/98 was exhibited as ‘Ext.-Ga’.
15.       So far as 1 Katha of land, involved in Ext-Kha, is concerned, this Court will not express
any opinion. As regards the sale deed (Ext-1) in favour of the plaintiff is concerned, the
same is dated 18.03.1998, which is evidently prior in point of time to the sale deed dated
10.06.1998, Ext-Ga, relied on by the defendant. Both the courts below have held that plaintiff
RSA No.1/2009                                                                       Page 4 of 5

had proved the said sale deed. So far as sale deed dated 10.06.1998, Ext-Ga is concerned, the
learned Trial Court noted that the said sale deed was executed not within the office of the
Sub-Registrar, at Hojai, where the land is situated, but in Nagaon. It is to be noted that
Section 28 of the Registration Act, 1908 provides that a sale deed, amongst others, shall be
presented for registration in the office of Sub-Registrar within whose Sub-District the whole or
some portion of the property, to which such document relates, is situated.
16.     The plaintiff also exhibited the Deed of Rectification as Ext-5, by which name of one of
the persons in the northern boundary was corrected. In the sale deed dated 18.03.1998,
northern boundary of the land was shown as follows:
                “Gomiya Satnami and Bhakhow Satnami.”
        By the Registered Rectification Deed, it is corrected as “Kanaiya Satnami and Bhakhow
Satnami”.
17.     Both the courts below have concurrently found that the appellant duly proved the
execution of the sale deed, Ext-1. There is no merit in the contention of Mr. Mahanta that sale
deed, Ext-1, is to be deemed to be executed only with effect from date of registration of Deed
of Rectification, Ext-5, on 21.05.2001. The import of Section 48 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 is that a sale deed executed earlier would have priority over a subsequent deed of
transfer. Present is a case where the sale deed executed in favour of the plaintiff is earlier in
point of time to the sale deed executed in favour of defendant No. 1. In the facts of the case,
Section 47 of the Registration Act, 1908 which provides that a registered document shall
operate from the time which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof
had been required or made, and not from the time of its registration, does not come into play
at all.
18.     In view of the above discussions, I find no merit in this appeal and, accordingly, the
same is dismissed. Substantial question of law is answered against the appellant. No cost.
19.     Registry will send back the records.
                                                                      JUDGE
