                          HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                                  W.P.(C) No.9500 of 2012
       In the matter of an application under Article        227 of the Constitution of
       India.
                                          -------------
       Rita Mohanty and another                       ….              Petitioners
                                             Versus
       Mamata Kumari Sasmal and others                ….              Opposite parties
                          For Petitioners     --      Mr.Samir Kumar Mishra,
                                                      Advocate
                          For Opp. Parties --         Mr.Khetramohan Dhal,
                                                      Advocate
       PRESENT:
                          THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
       Date of Hearing :22.02.2017              :        Date of Judgment: 03.03.2017
DR. A.K.RATH, J. This petition challenges the judgment dated 26.8.2010 passed
       by the learned Second Additional District Judge, Cuttack in Review Petition
       No.7 of 2009, vide Annexure-6, dismissing the same.
       2.           The mother of the petitioners, Chanchala Dei as plaintiff
       instituted the suit for permanent injunction impleading opposite parties 1
       and 2 as defendants. The defendants filed a counter claim for a decree of
       mandatory     injunction  against    the   plaintiff directing  her   to  remove
       encroachment from the suit land. The suit and counter claim were tried by
       the learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), 2nd Court, Cuttack. The suit was
       dismissed, whereas the counter claim was decreed. Aggrieved by the said
       judgment and decree, the plaintiff filed R.F.A.No.54 of 2004 and R.F.A.No.55

                                         2
of 2004 before the learned 2nd Additional District Judge, Cuttack, which
were eventually dismissed. Thereafter she filed Review Petition No.7 of 2009
under Order 47 Rule 1 C.P.C. to review the judgment on the ground that
there were some mistakes in the appreciation of the evidence in the appeal.
The vital documents could not be filed in the appeal since the same were not
in existence till disposal of the appeal. Placing reliance on the mutation
R.O.R. in respect of khata No.146 dated 7.4.2009 issued by the Tahasildar,
Sadar, Cuttack, a submission was advanced that out of Ac.0.13 dec. of land,
the Tahasildar found that there is a private road over Ac.0.06 dec. of land
and the balance       Ac.0.07 dec. of land is homestead, which have been
recorded in the R.O.R. The opposite parties have no semblance of right, title
and interest over plot nos.1300 and 1300/2964. The petitioners have a right
of passage over Ac.0.06 dec. appertaining to plot no.1300. The opposite
parties filed objection stating inter alia that there is no error apparent on the
face of the record. The R.O.R. has been obtained by playing fraud. The entry
in mutation R.O.R. neither creates nor extinguishes title. The R.O.R. was
obtained after the judgment was delivered. They were not parties to the
mutation proceeding and as such not bound by the same. The learned
appellate court came to hold that finding of the learned trial court was
confirmed in appeal on analysis of evidence on record. The judgment has
attained finality. The mutation R.O.R. was obtained much after delivery of
the judgment. Mutation of property in revenue record does not create or
extinguish title. Relying on the same, the judgment cannot be reviewed.
3.            Mr.Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioners argued with
vehemence that mutation R.O.R. was not within the knowledge of the
petitioners. The same could not be produced at the time of hearing of the
appeal. Discovery of evidence is a ground of review. The same has a vital
bearing in the case. In view of the same, the learned appellate court fell into
patent error of law in allowing the application for review.

                                         3
4.           Per contra, Mr.Dhal, learned counsel for the opposite parties
submitted that there is no error apparent on the face of the record. The
learned appellate court is justified in rejecting the application.
5.          The jurisdiction and scope of review is no more res integra. After
survey of the earlier decisions, the Supreme Court in the case of Kamlesh
Verma v. Mayawati and others, AIR 2013 SC 3301 held as follows:
            “15. Review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and
            have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order
            XLVII, Rule 1 of CPC. In review jurisdiction, mere
            disagreement with the view of the judgment cannot be the
            ground for invoking the same. As long as the point is
            already dealt with and answered, the parties are not
            entitled to challenge the impugned judgment in the guise
            that an alternative view is possible under the review
            jurisdiction.
            Summary of the Principles:
            16. Thus, in view of the above, the following grounds of
            review are maintainable as stipulated by the statute:
            (A) When the review will be maintainable:-
            (i) Discovery of new and important matter or evidence
            which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within
            knowledge of the petitioner or could not be produced by
            him;
            (ii) Mistake or error apparent on the face of the record;
            (iii) Any other sufficient reason.
            The words “any other sufficient reason” has been
            interpreted in Chhajju Ram v. Neki, AIR 1922 PC 112 and
            approved by this Court in Moran Mar Basselios Catholicos
            v. Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius & Ors., (1955) 1 SCR
            520 : (AIR 1954 SC 526), to mean “a reason sufficient on
            grounds at least analogous to those specified in the rule”.
            The same principles have been reiterated in Union of India
            v. Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores Ltd. & Ors., JT 2013 (8)
            SC 275 : (2013 AIR SCW 2905).
            (B) When the review will not be maintainable:-
            (i) A repetition of old and overruled argument is not enough
            to reopen concluded adjudications.
            (ii) Minor mistakes of inconsequential import.

                                       4
           (iii) Review proceedings cannot be equated with the original
           hearing of the case.
           (iv) Review is not maintainable unless the material error,
           manifest on the face of the order, undermines its
           soundness or results in miscarriage of justice.
           (v) A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby
           an erroneous decision is re-heard and corrected but lies
           only for patent error.
           (vi) The mere possibility of two views on the subject cannot
           be a ground for review.
           (vii) The error apparent on the face of the record should not
           be an error which has to be fished out and searched.
           (viii) The appreciation of evidence on record is fully within
           the domain of the appellate court, it cannot be permitted to
           be advanced in the review petition.
           (ix) Review is not maintainable when the same relief sought
           at the time of arguing the main matter had been negatived.”
6.         In Sow. Chandra Kanta and another v. Sheik Habib, AIR 1975
SC 1500, the apex Court held:
                   “….. A review of a judgment is a serious step and
           reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring
           omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in
           earlier by judicial fallibility. A mere repetition through
           different counsel of old and overruled arguments, a second
           trip over ineffectually covered ground or minor mistakes of
           inconsequential import are obviously insufficient. The very
           strict need for compliance with these factors is the
           rationale behind the insistence of counsel's certificate
           which should not be a routine affair or a habitual step. It is
           neither fairness to the court which decided nor awareness
           of the precious public time lost what with a huge back-log
           of dockets waiting in the queue for disposal, for counsel to
           issue easy certificates for entertainment of review and fight
           over again the same battle which has been fought and lost.
           The Bench and the Bar, we are sure, are jointly concerned
           in the conservation of judicial time for maximum use. We
           regret to say that this case is typical of the unfortunate but
           frequent phenomenon of repeat performance with the
           review label as passport. Nothing which we did not hear
           then has been heard now, except a couple of rulings on
           points earlier put forward. May be, as counsel now urges
           and then pressed, our order refusing special leave was

                                        5
             capable of a different course. The present stage is not a
             virgin ground but review of an earlier order which has the
             normal feature of finality.”
7.           The Apex Court in the case of Smt.Sawarni Vs. Smt.Inder Kaur
and others, AIR 1996 SC 2823 held that mutation of a property in the
revenue record does not create or extinguish title nor has it any presumptive
value on title. It only enables the person in whose favour mutation is ordered
to pay the land revenue.
8.           Judged on the touchstone of the judicially recognized grounds of
review, this Court is of the opinion that the learned lower appellate court
considered the rival contentions of the parties and affirmed the findings of
the learned trial court. Mere plausibility of different deductions in the same
factual and legal setting would not proprio vigore warrant a review the
decision rendered. Such an eventuality per se does not tantamount to an
error on the face of the record or attest an acknowledged vitiating infirmity to
justify review of a judicial verdict. The review jurisdiction is not akin to one
of appeal. The order of the learned lower appellate court cannot be said to be
perfunctory or flawed warranting interference of this Court under Article 227
of the Constitution.
9.           The petition is dismissed. No costs.
                                                    ………..…………………
                                                      Dr.A.K.Rath, J.
Orissa High Court, Cuttack.
