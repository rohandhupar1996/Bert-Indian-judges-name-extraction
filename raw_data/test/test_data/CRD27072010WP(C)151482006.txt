                 THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE L. MOHAPATRA
                                                        AND
                    THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE C.R. DASH
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Date of Judgment              :      27.07.2010
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.R. Dash, J.               Both the writ petitions are taken up together for disposal,
          as they arise out of the same transaction.
          2.                In both the writ petitions legality of special audit report
          concerning clearance sale-cum-exhibition held during the period from
          16.03.2001 to 11.10.2002 and accounts of its five agency sale depots
          in Calcutta and one at Durgapur covering the period up to 31.03.2004
          is impugned in these writ petitions, both on merit and on
          technicalities.
          3.                During        the    relevant       period       from      23.12.1998         to
          31.08.2003 Sri Gadadhar Parida (petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4353 of
          2006) was the Managing Director of Orissa State Handloom Weavers
          Co-operative Societies Ltd. During the relevant period from
          09.05.2000 to 20.11.2003 Pradipta Kumar Sahani (petitioner in W.P.
          (C) No.15148 of 2006) was the Secretary of the aforesaid Co-
          operative Society. As asserted in both the writ petitions, during the
          period covered under the special audit, movable properties of the
          aforesaid society like damaged clothes and other damaged stock were
          disposed of by clearance-cum-exhibition sale. It is further asserted

                                   3
that such a move was undertaken on the basis of decision of the
Managing Committee of the Society after proper revaluation of the
old and damaged stock. During the incumbency of Sri Gadadhar
Parida (petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4353 of 2006) and Pradipta Kumar
Sahani (petitioner in W.P.(C) No.15148 of 2006) as Managing
Director and Secretary respectively of the aforesaid Society, steps
were also taken to downsize the staffing pattern of the Society for
optimum profit and efficiency of the staff. At the behest of some
dissatisfied staff members, the special audit in question was conducted
without following the procedure prescribed in the Orissa Co-operative
Societies Act, 1962 (‘Act’ for short) and the Rules made thereunder.
It is alleged that the Auditor concerned having not followed the rules
in conducting the audit and having conducted the audit in most
improper manner, the special audit report suffers from gross infirmity,
inherent defects, absurd findings and irrational conclusions.
4.            Mr. Pitambar Acharya, learned counsel for the petitioner
in W.P.(C) No.4353 of 2006, besides assailing the audit report on
merit, submits that the audit has been conducted in gross violation of
Section 62 (1)(iii) of the Act and Rule 58-A of the Rules made
thereunder.
5.            Mr. Pramath Pattnaik, learned counsel for the petitioner
in W.P.(C) No.15148 of 2006 adopts the argument of Mr. Pitambar
Acharya and further submits that the audit report being only a
document containing process of official examination of accounts in
order to make sure that such accounts have been properly maintained,

                                     4
the same cannot be made the basis of further proceeding against the
petitioner.    Mr. Pattnaik relies on the decision of the Hon’ble
Allahabad High Court in the case of Dilip Singh Rana vrs. State of
U.P., 1994 LAB. I.C. 491, to substantiate his contention.
6.            So far as the grounds of challenge of the special audit
report on merit is concerned, we, in exercise of our writ jurisdiction,
do not feel inclined to delve into the merit, inasmuch as examination
of the audit report on merit involves hosts of questions of facts, which
cannot be gone into properly, effectively and efficiently by this Court
in a writ jurisdiction.     So far as the question of admissibility or
otherwise of the audit report in evidence or probative effect thereof
for initiation of Disciplinary Proceeding is concerned, the Writ Court
is not the proper forum to go into such fact. The decision in the case
of Dilip Singh Rana (supra), which relates to finding arrived at in a
Disciplinary Proceeding on the basis of audit report does not apply to
the fact of the present case. In that view of the matter, we propose to
examine the legal points raised by learned counsels for the petitioners
on technicalities, mainly concerning propriety of the audit report on
the ground of contravention of Section 62 of the Act and Rule 58-A of
the Rules made thereunder.
7.            On technicalities, the special audit report has been
impugned on the following grounds -
       (i)    According to Section 62 (1)(iii) of the Act, the special
              audit report in question, which covers a period of three
              years, is not sustainable in the eye of law, as one Auditor

                                    5
             cannot audit the accounts of the same Society for two
             consecutive Co-operative years.
       (ii)   It is the requirement of law that the Auditor should issue
             half-margin memo to the person, against whom recovery
             has been suggested. In the present case, however, no
             half-margin memo has been issued by the Auditor in
             respect of the petitioners in both the writ petitions, and
             such a course by the Auditor is violative of the Rule 58-A
             of the O.C.S. Rules.
             The Auditor-General (O.P.4) has filed counter affidavit
to the effect that initially order was passed for conducting special
audit of accounts of clearance -cum-exhibition sale from 20.05.2001
to 31.10.2001. Subsequently the scope of the audit was expanded
from 16.03.2001 to 11.10.2002 on receipt of complaint to the effect
that there has been misappropriation in selling the stock of the Society
in the sale depots in Calcutta and Durgapur. The scope of the audit
was further expanded to agency sales in five sale depots of the Society
in Calcutta and one sale depot of the Society at Durgapur. It is further
averred in the counter affidavit that the special audit has been
conducted in accordance with Section 62 (1)(ii) of the Act and there
has been no illegality. It has also been averred in the counter affidavit
that on completion of the special audit on all the aforesaid accounts,
the Auditor submitted the special audit report before the deponent
(O.P.4) on 09.05.2005. On receipt of the special audit report, opposite
party no.4 after complying with the requirement of Rule 58-A(2) of
the O.C.S. Rules, communicated the special audit report to opposite

                                      6
party    no.5,    the   Co-operative    Society  concerned   and    other
administrative departments.
8.             In order to appreciate the question of non-compliance of
Section 62(1)(iii) of the Act, it is beneficial to quote the relevant
provisions of the said Section, which reads as follows -
               “62. Audit – (1)(i) The Auditor-General shall audit, or
cause to be audited by an Auditor duly authorized by him in that
behalf, the accounts of every Society for each Co-operative year, and
complete such audit within six months of the closure of the year, at
least once or for such number of times as may be directed by the State
Government from time to time in respect of any Society or class of
Societies.
               (ii) The Auditor-General may, of his own motion or on
                      a requisition from the Registrar and shall, on a
                      directive from the State Government, arrange for
                      special audit, re-audit or concurrent audit of the
                      accounts of any Society or class of Societies or
                      day-to-day or such other basis as may be directed.
               (iii) The Auditor-General shall so arrange the audit that
                      the same Auditor shall not audit the accounts of
                      the same Society for two consecutive Co-operative
                      years.”
               A cursory reading of the aforesaid provisions makes it
clear that provision of Section 62(1)(ii) applies to special audit and it
has also been asserted by the Auditor-General (O.P.4) in his counter
affidavit that the special audit was conducted in accordance with
Section 62 (1)(ii) of the Act. Sub-sections (1)(i) and (iii) of Section
62 applies to normal / general or annual audit of a co-operative society
conducted in each co-operative year. Sub-section (1)(iii) of section 62
is in the nature of a dictum to the Auditor General to arrange the audit

                                    7
in such a manner that the same Auditor shall not audit the accounts of
the same Society for two consecutive co-operative years. Provisions
contained in sub-sections (1)(i) and (1)(iii) of Section 62 make it
undoubtedly clear that both the provisions apply to annual audit of a
co-operative society. Sub-section (1)(ii), however, applies to special
audit, re-audit or concurrent audit of the accounts of any Society or
class of Societies on day-to-day basis or such other basis as may be
directed.
9.           In the present case, irregularities relating to transactions
in a particular event have been audited.       That particular event is
exhibition-cum-clearance sale of damaged old clothes and other
immovables. Such event spreads within the period audited in course
of the special audit.     The special audit being concerned with a
particular event, such event on the basis of co-operative years could
not have been fragmented or separated for audit by different auditors.
Rightly, therefore, same auditor has conducted the special audit in
respect of the events in question and such a course in case of special
audit is required to be followed to maintain uniformity of the auditing
process. Regard being had to the provisions contained in Section 62
of the Act in its entirety, we are not in a position to accept the
contention of learned counsel for the petitioners in both the writ
applications that sub-section (1)(iii) of Section 62 applies even to a
special audit and there being contravention of the said provision, the
entire audit report is vitiated. This contention, therefore, merits no
consideration and must fail.

                                     8
10.          Coming to the second contention regarding non
compliance of Rule 58-A of the Rules, it is submitted that though the
Auditor conducting audit was required to issue half-margin memos/
objection memos for compliance, no such half-margin memos having
been issued to the petitioners, the entire audit report is vitiated.
11.          So far as this ground is concerned, learned counsels for
the petitioners in both the writ petitions rely heavily on the proviso 2
to Rule 58-A(1) of the Rules, which reads as follows –
             “Provided further that every Auditor conducting
             audit on behalf of the Auditor-General shall
             forthwith endorse copies of all objection memos
             and compliance received thereto, as and when filed
             with, or received from the society along with his
             finding, if any, thereon, to the Auditor-General,
             who shall take those into account for giving such
             directions to the society as he may deem proper.”
             The aforesaid provisions, as clearly understood, relates to
endorsement of the copies of all the objection memos by the Auditor
conducting audit to the society and forwarding of the compliance
received from the society along with his finding to the Auditor
General so that the Auditor General shall be in a position to give
proper direction to the society audited. There is nothing in the proviso
to suggest that any findings adverse to any individual in his capacity
as Office Bearer of the Society concerned should be endorsed to that
particular person for his view / reply or explanation on the findings of
the Auditor. The Auditor-General (O.P.4) in his counter affidavit has
clearly averred that Rule 58-A of the O.C.S. Rules has been complied

                                             9
        with. In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to accept the
        aforesaid contention of learned counsels for the petitioners in both the
        writ applications.
        12.           Before parting with the order, we feel inclined to observe
        here that the petitioners in both the writ applications are anxious about
        the prospective disciplinary action against them on the basis of the
        special audit report in question and, in order to wriggle out of such
        action or apprehending such action, the petitioners have called in
        question legality of the special audit report, which may become the
        very basis of such apprehended action.
        13.           Regard being had to the nature of the special audit
        conducted and duties asserted to be discharged by the petitioners in
        their official capacities, we feel inclined to observe here that wisdom
        of the auditor in the special audit report should not be made the basis
        of any disciplinary action against the petitioners without affording
        them proper opportunity to explain their conduct.
                      With the aforesaid observation, both the writ petitions are
        dismissed.
