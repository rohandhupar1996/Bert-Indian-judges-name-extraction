                  THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
      Date of hearing:     02.04.2014        :    Date of judgment:       23.04.2014
Dr. A.K.Rath, J            In  this   application     under     Article  226   of  the
      Constitution of India, the petitioners, who are land oustees, challenge
      the notification published under Section 4(1) and declaration under
      Section 6(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to
      as “the Act”) respectively for acquisition of Ac.1188.41 of land of village
      Darlipali under Lefripada Tahasil in the district of Sundargarh for
      construction of Super Thermal Power Project of National Thermal
      Power Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “the NTPC”), as illegal,
      non est and void.

                                     2
2.           Bereft of unnecessary details, the short facts of the case of
the petitioners are that the Government of Orissa in its Revenue &
Disaster Management Department issued a notification under Section
4(1) of the Act on 10.3.2010 for acquisition of Ac.1188.41 of land for
construction of Super Thermal Power Project of NTPC. Petitioner No.1
through    his  lawyer   collected  information   under   the   Right   to
Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as “the RTI Act”)
regarding notification published under Section 4(1) of the Act in the
Orissa Gazette. As per letter No.16348 dated 9.4.2012, the Joint
Secretary to Government informed that no notification bearing
No.LA(C) 189/2010 (Sundargarh) 10675/RDM dtd.10.3.2010 has been
published in the Orissa Gazette. It is further stated that as per
Constitution Order 109 - Scheduled Areas (States of Bihar, Gujarat,
Madhya Pradesh and Orissa) Order, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as
“the Scheduled Order”) dtd. 31.12.1977, Sundargarh District in the
State of Orissa comes under scheduled areas. Village Darlipali and
Raidihi under Lefripada Tahasil is within the Sundargarh district. The
Sarpanch, Darlipali Gram Panchayat issued notice on 10.11.2010 to
all voters of Darlipali Gram Panchayat for holding a general Gram
Sabha on 24.11.2010 at 11 A.M regarding land acquisition for NTPC
Thermal Power Project. On 24.11.2010, the Gram Sabha was
adjourned due to want of quorum. On 26.11.2010, another notice was
issued by the Sarpanch, Darlipali to hold Gram Sabha on 28.11.2010.
It is stated that in the notice the date is over written as 25.11.2010,
whereas the Sarpanch signed the notice on 26.11.2010. Since the
resolution dated 28.11.2010 of the Gram Sabha was made without
proper notice, the same is void and non est. It is further stated that by
letter no.610 dated 26.5.2011, the Public Information Officer-cum-
District Panchayat Officer, Sundargarh (hereinafter referred to as “the
PIO”) informed the petitioner no.1 that the adjourned Gram Sabha held
on 28.11.2010 is illegal. But then, by another letter no.639 dated
31.5.2011, the PIO intimated that there is some clerical error in the

                                     3
information supplied to the petitioner no.1 in his earlier letter and sent
the revised information along with the said letter. As per letter no.1219
dated 10.10.2011, the PIO submitted inquiry report dated 7.10.2011 to
the Collector, Sundargarh. In the said report, he categorically stated
that the Gram Sabha held on 28.11.2010 cannot be treated as a Gram
Sabha under the Orissa Gram Panchayats Act and Rules. Further case
of the petitioners is that as per Section 4(1) of the Act, the Government
have not issued the advertisement No.VII-77 dtd. 10.3.2010 in Utkal
Mail published on 8.4.2011 from Rourkela. The advertisement is a fake
one. No notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was published in the
newspaper. When the villagers objected to the public hearing before
issuance of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, the NTPC officials
distributed the fake Utkal Mail Oriya Newspaper on 8.4.2011 with fake
notification. Thereafter, they filed WP(C) No.23841 of 2011 before this
Court. In the said case, notice had been issued to the opposite parties.
But then, the petitioners along with others submitted objection under
Section 5A(1) of the Act before the Collector, Sundargarh. The Collector
did not consider the point raised by them. Furthermore, declaration
under Section 6(1) of the Act was issued on 29.2.2012, i.e., after lapse
of one year. In view of the same, the declaration under Section 6(1) of
the Act is also void and non est.
3.            Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has
been filed by opposite parties 4 and 7. The case of the opposite parties
is that NTPC is a Government of India enterprise. It had submitted
proposal for acquisition of Ac.1188.41 of land in village Darlipali of
Lefripada Tahasil in Sundargarh district for establishment of Super
Thermal Power Project. The preliminary notification under Section 4(1)
of the Act was issued by the Government in its Revenue & Disaster
Management Department on 10.3.2011 vide no.10775 for acquisition
of Ac.1188.41 of land. Due to typographical error, the date had been
typed as “10.3.2010” instead of “10.3.2011”. But subsequently, the
date had been corrected and the correct notification had been issued.

                                    4
Preliminary notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was published in
the   Orissa   Gazette   (Extraordinary)  vide  Gazette  No.603    dated
24.3.2011. The same was also published in two Oriya dailies, i.e, “the
Utkal Mail” and “Prajatantra” on 8.4.2011 and 7.4.2011 respectively. It
is further stated that Sundergarh District comes under the scheduled
areas. Due procedure has been followed to consult the Gram Sabha as
per the provisions contained in the Panchayats (Extension to the
Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as “the PESA Act”).
The actual planning and implementation on rehabilitation and
resettlement matter had been done as per the provisions contained in
Orissa Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy – 2006 (hereinafter
referred to as “the ORRP – 2006”). As per the provisions contained in
the PESA Act, the Sarpanch, Darlipali was requested to consult the
Gram Sabha for the purpose. Accordingly, the Sarpanch in his letter
no.425 dated 12.4.2010 intimated all concerned to attend the meeting.
On receipt of a copy of the letter of the Sarpanch, the Collector,
Sundargarh authorised the Project Administrator, Integrated Tribal
Development Agency, Sundargarh, to remain present in the Gram
Sabha. The Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha), Sundargarh, officials of
NTPC, other officers, like, Sub-Collector, Sundergarh, Land Acquisition
Officer, Sundergarh, Additional Block Development Officer, Lefripada
were also present in the Gram Sabha. The Gram Sabha was conducted
as per Section 4(c) of the PESA Act. PESA Act does not contain any
specific period for convening the same. The provisions contained in the
Orissa Gram Panchayats Rules, 1968 (hereinafter referred to as “the
OGP Rules”) have no application in the instant case. In the Gram
Sabha held on 24.4.2010, detailed discussion on acquisition of land,
rehabilitation and resettlement of the land oustees including the eleven
point demands was made. The resolution was read out and
unanimously adopted by the villagers, but at the end of the meeting no
written resolution could be passed since few villagers did not put their
signatures in the resolution register. Thereafter, the Sarpanch

                                    5
convened another Gram Sabha on 24.11.2010, but the same was
adjourned due to want of quorum. Again, the Sarpanch held a Gram
Sabha on 28.11.2010. The villagers reiterated the eleven point
demands and agreed for land acquisition subject to fulfilment of
charter of demands. They never raised any objection for establishment
of NTPC Thermal Power Plant in the village. Further case of the
opposite parties is that the notification dated 8.4.2011 published in
the Utkal Mail is not a fake one. On receipt of memo no.10777 dated
10.3.2011 of the Government of Orissa in the Revenue & Disaster
Management Department, the Government in Information and Public
Relation Department sent order to the Advertisement Manager, Utkal
Mail,   Rourkela   to   publish   the  notification.   Since  there    was
typographical error showing the date of Government notification as
“10.3.2010” instead of “10.3.2011”, the notification was published in
the Utkal Mail mentioning the date as “10.3.2010”. Out of total land
acquired in villages Darlipali and Raidihi, Khata No.168 of village
Darlipali is recorded in the name of Gourisankar Naik, father of
petitioner no.1. He had received an amount of Rs.2,69,20,000.00
towards compensation and ex gratia @ Rs.20,00,000.00 per acre on
31.1.2013. All the petitioners, except petitioner no.5, had received their
compensation     amount    without    any    protest.  The   payment     of
compensation to the petitioner no.5 was held up in view of the fact that
this Court has passed an order of stay in WP(C) No.348 of 2013.
Furthermore, 66.4% compensation of village Darlipali had been
disbursed. It is further stated that the Collector, Sundargarh on an
enquiry under Section 5A of the Act was convinced that the majority of
the villagers are in favour of establishment of the Project. Thereafter,
declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act was made.
4.           Opposite   party   no.5   has    filed  a  counter   affidavit
contending, inter alia, that the date “10.3.2010” appearing in the
notification under Section 4(1) of the Act is a typographical mistake.
The same is “10.3.2011”. The notification was published in the Orissa

                                      6
Gazette No.603 dated 24.3.2011, vide Annexure-F/7. The substance of
the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was published in the
locality on 25.3.2011 in the presence of five witnesses, vide Annexure
G/7. Thereafter, the notification was published in the local dailies,
“Prajatantra” and “the Utkal Mail” on 7.4.2011 and 8.4.2011, vide
Annexures H/7 and I/7 respectively. The minor discrepancy does not
vitiate the land acquisition process. Furthermore, pursuant to the
notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, several objections were
received within the statutory period of thirty days. The objectors did
not raise any grievance relating to acquisition of their land. They
demanded       compensation      amount,     employment,     rehabilitation,
provision for free medical facilities, establishment of medical college,
engineering college and hospital, acquisition of entire lands instead of
part thereof. They also demanded free electricity and water. Except
petitioner no.1, none of the petitioners had made any objection within
the statutory period. Petitioner no.1 had also not raised any grievance
relating to acquisition of the land, save and except, to fulfil the
demands. It is further stated that on 27.10.2011, petitioner nos.1 and
5 submitted another representation before the Collector, Sundargarh,
mentioning eleven point demands wherein they had admitted about
the publication of the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act in the
Utkal Mail Rourkela edition dated 8.4.2011, vide Annexure I/7 series.
The Collector, Sundargarh afforded opportunity of hearing to the
objectors. After making thorough enquiry, she submitted a report on
27.10.2011 along with the records of the proceeding stating therein
that she was fully convinced that majority of the villagers were in
favour of establishment of the project provided their demands were
fulfilled. So far as Section 6(1) of the Act is concerned, it is stated that
after considering the report of the Collector, the declaration under
Section 6(1) of the Act was made by the State Government on
29.2.2012, vide Annexure M/7. The substance of the declaration was
published in the concerned locality on 2.3.2012 in the presence of

                                     7
witnesses, vide Annexure N/7. The same was published in the Orissa
Gazette, vide Annexure O/7. The declaration was also published in the
two local daily newspapers, i.e., “Kalingabharati” and “Prajatantra” on
21.3.2012 and 23.3.2012, vide Annexures P/7 and Q/7, respectively.
It is further stated that the award under Section 11 of the Act was
passed on 8.12.2012 in respect of 1159 awardees. Thereafter, 1058
number of awardees had received the compensation. The father of
petitioner no.1 received the compensation of Rs.2,71,60,000/- on
30.1.2013 without any protest. Petitioner nos.2 to 4 and 6 had also
received compensation without protest. Compensation could not be
paid to petitioner no.5 in view of pendency of the case before the court.
It is further stated that on 18.3.2013 possession of the acquired lands
were taken over.
5.            A counter affidavit has been filed by the District Panchayat
Officer, Sundargarh, opposite party no.6, wherein it is stated that the
petitioners were supplied with information under the RTI Act on
26.5.2011, but, subsequently, it was detected that there was some
clerical error in supplying the information. The records of the Gram
Panchayat were not available in the District Panchayat Office,
Sundargarh and, as such, revised information was supplied to the
petitioners on 31.5.2011. It is further stated that there is no provision
under the PESA Act to give fifteen days notice for convening the Gram
Sabha.
6.            Opposite party no.8 also filed a counter affidavit taking the
similar stand to that of opposite parties 4 and 7. The specific case of
opposite party no.8 is that notification under Section 4(1) of the Act
had been acted upon. Objections had been filed by the persons
interested. Their objections were heard and disposed of. None of the
persons affected in the village approached this Court for quashing of
the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. The land acquisition is
for public purpose. Furthermore, NTPC Ltd. is a Government Company
and its purpose is to set up the power plant of 1600 MW to cater the

                                     8
needs of people of State of Orissa for a greater public interest. It is
further stated that the villagers are in favour of acquisition of their
land. None of the affected persons have ever raised any objection under
Section 5A of the Act. Furthermore, the father of petitioner no.1, in
whose name the entire property stands in the ROR, has received the
compensation. Petitioner nos.2 to 4 and 6 have also received
compensation. So far as petitioner no.5 is concerned, he had not
received the compensation because of objection raised by his family
members and the matter is pending before the Land Acquisition
Collector.
7.           In the rejoinder affidavit, the petitioners have controverted
the submissions made by opposite parties 4 and 7 in the counter
affidavits.
8.           We have heard Mr.N.C.Panigrahi, learned Senior Advocate
for the petitioners, Mr.R.K.Mohapatra, learned Government Advocate
and Mr.P.K.Muduli, learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the State of
Orissa, Mr.R.K.Rath, learned Senior Advocate and Mr.B.S.Tripathy,
learned Advocate for opposite party no.8.
9.           Mr.Panigrahi, learned Senior Advocate, submitted that
Section 4(1) of the Act mandates that the notification shall be
published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers circulated
in the locality, of which at least one shall be in the regional language.
Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of M/s.V.K.M
Kattha Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana and others, AIR 2013
SC 3557, he submitted that the publication of all the notifications as
provided under Section 4 of the Act are mandatory and unless all the
three publications are complete, the notification must be deemed to be
void. He further submitted that as per the information obtained under
the RTI Act dated 27.10.2011, the Public Relation Officer has supplied
copy of the Utkal Mail edition dated 8.4.2011 published from Rourkela.
The same shows that the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was
never published in the said edition. There is only one edition of Utkal

                                     9
Mail published from Rourkela. Furthermore, the copies of paper
publications filed by NTPC as well as State Government would show
that the publications are partly in English and partly in Oriya. The
land schedule has been published in English, which prejudices the
illiterate land oustees. The year, date of publication, the words of
notification and the number of notification also do not match. He
further submitted that the State cannot take a stand that there is a
mistake in the date of the notification. Had it been so, the Government
would have issued a corrigendum. But then, no such corrigendum has
been issued. Referring to Annexure-5, Mr.Panigrahi submitted that the
Joint Secretary to Government, Revenue & Disaster Management
Department had informed that no notification bearing No.LA(C)
189/2010 (Sundergarh) 10675/RDM dated 10.3.2010 had been
published in the Orissa Gazette. But from the copy of the newspaper
publication dated 8.4.2011, it is evident that the very same notification
with change of year and number had been published. Though the
notification was actually intended to be published in the year 2010, yet
the same was not gazetted. On the other hand, it was published in the
newspaper on 8.4.2011 without being gazetted. The villagers in
Rehabilitation   and   Peripheral   Development    Advisory   Committee
(RPDAC) meeting raised the question of non-publication of the
notification in the local daily to which the Revenue Divisional
Commissioner and the Collector pleaded their ignorance. He further
submitted that the declaration under Section 6(1) is illegal in view of
the fact that the same was published after one year of the alleged
publication of the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. Placing
reliance on the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Nazir
Ahmad v. King-Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253 (2), he submitted that
where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing
must be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of performance
are necessarily forbidden. Since the notification published under
Section 4(1) and declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act are contrary

                                     10
to the spirit of the statute, are liable to be quashed. Mr.Panigrahi
further submitted that in Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius
Shapur Chenai and others, (2005) 7 SCC 627, the Supreme Court in
paragraph-19 of the report held that the State is required to apply its
mind not only on the objections filed by the owner of the land; but also
on the report submitted by the Collector upon making further
enquiries therefor so also the recommendations made by him in that
behalf. The State Government may further inquire into the matter, if
any case is made out therefor, for arriving at its own satisfaction that it
is necessary to deprive a citizen of his right to property. He placed
reliance on the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Surinder
Singh Brar and others v. Union of India and others, (2013) 1 SCC 403
and Usha Stud and Agricultural Farms Private Limited and others v.
State of Haryana and others, (2013) 4 SCC 2010. He further
submitted that the mandatory provision of PESA Act has not been
followed while convening the Gram Sabha. So far as acceptance of
compensation is concerned, relying on the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Ashwani Kumar Dhingra v. State of Punjab, AIR
1992 SC 974, he submitted that one co-owner may challenge the
acquisition, whereas the other co-owner may be satisfied with the
acquisition and ask for compensation. He further submitted that the
petitioner no.1 has not received any compensation. Petitioner no.1 is a
member of the undivided family consisting of father and other
brothers. Merely because his father has received the compensation,
that does not preclude him from challenging the notification. So far as
petitioner nos.2 to 4 and 6 are concerned, they have received the
compensation with protest and that does not deprive them to challenge
the notification, since there is no estoppel against statute.
10.          Mr.R.K.Mohapatra, learned Government Advocate, argued
with vehemence that notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was
issued on 10.3.2011, whereas the present writ application was filed on
7.9.2012. Relying on the decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the

                                     11
cases of Chairman & MD. BPL Ltd. v. S.P. Gururaja and others, (2003) 8
SCC 567, Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited
v. Chinthamaneni Narasimha Rao and others, (2012) 12 SCC 797,
Aflatoon and others v. Lt. Governor of Delhi and others, (1975) 4 SCC
285 and Hari Singh and others v. State of U.P and others, (1984) 2 SCC
624, he submitted that if the landowners are really aggrieved by the
acquisition proceedings, they must challenge the same at least before
an award is made and the possession of the land in question is taken
by the Government authorities. He submitted that when the award was
passed and possession was taken, the court should not have exercised
its power to quash the award which is a material factor to be taken
into consideration before exercising the power under Article 226. He
further submitted that the writ application is liable to be dismissed
due to laches on the part of the petitioners. He submitted that the
defects in the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act are not
fatal. No prejudice has been caused to any of the petitioners. Since the
petitioners had not raised any objection under Section 5A of the Act
with regard to wrong date of notification, wrong L.A Case number,
wrong notification number, differences in the name of signatory and
publication of the land schedule in English language, they are
estopped from raising such questions for the first time before this
Court. Rather the petitioners in their objections had stated about the
correct notification number and date of publication. Mere defects will
not invalidate the notification; particularly when the purpose of the
land acquisition is not changed. The petitioners are the fence-sitters.
They allowed the Government to complete the acquisition proceeding
on the basis of the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act and
declaration made under Section 6 of the Act. All petitioners have
received the awarded amount except petitioner no.5. Mr.Mohapatra
further submitted that in the objection dated 27.10.2011 filed by the
objectors including petitioner nos.1 to 5, they had mentioned about the
correct notification number, i.e., 10775 as well as the correct

                                     12
notification date, i.e. 10.3.2011. But while seeking information under
the RTI Act on 23.3.2012, vide Annexure-4, the petitioners sought the
wrong information with regard to notification No.LA(C) 189/2010
(Sundargarh) : 10675/RDM dtd. 10.3.2010 of the Government in the
Revenue & Disaster Management Department published in the Orissa
Gazette. Accordingly, the information was supplied on 9.4.2012, vide
Annexure-5,     that    no  notification  bearing   no.LA(C)   189/2010
(Sundargarh) : 10675/RDM, dtd.10.03.2010 had been published in the
Orissa Gazette by the Revenue & Disaster Management Department as
by that time, the L.A case number, notification number and the
notification date had already been corrected and notification under
Section 4(1) of the Act had been published in the Gazette on 24.3.2011
as would be evident from Annexure F/7 of the additional affidavit
dated 26.2.2014. Pursuant to the same, petitioner nos.1 to 5 had
submitted their objection dated 27.10.2011, vide Annexure-16, by
mentioning the date as “10.3.2011”. Therefore, the petitioners cannot
be permitted to blow hot and cold at the same breath. The enquiry
report dated 27.10.2011 of the Collector, vide Annexure-17, would
show that the Collector had taken into consideration 790 objections.
Individual notices were issued to the objectors. A notice was also
served in the concerned village. Thus, on the facts and circumstances
of the case, full opportunity was afforded to the objectors by the
Collector. Furthermore, the State authorities had complied with the
provisions of the PESA Act. The Gram Sabha was held prior to the
publication of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. The provisions
of the OGP Act and Rules framed thereunder have no application with
regard to consultation and holding of Gram Sabha under the
provisions of the PESA Act. He further submitted that the majority of
the land losers having accepted the compensation and not challenged
the land acquisition proceeding, challenge thereto by minuscule land
losers is not maintainable and liable to be dismissed.

                                      13
11.          Mr.R.K.Rath,     learned    Senior    Advocate,    adopted the
submissions      advanced    by    Mr.Mohapatra,      learned    Government
Advocate. Mr.Rath submitted that all the statutory requirements of the
Act have been sacrosantly complied with for acquisition of land for
NTPC. There is no challenge to the notification under Section 4(1) of
the Act, the declaration under Section 6, notice under Section 9 or
award passed under Section 11 of the Act immediately after their
publication by the petitioners. There is also no challenge at all to the
land acquisition proceedings in question by the affected land owners,
save and except, six petitioners out of which four have received the
compensation without protest. The land acquisition proceedings are
almost over. He submitted that since majority of the land owners do
not object to the acquisition, the writ application is liable to be
dismissed. He placed reliance on the decisions of the Supreme Court in
the cases of Nand Kishore Gupta & others v. State of U.P & others, AIR
2010 SC 3654, Girias Investment Private Limited and another v. State
of Karnataka & others, (2008) 7 SCC 53, Ramniklal N. Bhutta and
another v. State of Maharashtra and others, (1997) 1 SCC 134,
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. The Industrial Development
Investmetn Co. Pvt. Ltd. and others, (1996) 11 SCC 501, Swaika
Properties (P) Ltd. and another v. State of Rajasthan and other, (2008) 4
SCC 695 and Reliance Petroleum Ltd. V. Zaver Chand Popatlal Sumaria
and others, (1996) 4 SCC 579.
12.          From the pleadings and the submissions made at the Bar,
the following points have emerged for consideration;
             “1. Whether there is valid publication of notification
             under Section 4(1) of the Act in the Orissa Gazette and in
             two daily newspapers circulated in that locality ?
             2. Whether the defects in the notification vitiate the
             entire land acquisition proceeding?
             3. Whether the provisions of OGP Act and Rules framed
             thereunder or PESA Act, 1996 are applicable to the
             scheduled areas?

                                       14
             4. Whether there is any valid Gram Sabha prior to
             publication of the notification under Section 4(1) of the
             Act?
             5. Whether the Collector has considered the objection
             filed by the land oustees under Section 5A of the Act in
             its proper perspective?
             6. Whether declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act has
             been published after one year of publication of
             notification under Section 4(1) of the Act?
             7. Whether the writ application is maintainable by
             minuscule land outstees, moreso when four petitioners
             out of six have received the compensation without
             protest?
             8. Whether there is a gross delay and laches on the part
             of the petitioners in approaching this Court ?
             9. And to what relief?”
13.          Point Nos.1 and 2 :
             In the counter affidavit, a specific stand has been taken by
the opposite parties 4 & 7 and 5 that in fact notification under Section
4(1) of the Act was issued on 10.3.2011. Due to typographical error,
the date has been typed as “10.3.2010” instead of “10.3.2011”. The
preliminary notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was published in
the   Orissa    Gazette    (Extraordinary)   vide   Gazette  No.603    dated
24.3.2011 and the same was published in two local dailies, “The Utkal
Mail” and “Prajatantra” on 8.4.2011 and 7.4.2011, vide Annexures B/7
and C/7, respectively. From the Gazette, vide Annexure A/7, it is
evident that the date of notification was “10.3.2011”. But then, the
notifications published in the local dailies, vide Annexures B/7 and
C/7, indicate the date as “10.3.2010”. In respect of letter no.10775
mentioned in the notification, the same has been mentioned as
“10675” in the newspaper.
14.          We have carefully and meticulously perused the Gazette
and the notifications published in the local dailies. Except the
aforementioned two minor discrepancies, the khata number, plot
number and area mentioned in the land schedule have been correctly
described. In our considered opinion, these two minor discrepancies do

                                     15
not vitiate the land acquisition process; when there is no discrepancy
in the description of land. Needless to mention here that except
petitioner no.1, none had filed objection before the Collector under
Section 5A of the Act. In the objection filed by petitioner no.1, he had
not raised any objection relating to acquisition of land, save and
except, to fulfil the demand. We fail to understand as to how petitioner
no.1 filed an objection under Section 5A of the Act when the
notification was not published in the local daily. It is also evident from
the counter affidavit filed by opposite party no.5 that the substance of
the notification was also published in the locality on 25.3.2011 in
presence of five witnesses, vide Annexure G/7.
15.          In view of the same, we hold that the notification under
Section 4(1) of the Act was published in the Orissa Gazette
(Extraordinary) vide Gazette No.603 dated 24.3.2011 and two local
dailies, “Prajatantra” and “the Utkal Mail” on 7.4.2011 and 8.4.2011,
vide Annexures H/7 and I/7 respectively. We further hold that the
minor discrepancies in the said notification do not vitiate the land
acquisition process when the khata number, plot number and area
mentioned in the land schedule have been correctly described in the
Gazette as well as in the newspapers.
16.          Point Nos.3 and 4:
             Relying on Rule 6(1) of the OGP Rules, Mr.Panigrahi
submitted that since fifteen clear days notice was not issued by the
Sarpanch for holding Gram Sabha, the resolution dated 28.11.2010 is
void in the eye of law. The PESA Act was enacted by Parliament to
provide for the extension of the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution
relating to the Panchayats to the scheduled areas. The village Darlipali
under Lefripada Tahasil in the district of Sundargarh comes under the
scheduled areas enumerated in the Scheduled Order. Section 4(i) of
the PESA Act provides as follows:
                     “4. Exceptions and modifications to Part IX of
             the Constitution - Notwithstanding anything contained
             under Part IX of the Constitution, the Legislature of a

                                       16
              State shall not make any law under that Part which is
              inconsistent with any of the following features, namely:-
                 (i)   the Gram Sabha or the Panchayats at the
                     appropriate level shall be consulted before
                     making the acquisition of land in the Scheduled
                     Areas for development projects and before
                     re-settling or rehabilitating persons affected by
                     such projects in the Scheduled Areas; the actual
                     planning and implementation of the projects in
                     the Scheduled Areas shall be coordinated at the
                     State level;
              Section 5 of the Orissa Grama Panchayat Act, 1964
(hereinafter referred to as “the OGP Act”) provides for Grama Sabha
and its functions. Sub-section (1) of Section 5 provides that there shall
be at least two meetings one in February and the other in June every
year of the members of the Grama Sasan and such other meetings as
may be prescribed. Sub-section (3) of Section 5 provides that the
Grama Sasan shall have the power to discuss and deliberate the
matters enumerated in Clauses (a) to (h) of the Act. Rule 6(i) of the
OGP Rules provides that at least fifteen clear days’ notice of a meeting
of Grama Sabha shall be given. Fifteen clear days’ notice provided
under Rule 6(i) of the OGP Rules is to hold Gram Sabha to discuss and
deliberate the matters enumerated in Clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section
(3) of Section 5 of the OGP Act. So far as scheduled areas are
concerned, the Gram Sabha, for acquisition of land, is conducted as
per Section 4(c) of the PESA Act. The PESA Act does not prescribe any
procedure for convening the Grama Sabha.
17.           From the counter affidavit, it is evident that as per the
provision of the PESA Act, the Sarpanch, Darlipali Gram Panchayat
was requested to consult the Gram Sabha. Thereafter, by letter no.425
dated 12.4.2010, the Sarpanch intimated all concerned to attend the
meeting. On receipt of a copy of the letter of the Sarpanch, the
Collector, Sundargarh authorised the Project Administrator, Integrated
Tribal Development Agency, Sundargarh to remain present in the
Gram Sabha. The Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha), Sundargarh,
officials of NTPC, other officers like Sub-Collector, Sundergarh, Land

                                     17
Acquisition Officer, Sundergarh, Additional Block Development Officer,
Lefripada were also present in the Gram Sabha. In the Gram Sabha
held on 24.4.2010, a detailed discussion on acquisition of land and
rehabilitation and resettlement matter including the eleven points of
demands were made. The resolution was read out and unanimously
adopted by the villagers. But at the end of the meeting no written
resolution could be passed as a few villagers did not put their
signatures in the resolution register. Thereafter, the Sarpanch
convened another Gram Sabha on 24.11.2010, but the same was
adjourned due to want of quorum. Again, the Sarpanch held a Gram
Sabha on 28.11.2010. In the Gram Sabha, none of the villagers raised
any objection pertaining to establishment of thermal power plant in the
village, but they made eleven point demands.
              In view of the analysis made above, we hold that there was
a valid Gram Sabha, wherein the resolution was passed for acquisition
of the land.
18.           Point No.5 :
              We have gone through the report dated 27.10.2011 of the
Collector, Sundargarh, vide Annexure-17. As would be evident from
the said report, notices were served on the villagers. General notice
was also served on the village. In the hearing, the villagers raised
sixteen demands. The Collector came to a categorical conclusion that
she was fully convinced that majority of the villagers were in favour of
establishment of the project provided their demands were taken care
of.   Thereafter, the said report was submitted to the Government.
Thus, we hold that the Collector, Sundargarh had considered the
objection filed by the land oustees under Section 5A of the Act in its
proper perspective. The decision of M/s. V.K.M Kattha Industries Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) is distinguishable in the facts and circumstances of the
present case. In the said case, a contention was raised that since the
notification was not published in the conspicuous places of the locality
concerned, neither the lessee of the appellant company nor the

                                     18
appellant company came to know about the same and, as such, the
appellant company was deprived of valuable right to file objection
under Section 5A of the Act. In para-15, their Lordship held that there
was no whisper about the publication of the substance of the
notification in the locality as provided under Section 4(1) of the Act.
Having held so, their Lordship allowed the appeal and quashed the
land acquisition proceedings so far as appellant company is concerned.
But the same is not the case here. The specific plea taken by the
Government that the substance of the notification under Section 4(1)
of the Act was published in the locality on 25.3.2011 in the presence of
five witnesses, has not been controverted by the petitioners.
19.           Point No.6 :
              We have scrutinised the notification issued under Sections
4(1) and declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act. Declaration under
Section 6(1) of the Act was published within one year of the publication
of the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. Thus, the said issue is
answered against the petitioners.
20.           Point Nos.7, 8 and 9 :
              In Chairman & MD. BPL Ltd. (supra), the respondents filed
a public interest litigation questioning the allotment of land to the BPL
Ltd. on the ground that the statutory purposes for which the
Karnataka Industrial Development Board can acquire the land had
been breached.     The writ application having been allowed, BPL Ltd.
filed an appeal before the Supreme Court. In course of hearing, it was
pointed out that the lands were allotted on 7.4.1995. The writ petition
was filed on 11.11.1996 and, as such, suffered from gross delay and
laches. In para-32 of the report, their Lordship held that the High
Court committed a manifest error in so far as it failed to take into
consideration that the delay in the case had defeated equity.
              In Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation
Ltd. (supra), notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was issued on
27.8.1993 for acquisition of land. Looking into the urgency under the

                                   19
provisions of Section 17 of the Act, an inquiry under Section 5A of the
Act was dispensed with. Thereafter, the notification with regard to the
declaration under Section 6 of the Act was published on 8.10.1993.
Writ Petition No.5036 of 1994 was filed on 18.9.1995 before the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging the validity of the proceedings on
various grounds. The writ petition having been dismissed, the
petitioners filed Writ Appeal No.1337 of 1999. By order dated
23.7.2001, a Division Bench of the High Court quashed the order
dated 27.8.1999 passed by the learned Single Judge. Being aggrieved
by the said judgment and order, the appellant filed a review petition,
which came to be dismissed. Thereafter, the appellant filed appeals
before the Supreme Court. In para-13 of the report, it is held that if the
landowners are aggrieved by the acquisition proceedings, they must
challenge the same at least before an award is made and the
possession of the land in question is taken by the government
authorities. Relying on Swaika Properties (P) Ltd. (supra), it is held that
when there is inordinate delay in filing the writ petition and when all
steps taken in the acquisition proceedings have become final, the court
should be loath to quash the notifications. It is further held that the
High Court has, no doubt, discretionary powers under Article 226 of
the Constitution to quash the notification under Section 4(1) and
declaration under Section 6. But it should be exercised taking all
relevant factors into pragmatic consideration. When the award was
passed and possession was taken, the court should not have exercised
its power to quash the award which is a material factor to be taken
into consideration before exercising the power under Article 226.
             In State of Orissa v. Dhobei Sethi, (1995) 5 SCC 583, it
was held that on account of laches on the part of the petitioners, the
writ petition was liable to be dismissed. It was further held that the
High Court, was, therefore, unjustified in issuing the writ and
quashing the notification and declaration under Sections 4(1) and 6 of
the Act respectively.

                                           20
      21.           In the instant case, the petitioners have missed the bus by
      adopting    the   indolent   attitude   in   challenging   the  acquisition
      notification promptly. Majority of the land owners do not object to the
      acquisition. The subject-matter of dispute only relates to acquisition of
      few acres of land as compared to the acquisition of large chunk, which
      has not been challenged. It is an admitted position that the majority of
      the acquisition proceedings are over. Out of six petitioners, petitioner
      nos.2 to 4 and 6 have received the compensation. The compensation
      could not be paid to petitioner no.5 in view of the pendency of the case
      in the court. So far as petitioner no.1 is concerned, he filed an
      objection under Section 5A of the Act before the Collector. He did not
      raise any objection pertaining to the acquisition of the land.
      Furthermore, he is a member of the RPDAC Committee. The
      Committee only raised certain demands pertaining to periphery
      development. Thus, all the petitioners by the conduct estopped to
      challenge    the   acquisition   proceeding   at   a  belated  stage.  The
      notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was issued on 10.3.2011 and
      declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act was made on 29.2.2012. The
      writ application was filed on 7.9.2012. Thus the writ application
      suffers from gross delay and laches.
      22.           On an anatomy of the pleadings, submissions advanced by
      the learned counsel for the parties and the decisions cited supra, we
      are in consensus ad idem that the writ application is sans any merit
      and deserves dismissal.
                    The writ application is accordingly dismissed. There shall
      be no order as to costs.
                                                           ………………………..
                                                           DR. A.K.RATH, J.
CHIEF JUSTICE       :   I agree.
                                                           …….…………………
