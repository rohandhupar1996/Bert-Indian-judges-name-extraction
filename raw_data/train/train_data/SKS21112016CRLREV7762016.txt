         P R E S E N T:
                      THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Date of Hearing and Order- 21.11.2016
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. K. Sahoo, J.       The    petitioner    No.1   Naba    Kumari    Mahakud     @
         Mohakuda is the mother-in-law and petitioner No.2 Bhardwaj
         Mahakud @ Bharadwaja Mohakud is the elder brother-in-law of
         the deceased Subasini Dehury. They have filed this revision
         application challenging the impugned order dated 27.07.2016
         passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Angul in C.T. (S) Case
         No.10 of 2006 in framing charge under sections 498-A, 304-B,

                                2
306, 406, 506 read with section 34 of Indian Penal Code and
section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
2.          The prosecution case, as per the First Information
Report lodged by one Panabudu Dehury before the officer in
charge of Athmallik Police Station on 08.08.2005 is that the
deceased was given in marriage with one Hemanta Mohakud on
13.02.2005 in accordance with Hindu rites and customs and few
days after the marriage, the petitioners along with the husband
of the deceased Hemanta Mohakud and sister-in-law (husband’s
elder brother’s wife) Anjali Mahakud subjected the deceased to
physical and mental torture. They demanded a further sum of
Rs.10,000/- and a fridge. The deceased came to her father’s
place about one and half months prior to the date of occurrence
and at that point of time, she complained before her family
members regarding her torture and she was not even inclined to
return back to her in-law’s house. It is stated that due to mental
torture, the pregnancy of the deceased was terminated. The
deceased was left in the house of her in-laws on 27.06.2005 by
the informant and on 04.08.2005 the informant came to know
that the deceased had sustained burn injuries and she was
admitted in the Government Hospital at Cuttack. The informant
and his other family members rushed to the hospital and found

                                 3
the deceased was being treated at S.C.B. Medical College and
Hospital, Cuttack and she had sustained burn injuries on her
body and the deceased disclosed before the informant that on
03.08.2005 in the midnight while she was sleeping, her husband
Hemanta Mahakud and elder sister-in-law Anjali Mahakud poured
kerosene on her and set her on fire and the door of that room
was locked from outside and hearing the cry of the deceased, the
other family members came and rescued the deceased and
shifted her to the hospital.
3.          On 08.08.2005 on the basis of such First Information
Report, Athmallik P.S. Case No. 73 of 2005 was registered under
Sections 498-A/302/304-B/34 of the Indian Penal Code read with
Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against the four accused
persons including the petitioners.
            It appears that prior to the admission of the deceased
in the S.C.B. Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack, her dying
declaration   was   recorded    at  S.D.   Hospital,   Athmallik in
connection with Athmallik P.S. S.D.E. No. 52 dated 04.08.2005,
where the deceased stated that she herself poured kerosene on
her body and set herself on fire out of anger.
4.          The    Investigating   Officer  after    completion  of
investigation found prima facie case under sections 498-A,

                                4
304-B, 306, 506, 406 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code and section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and accordingly
submitted charge sheet on 24.12.2005 against four accused
persons.
5.          The   learned   counsel   for  the   petitioners  while
challenging the impugned order dated 27.07.2016, submitted
that the husband of the deceased was charged in C.T.(S) Case
No. 119 of 2006 vide order dated 18.03.2009 under sections
498-A, 302, 304-B read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code
and section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and therefore, in
relation to the self same case, charge cannot be framed against
some accused under section 302 of Indian Penal Code and
against some others under sections 304-B and 306 of the Indian
Penal Code and the prosecution must bring concrete materials on
record as to whether it is a case of under section 302 of I.P.C. or
under sections 306 and 304-B I.P.C. Learned counsel further
submitted that in view of the fact in the oral dying declaration
made before the informant at the S.C.B. Medical College and
Hospital, Cuttack, the deceased has implicated only two accused
persons namely Hemanta Mahakud and Anjali Mahakud to have
set fire to her and has not implicated the petitioners to have
played any role in her death, therefore, the order of framing

                                5
charge under section 304-B and 306 of the Indian Penal Code are
vitiated in the eye of law.
6.           The learned counsel for the State on the other hand
has produced the Case Diary and submitted that during course of
investigation, numbers of witnesses have been examined and
they have implicated the petitioners in connection with the
transaction that led to the death of the deceased. Learned
counsel for the State placed the statement of Bhuban Kheti who
has stated that the deceased committed suicide. Learned counsel
for the State further contended that there are ample materials on
record that the deceased was subjected to physical and mental
torture in connection with demand of dowry after her marriage by
the petitioners and the occurrence took place within six months
of her marriage and therefore, it can be said that the ingredients
of the offences under Sections 304-B and 306 Indian Penal Code
are clearly made out.
7.           Law is well settled that at the time of framing of
charge, it is not necessary for the prosecution to establish the
case beyond unreasonable doubt. The Court is not required to
hold a mini trial and come to a conclusion that the materials
adduced in the case are sufficient to warrant conviction. Where
the materials in the form of statements made before the police,

                                6
dying declaration and post mortem report, a clear prima facie
case for framing of the charges is made out, the learned Trial
Court can frame the charge against the accused. At the stage of
framing charge, even a strong suspicion based on cogent
materials is sufficient enough for the Court to frame a charge
against the accused persons. It is not necessary for the Trial
Court to weigh the       pros   and cons and to consider       the
improbability features of the prosecution case.
8.          In view of the prima facie materials available on
record that the petitioners and the other co-accused persons
were subjecting the deceased to physical and mental torture in
connection with demand of dowry and the post mortem report
findings that it is a case of unnatural death which took place
within six months of the marriage of the deceased and in view of
the statement of the deceased before the doctor at S.D. Hospital,
Athamallik that she had poured kerosene on her and set herself
on fire, I am of the view that there were sufficient materials for
the   Trial Court   to  frame    charges  under  sections 498-A,
304-B, 306, 506 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code
and section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Even though the co-
accused has been charged under section 302 of the Indian Penal
Code, since he has withdrawn the revision petition filed by him

                                        7
today in Criminal Revision No. 566 of 2009, it cannot be a ground
to quash the charge against the petitioners.
                 Accordingly, I find no illegality or infirmity in the
impugned order and therefore, the revision petition filed by the
petitioners being devoid of merits, stands dismissed.
                                                      …………………………
                                                      S.K. Sahoo, J.
