        Mr. DK Mishra, learned senior counsel, assisted by Mr.IH
        Saikia and Mr. B Prasad, learned counsel for the appellants.
        Mr. D Saikia, learned Additional Senior Advocate General,
        Assam, assisted by Ms. P Chakraborty learned Standing
        Counsel, Education Department for the Respondents.
        This intra court appeal is directed against the order dated
25.4.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court
whereby he has disposed of appellants’ WP(C) No.3074/2011 with
certain directions.
        The case of appellants is that vide advertisement dated
3.9.1991, the State Government invited applications for filling up 200
posts of Assistant Teachers in different High Schools. And to meet out
the demand of more teachers due to increase in number of students,
the State Government appointed many persons on ad-hoc basis by
creating new posts. However, after completion of selection process
pursuant to advertisement dated 3.9.1991 a select list was published
on 4.1.1995 wherein names of appellants were shown as selected
candidates. The select list was however challenged before this Court
by some candidates in CR No.5216/1996 which was disposed of vide
order dated 2.8.1997 with a direction against the authorities to
terminate the services of appellants along with other candidates who
were appointed without selection or in violation of merit position in
the select list. And this order dated 2.8.1997 was challenged in WA
No.500/1997 which was decided vide order dated 12.5.2000 with a
direction that order dated 2.8.1997 will have no effect on the
appointments, which were made outside the advertised posts against
future vacancies or the appointments, which were made pursuant to
Court’s order. Be that as it may, The Inspector of Schools first issued
                                                            page 1 of 2

show cause notices dated 26.5.2011 to the appellants as to why their
services should not be terminated and thereafter their services were
also terminated. Aggrieved, they filed WP(C) No.3074/2011 which has
been disposed of by the learned Single Judge vide order dated
25.4.2017 with a direction that their cases shall be re-examined by a
High Power Committee constituted by the State Government in the
light of order dated 2.8.1997 passed in CR No.5216/1996.
         The learned senior counsel for the appellants has submitted
that since the order dated 2.8.1997 was modified vide order dated
12.5.2000 passed in WA No.500/1997 the High Power Committee be
directed to also consider the order dated 12.5.2000 while considering
the case of appellants.
         After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and with their
consent, we finally dispose of the appeal with a direction that
appellants shall be at liberty to produce all the relevant judgments
before the High Power Committee which shall consider them by
passing a speaking order.
         JUDGE                                      CHIEF JUSTICE
