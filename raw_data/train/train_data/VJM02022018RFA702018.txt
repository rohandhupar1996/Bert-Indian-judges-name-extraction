              C.M. stands disposed of.
RFA No.70/2018 and C.M. Nos.2713/2018(stay) & 3529/2018
(under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC)
2.            This Regular First Appeal is filed under Section 96 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) impugning the judgment of the
trial court dated 12.12.2017 by which the trial court has dismissed the
suit   filed   by   the  appellant/plaintiff    seeking    declaration     of
appellant/plaintiff’s ownership to the first floor of the property bearing
RFA No.70/2018                                                  Page 1 of 18

no.1/4847 Gali No.11, Balbir Nagar Extension, Shahdara, Delhi-32 on
the basis of the Will dated 16.7.1997 of Smt. Tara Devi, the owner.
The appellant/plaintiff also seeks declaration that the Will dated
12.7.2002 executed by Smt. Tara Devi in favour of the respondent
no.1/defendant no.1/Sh. Sushil Kumar Aggarwal is null and void.
3.(i)         The facts of the case are that the appellant/plaintiff
pleaded that he was the grandson of Smt. Tara Devi and who had
executed her registered Will dated 16.7.1997 bequeathing the suit
property in favour of the appellant/plaintiff. Smt. Tara Devi expired
on 21.9.2002. The appellant/plaintiff pleaded to be in possession of
the suit property till 21.5.2004 when he pleads that he was
dispossessed by the respondent no.1/defendant no.1.
(ii)   There were two defendants in the suit with the defendant no.1
being Sh. Sushil Kumar Aggarwal and defendant no.2 being the wife
of the defendant no.1. They filed their joint written statement pleading
that the appellant/plaintiff is not the grandson of Smt. Tara Devi but is
the grandson of the sister of Smt. Tara Devi, namely Smt. Shanti Devi.
As per the written statement, the respondents/defendants pleaded that
the real father of the appellant/plaintiff Sh. Radhey Shyam was living
RFA No.70/2018                                              Page 2 of 18

in the ground floor of the property in question and when Smt. Tara
Devi called him to prepare the Will in favour of her son the
respondent no.1/defendant no.1, then Sh. Radhey Shyam in fact got
the Will dated 16.7.1997 executed in favour of the appellant/plaintiff.
When Smt. Tara Devi came to know of this fact she revoked the Will
dated 16.7.1997 by destroying the same and she executed her Will
dated 12.7.2002 in favour of the respondent no.1/defendant no.1/son.
It is further pleaded in the written statement that Sh. Radhey Shyam,
the father of the appellant/plaintiff was in illegal possession of the
ground floor of the property in question, and therefore Smt. Tara Devi
entered into a written compromise agreement dated 3.6.2002 with Sh.
Radhey Shyam whereunder Sh. Radhey Shyam vacated the possession
of the ground floor of the property in question after receiving a sum of
Rs.1,10,000/- in full and final settlement from Smt. Tara Devi. Sh.
Radhey Shyam in terms of the compromise deed dated 3.6.2002 stated
that he had no claims in the properties of Smt. Tara Devi. The suit was
therefore prayed to be dismissed.
4.            After pleadings were complete, the trial court framed the
following issues:-
RFA No.70/2018                                              Page 3 of 18

      “(i)     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief of declaration, possession,
      mandatory injunction and permanent injunction in relation to first floor of
      property bearing No.1/4847, Gali No.11, Balbir Nagar Extn., Shahdara,
      Delhi-32? OPP
      (ii)     Whether Late Smt. Tara Devi executed any valid Will dt. 16.07.97
      (registered on 17.07.97) in favour of plaintiff in respect of first floor of
      property bearing No.1/4847, Gali No.11, Balbir Nagar Extn., Shahdara,
      Delhi-32? OPP
      (iii)    Whether the plaintiff is entitled to mesne profits alongwith interest
      at the rate of 18% PA as prayed for? OPP
      (iv)     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recovery of mesne profits
      between January 2007 to December 2009 at the rate of Rs.3,000/- per
      month alongwith interest at the rate of 18% PA from the date of filing of
      the suit till realization? OPP
      (v)      Whether Late Smt. Tara Devi executed any valid will dt. 12.07.02
      in favour of defendant No.1? OPD-1
      (vi)     Relief.”
5.             On the aforesaid issues, parties led evidence and these
aspects are recorded in paras 6 and 7 of the impugned judgment and
which paras read as under:-
      “6.      The plaintiff filed his affidavit by way of evidence Ex. PW 1/A
      and examined himself as PW-1 in support of the case. The witness
      deposed nothing but as per averments made in the plaint. The
      witness has also deposed regarding the documents i.e. Ex. PW 1/ 1 site

      1913 dt. 17.07.1997. The certified copy of the above will already Ex. PW

      Petitioner also summoned and examined the witness i.e. Sh. Rahul Jain,

      affairs as PW-4 appeared with the summoned record i.e. the record of Sh.

      of NCT of Delhi( department of law) as notary public on 22.04.1985.
      Copy of the appointment of Sh. Dasa Ram as notary public Ex. PW 4/A
      which bears signature of Dasa Ram at pt. A. His appointment was renewed
      for three years with effect from 22.04.1988 to 17.05.1991. It was further
      renewed for three years from 22.04.1991 to 21.04.94. Thereafter the
      appointment was not renewed. His certificate was cancelled by
      notification No. F.3/06/Lit/02/437 dt. 17.04.2003 Ex. PW 4/ B.
      Petitioner also examined other witness i.e. Sh. V. K. Bhardwaj as PW-5
      by way of affidavit Ex. PW 5/ A. PE was thereafter closed.
      7.      Defendant No. 1 filed his affidavit by way of evidence Ex. DW 1/
      1 and was cross examined till 20.08.2015 at length by the ld. Counsel for
      plaintiff. Thereafter the defendant No. 1 failed to appear and the reports on
      the court notice received that he has expired. The application U/o 22 Rule
      4 CPC filed by plaintiff to bring on record the LRs of defendant No. 1
      which was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dt. 23.08.2017. The
      defendant No. 2 was also proceeded ex parte vide order dt. 29.03.2017.
      Another witness Sh. Shiv Shankar Gupta was examined as DW-2 vide
      affidavit Ex. DW 2/ A who also deposed regarding the compromise deed

      Devi already Ex. DW 1/A and will Ex. DW 1/B executed by Tara Devi in
      favour of defendant No. 1. Other attesting witness of the will Sh. Jasbir
      Singh was examined as DW-3 by way of affidavit Ex. DW 3/ A who also
      deposed regarding the execution of will dt. 12.07.02 Ex. DW 1/ B
      executed by Smt. Tara Devi in favour of defendant No. 1.
      DE was thereafter closed.”
6.            At the outset, a very important and curious fact needs to
be noticed. Respondent no.1/defendant no.1 expired during the
pendency of the suit and the appellant/plaintiff did file an application
under Order XXII Rule 4(3) CPC to bring on record the legal heirs of
the  deceased       respondent       no.1/defendant       no.1    however       the
RFA No.70/2018                                                      Page 5 of 18

appellant/plaintiff withdrew that application. In my opinion therefore
the consequence is that the suit in any case had to be dismissed as
abated on account of the appellant/plaintiff not bringing on record the
legal heirs of the deceased respondent no.1/defendant no.1. Of course,
by the time the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 expired, he had led his
evidence and was partly cross-examined, and he had also led the
evidence of the two attesting witnesses of the Will dated 12.7.2002
namely Sh. Shiv Shankar Gupta and Sh. Jasbir Singh. These two
attesting witnesses were cross-examined in detail on behalf of the
appellant/plaintiff and thereafter the cross-examination of these
witnesses was closed. The orders of the trial court noting the filing of
the application by the appellant/plaintiff under Order XXII Rule 4(3)
CPC and thereafter withdrawing the same are orders dated 18.7.2017
and 23.8.2017 and these orders read as under:-
       “Order dated 18.07.2017
       Present: Sh. Sharvan Dev, Advocate for the plaintiff with plaintiff in
       person.
       Sh. Anuj Jain, Advocate, for Central Bank of India/non-applicant.
       None for the defendants since morning, despite repeated calls.
               Ld. Counsel for Central Bank of India/non-applicant has filed the
       inspection report dated 04.02.2016, wherein, it has been reported that
       Sushil Kumar Aggarwal, Proprietor of M/s Srikrishna Traders, who has
       mortgaged the suit property, had expired some time ago. His neighbours
       could not disclose the name and address of the family members of
       deceased Sushil Kumar Aggarwal.
RFA No.70/2018                                                     Page 6 of 18

             Perusal of this inspection report clearly indicate that the said report
     is not based on any authentic verification/information. Copy of the death
     certificate is also not attached with the report. Only on the basis of this
     report, it cannot be said that Sushil Kumar Aggarwal, defendant No.1 in
     the present suit, had already expired.
             Perusal of the record further shows that on the submissions of the
     Ld. Counsel for the non-applicant/Central Bank of India, the Ld. Counsel
     for the plaintiff has moved an application under Order 22 Rule 4 r/w Sec.
     151 CPC, on 25.05.2016. But, the said application is also not
     accompanied with any death certificate. Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff is
     directed to file the death certificate of defendant No.1 on record, on or
     before the next date of hearing.
             In the meantime, notice of the said application be also issued to the
     LRs of defendant No.1, on filing of PF, for the next date of hearing.
             Submissions of the Ld. Counsels for the parties on the application
     under Order 1 Rule 10 r/w Sec. 151 CPC dated 14.03.2016, are also heard.
             Adjourned for orders on the said application and for further
     proceedings on 05.08.2017.
                                                    BRIJESH KUMAR GARG
                                                    Addl. Distt Judge (NE)-01
                                                    18.07.2017
     Order dated 23.8.2017
     Present:         Plaintiff in person.
                      None for the non-applicant or the defendants.
             It has been submitted by the plaintiff that he is not aware about the
     death of the defendant Sushil Kumar Aggarwal, proprietor of M/s.
     Srikrishna Traders. He has further reported that he moved the application
     under Order 22 Rule 4 r/w Sec. 151 CPC on 25.05.2017, only on the basis
     of the inspection record of Central Bank of India/non-applicant. The
     report of the Central Bank of India, dated 04.02.2016 is also inconclusive.
             The plaintiff has further stated that the death certificate of
     defendant Sushil Kumar Aggarwal could not be traced by him, despite
     best efforts. He has prayed for withdrawal of his application under Order
     22 Rule 4 r/w Sec. 151 CPC.
             On his request, the said application is dismissed as withdrawn.
             Adjourned for orders on the application under Order 1 Rule 10 r/w
     Sec. 151 CPC dated 14.03.2016, on 05.09.2017.
                                                    BRIJESH KUMAR GARG
                                                    Addl. Distt Judge (NE)-01
                                                    18.07.2017”
RFA No.70/2018                                                       Page 7 of 18

In my opinion therefore the suit had abated and had to be dismissed as
abated on account of not bringing on record the legal heirs of the
deceased respondent no.1/defendant no.1 by the appellant/plaintiff.
7.           Now taking that the suit would not stand abated, let us
examine the facts as also the evidence on record as to whether the
appellant/plaintiff had proved the Will dated 16.7.1997 of late Smt.
Tara Devi and that whether the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 had
proved the subsequent Will dated 12.7.2002 of Smt. Tara Devi. As
discussed below, not only the appellant/plaintiff failed to prove the
Will dated 16.7.1997 of Smt. Tara Devi because the original of the
Will dated 16.7.1997 of Smt. Tara Devi never saw the light of the day,
but in any case assuming that the appellant/plaintiff had proved the
Will dated 16.7.1997, however since the respondent no.1/defendant
no.1 has proved the subsequent Will dated 12.7.2002 of Smt. Tara
Devi, therefore, it is the subsequent Will of Smt. Tara Devi dated
12.7.2002 which will hold the field and under which the respondent
no.1/defendant no.1 is the owner of the suit property as also the entire
property bearing no.1/4847, Gali No.11, Balbir Nagar Extn, Shahdara,
Delhi-32.
RFA No.70/2018                                             Page 8 of 18

8.               Section 70 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides
that a Will is revoked by destroying the same. Destroying of the Will
is one of the ways of revocation of the Will. Section 70 of the Indian
Succession Act reads as under:-
        “Section 70. Revocation of unprivileged Will or codicil. No
        unprivileged Will or codicil, nor any part thereof, shall be revoked
        otherwise than by marriage, or by another Will or codicil, or by some
        writing declaring an intention to revoke the same and executed in the
        manner in which an unprivileged Will is hereinbefore required to be
        executed, or by the burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying the same by
        the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction with the
        intention of revoking the same.”
9.(i)           Admittedly the original of the Will dated 16.7.1997 has
till date not seen the light of the day. The appellant/plaintiff pleaded
that this Will was stolen by the respondent no.1/defendant no.1,
however when in cross-examination the appellant/plaintiff was put a
question on 24.4.2012 that whether he had lodged any complaint for
theft of the original Will dated 16.7.1997 of which Will the certified
copy was proved as Ex.PW1/2, it was conceded by the
appellant/plaintiff that no such complaint with respect to an alleged
theft of the Will dated 16.7.1997 has been filed on record.
(ii)    Counsel for the appellant/plaintiff argued that appellant/plaintiff
had served a legal notice Ex.DW1/X1 dated 2.4.2014 under Order XII
RFA No.70/2018                                                        Page 9 of 18

Rule 8 CPC for the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 to file the original
Will, and that since the original Will dated 16.7.1997 was not filed by
the   respondent     no.1/defendant     no.1 pursuant  to  the   notice
Ex.DW1/X1, consequently, it is argued that the appellant/plaintiff
should succeed on the basis of the certified copy of the Will dated
16.7.1997 proved by the appellant/plaintiff as Ex.PW1/2. However in
my opinion, this argument urged on behalf of the appellant/plaintiff is
misconceived because a notice under Order XII Rule 8 CPC goes on
the basis that the original of the document exists and possession of
which is with the party to whom notice is given under Order XII Rule
8 CPC. In the facts of the present case as per the case of the
respondent no.1/defendant no.1 the Will dated 16.7.1997 was revoked
by Smt. Tara Devi by tearing the same and thus in my opinion the
mere fact that a notice under Order XII Rule 8 CPC is given by the
appellant/plaintiff to the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 would not
mean that original of the Will dated 16.7.1997 continued to exist and
was not destroyed by Smt. Tara Devi. This argument of the
appellant/plaintiff is therefore rejected.
RFA No.70/2018                                            Page 10 of 18

(iii)  Counsel for the appellant/plaintiff sought to place reliance upon
para 12 of the plaint and the response in written statement of the
respondents/defendants to para 12 of the plaint, and it is argued
accordingly that the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 in para 12 of the
written statement admitted to the theft of the Will, however, in my
opinion I do not see any admission whatsoever in para 12 of the
written statement that the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 admitted
that he had stolen the Will. A reference to para 12 of the written
statement only shows that the respondent no.1/defendant no.1
admitted to the execution of the Will dated 16.7.1997 by Smt. Tara
Devi, and which is in continuation of the factum that such Will was
executed. It is also stated that the Will dated 16.7.1997 was thereafter
revoked. In the other portion of para 12 of the written statement the
respondent no.1/defendant no.1 has denied rest of the contents of para
12 of the plaint in response to para 12 of the plaint and which referred
to stealing of the Will allegedly by the respondent no.1/defendant
no.1.
10.          Also in my opinion the story put forth by the
appellant/plaintiff of the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 stealing the
RFA No.70/2018                                              Page 11 of 18

Will is in fact wholly false to the knowledge of the appellant/plaintiff
because the fact of the matter is that Smt. Tara Devi herself had
destroyed her Will dated 16.7.1997. This destroying of the Will dated
16.7.1997 is deposed to by both the attesting witnesses of the second
Will dated 12.7.2002 namely Sh. Jasbir Singh and Sh. Shiv Shankar
Gupta who have clearly deposed in their affidavits by way of evidence
that Smt. Tara Devi had destroyed the Will dated 16.7.1997 relied
upon by the appellant/plaintiff.
11.(i)        The stand of the appellant/plaintiff that allegedly the Will
dated 16.7.1997 was stolen by the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 is a
completely false stand and which also becomes clear from the contents
of the compromise deed dated 3.6.2002 entered into between Sh.
Radhey Shyam (son of Sh. Shobha Ram and who is the father of the
appellant/plaintiff) and Smt. Tara Devi. This compromise deed has
been proved and exhibited by the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 as
Ex.DW1/A. This compromise deed reads as under:-
       “              COMPROMISE AGREEMENT/DEED
              This Compromise Deed is hereby executed on this 03rd June 2002

                                              2.     SECOND PARTY”
                                                                (emphasis added)
RFA No.70/2018                                                      Page 13 of 18

(ii)  A reading of the aforesaid compromise deed makes it clear that
Sh. Radhey Shyam, father of the appellant/plaintiff, gave up
possession of the ground floor of the property in question and received
a sum of Rs.1,10,000/- and he agreed that he will make no claim to
any of the properties of Smt. Tara Devi. This compromise deed also
shows that appellant/plaintiff who claims to be the son of the Sh.
Radhey Shyam was not the grandson of the Smt. Tara Devi because
the compromise deed dated 3.6.2002 shows Smt. Tara Devi as the
wife of Sh. Rehtu Lal and not of Sh. Shobha Ram. Appellant/plaintiff
has also filed no documentary evidence on record as to Sh. Shobha
Ram being the husband of Smt. Tara Devi and in fact Smt. Tara Devi
was the wife of late Sh. Rehtu Lal. Smt. Tara Devi was the sister of
the real grandmother of the appellant/plaintiff namely Smt. Shanti
Devi and who was the wife of Sh. Shobha Ram. Therefore in view of
these facts there was no reason why Smt. Tara Devi would have
Willed her property to the appellant/plaintiff who was not her
grandson and instead of in favour of the respondent no.1/defendant
no.1 who was her son. Clearly, the appellant/plaintiff is acting
dishonestly after his father Sh. Radhey Shyam received a sum of
RFA No.70/2018                                             Page 14 of 18

Rs.1,10,000/- under the compromise deed dated 3.6.2002 and agreed
that he would not claim any right to any property of Smt. Tara Devi.
12.          On behalf of the appellant/plaintiff it is next argued that
the Will Ex.DW1/B is shown to be notarized but it has been proved by
the appellant/plaintiff by calling Sh. Rahul Jain PW-4 from the office
of the Department of Law and Justice that the notary Sh. Dasa Ram,
Advocate who attested the Will Ex.DW1/B as a notary public, was not
a notary public in the year 2002 as his licence had come to an end on
21.4.1994. However in my opinion this will only show that Sh. Dasa
Ram defrauded Smt. Tara Devi by representing himself to be a notary
public although he was not a licenced notary public on the date of
execution of the Will dated 12.7.2002 by Smt. Tara Devi. Since, in
law there is no legal need for notarization of the Will, at best it will be
shown that the Will dated 12.7.2002 is not notarized, however, the
Will is otherwise proved through the depositions of the two attesting
witnesses Sh. Shiv Shankar Gupta and Sh. Jasbir Singh who had
deposed as DW-2 and DW-3. The argument of the appellant/plaintiff
is therefore rejected that the Will dated 12.7.2002/Ex.DW1/B has to
be discarded as Sh. Dasa Ram, Advocate is shown not to be a notary
RFA No.70/2018                                               Page 15 of 18

public as on 12.7.2002 when the Will was executed by Smt. Tara
Devi.
13.            Learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff then argued
that the trial court has erred in holding that no proof was filed that the
appellant/plaintiff did not live with Smt. Tara Devi and reference of
this Court is invited to Ex.PW1/6 being an election identity card as on
28.7.2002 showing the residence of the appellant/plaintiff as that of
the    suit   property,   however,    in   my    opinion   even    if  the
appellant/plaintiff is successful in proving his residence through the
election identity card, yet that does not mean that the Will dated
12.7.2002/Ex.DW1/B on this count itself is liable to be rejected
although the same is otherwise proved through both the attesting
witnesses. This argument of the appellant/plaintiff is also therefore
rejected.
14.            Learned counsel for the appellant/plaintiff finally argued
that the trial court has wrongly observed that appellant/plaintiff did not
file ay police complaint against the theft of the Will by the respondent
no.1/defendant no.1 and reference is invited to additional document
filed with this appeal being the complaint dated 30.1.2003, however,
RFA No.70/2018                                               Page 16 of 18

admittedly this complaint was not filed and proved or exhibited before
the trial court, and therefore this Court cannot consider the same
inasmuch as only the admitted and proved documents before the trial
court can be considered by the first appellate court. In any case even
if I consider this complaint dated 30.1.2003 I do not find any specific
averment in this complaint dated 30.1.2003 to the Police
Commissioner       wherein    it  is   categorically   stated   by    the
appellant/plaintiff that the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 had stolen
the Will dated 16.7.1997. This argument of the appellant/plaintiff is
also therefore rejected.
15.           It is therefore held that appellant/plaintiff was not the
grandson of Smt. Tara Devi and that the appellant/plaintiff was in fact
the grandson of Smt. Shanti Devi wife of Sh. Shobha Ram and that
Smt. Tara Devi was the wife of Sh. Rehtu Lal and who was thus the
father of respondent no.1/defendant no.1 (son of Smt. Tara Devi). The
Will dated 12.7.2002 has been duly proved by the respondent
no.1/defendant no.1 as Ex.DW1/B. Both the attesting witnesses who
deposed as DW-2 and DW-3 namely Sh. Shiv Shankar Gupta and Sh.
Jasbir Singh have deposed in their affidavits by way of evidence the
RFA No.70/2018                                              Page 17 of 18

due execution and attestation of the Will and they have remained
strong in their cross-examination and have disputed and denied the
case which was set up by the appellant/plaintiff of the Will dated
12.7.2002/Ex.DW1/B by Smt. Tara Devi not being the duly executed
Will of Smt. Tara Devi. Merely putting suggestions in cross-
examination of the Will dated 12.7.2002 not being duly executed and
attested, and which suggestions are denied by DW-2 and DW-3 who
are the attesting witnesses to the Will dated 12.7.2002, cannot mean
that the Will dated 12.7.2002 does not stand validly proved as
Ex.DW1/B. In terms of the Will dated 12.7.2002 Ex.DW1/B it has to
be held that it is the respondent no.1/defendant no.1 who is the owner
of the suit property as the same was bequeathed to the respondent
no.1/defendant no.1/son by the mother Smt. Tara Devi.
16.          In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the
appeal, and the same is therefore dismissed.
