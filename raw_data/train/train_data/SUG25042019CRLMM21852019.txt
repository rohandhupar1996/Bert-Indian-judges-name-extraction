       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR
                           ORDER
                            (ORAL)
       Quashing of FIR No. 954/2013, under Sections 498-A/406/423/34
of IPC, registered at Police Station Mehrauli, Delhi is sought on the basis
of Settlement Deed of 8th January, 2016 and affidavit of 24th April, 2019
of respondent No. 2.
       Upon notice, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent
No.1-State submits that respondent No.2, present in the Court, is the
complainant/first-informant of FIR in question and she has been
identified to be so, by SI Satender Gulia on the basis of identity proof
produced by her.
       Respondent No.2, present in the Court, submits that the dispute
Crl.M.C. 2185/2019                                                    Page 1 of 3

between the parties has been amicably resolved. She affirms the contents
of her affidavit of 24th April, 2019 and submits that now no dispute with
petitioners survives and so, the proceedings arising out of the FIR in
question be brought to an end.
       Supreme Court in Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai
Vs. State of Gujarat (2017) 9 SCC 641 has reiterated the parameters for
exercising inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of
FIR/criminal complaint, which are as under:-
       “16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be
    criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant
    element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing
    insofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is
    concerned.
    16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from
    commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar
    transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate
    situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the
    dispute.
    16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal
    proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants,
    the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of
    a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice.”
       Since the subject matter of this FIR is essentially matrimonial,
which now stands mutually and amicably settled between parties,
therefore, continuance of proceedings arising out of the FIR in question
would be an exercise in futility.
       Accordingly, this petition is allowed subject to costs of ₹10,000/-
to be deposited by petitioners with Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund
within a week from today. Upon placing on record the proof of deposit of
Crl.M.C. 2185/2019                                                Page 2 of 3

costs within a week thereafter and handing over its copy to the
Investigating Officer, FIR No. 954/2013, under Sections 498-
A/406/423/34 of IPC, registered at Police Station Mehrauli, Delhi and the
proceedings emanating therefrom shall stand quashed qua petitioners.
       This petition and application are accordingly disposed of.
       Dasti.
