CM No. 1166 of 2010 (for Delay)
        The delay in filing the appeal is condoned.     The application stands
disposed of.
ITA No. 119 of 2010
1.      This appeal is directed against the order of the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal dated 5th December, 2008 in ITA No. 3804/DEL/2007 relating to
Assessment Year 2003-04. We find that the Tribunal has given findings on
three factual aspects of the matter. The first addition made by the Assessing
ITA 119/2010                                                             Page 1 of 4

Officer was on account of disallowance of Rs 6,91,481/- on the ground that
there were no business activities carried out by the assessee during the
relevant period. The Tribunal has confirmed the deletion of the said amount
by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The Tribunal came to the
conclusive finding of fact that the Assessee carried on business during the
Assessment Year 2003-04 as the Assessee did a computer programming job
for Fortis Financial Services for which payment had also been received by
the Assessee. It had also rendered financial consultancy services by
arranging a loan from CitiCorp for Oscar Investment Ltd and had received
commission. Consequently, the Tribunal held that the disallowance was
rightly deleted by the CIT(A).
2.      The Assessing Officer has also made an addition on account of sale of
a shop which, according to the Assessing Officer, had an estimated value of
Rs 5,00,000/-. The shop in question was in the occupation of a tenant and
was a temporary structure known as a “khokha” and measured only about 30
sq. feet. The Assessee was receiving only a sum of Rs 47.50 per month by
way of rent in respect of the said shop.
3.      It is true that the Assessee was not able to produce a sale deed in
respect of the said shop, however, the Tribunal noted that the Assessee has
produced sale deeds in respect of similar shops sold in March 1997 and
December, 1998 in the same locality. The factual position in respect of
those sale deeds in that those shops were sold for Rs 4,500/- and Rs 9,500/-.
ITA 119/2010                                                        Page 2 of 4

Consequently, the Tribunal held that the sum of Rs 6,000/- indicated by the
Assessee as being the sale price of the said shop was acceptable. The
Tribunal also noted that the Assessee could not evict the tenant and as such
the Assessee decided to sell the structure to the tenant himself. The Tribunal
also came to the conclusion that there was no evidence of any additional
amount being received by the Assessee over and above the amount of Rs
6,000/- disclosed by the Assessee in his account.
4.      Thus on the findings of fact, the Tribunal upheld the view taken by the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and accepted the sale price as Rs
6,000/- and, therefore, deleted the addition made by the Assessing Officer.
5.      The third addition made by the Assessing Officer was of Rs 5,000/-
on account of unexplained cash credit under Section 68 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. The said cash credit was deleted by CIT(A) and the deletion was
confirmed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal recorded
that there was no question with regard to the genuineness of the cash credit
and the only point raised by the Revenue was that the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) had admitted additional evidence introduced by the
Assessee at the stage of the appeal. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,
after referring to Rule 46A, concluded that the              Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) had exercised his discretion in allowing
the additional evidence and had also afforded an opportunity to
the Assessing      Officer    to     examine     the    additional    evidence.
ITA 119/2010                                                           Page 3 of 4

The Tribunal held that since there was no challenge to the genuineness of the
cash credit, the finding of CIT(A) in deleting the said addition after
admitting additional evidence did not call for any interference.
6.      We agree with the view taken by the Tribunal on this aspect of the
matter.
7.      No perversity in the findings of the Tribunal has been pointed out by
the learned counsel for the Revenue. No substantial question of law arises
for our consideration. The appeal is therefore dismissed.
