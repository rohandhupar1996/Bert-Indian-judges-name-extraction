MANMOHAN, J:
1.      The present appeal has been filed under Section 260A of the
Income Tax Act,1961 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”) challenging the
order dated 07th August, 2009 passed by the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal (in short “Tribunal”) in ITA No. 1127/Del/2005 for the
Assessment Year 1997-1998.
2.      Briefly stated the relevant facts of the present case are that on
06th March, 2000, the respondent-assessee’s assessment after scrutiny
was completed.           However, during the course of proceedings under
Section 263 of the Act for the assessment year 1999-2000, it was
noticed that the respondent-assessee had claimed expenditure                           of
ITA 1355/2010                                                              Page 1 of 6

`15,36,395/- under the heading “partners training expenses”. Out of
the said expenditure, ` 10,46,391/- was claimed in the assessment year
1997-1998.      Consequently, on 30th November, 2004, notice under
Section 148 of the Act was issued to the respondent-assessee.
3.     In proceedings under Section 148 of the Act, the said expenditure
was disallowed.     Even the appeal filed by the respondent-assessee
before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [in short, “CIT(A)”]
was dismissed.
4.     However, the Tribunal allowed the appeal of the respondent-
assessee after holding that the Assessing Officer (in short, “AO”) had
not made out any case in the reasons recorded for issuance of a notice
under Section 148 of the Act. According to the Tribunal, there was no
failure on the part of the respondent-assessee to disclose all material
facts with regard to its claim for “partner training expenses”.
5.     Ms. Rashmi Chopra, learned counsel for the Revenue submitted
that the Tribunal had erred in law in quashing the reassessment order
under Section 147 of the Act.
6.     Having heard learned counsel for the Revenue and having
perused the impugned order, we are in agreement with the view of the
Tribunal that the reassessment was barred by limitation as the period of
four years had already expired from the end of the relevant Assessment
ITA 1355/2010                                               Page 2 of 6

Year and as one of the conditions precedent in the first proviso to
Section 147 was not fulfilled in the present case.
7.     In fact, the first proviso to Section 147 which provides extended
limitation for reassessment i.e. beyond the period of four years reads as
under:-
       “Provided that where an assessment under sub-section (3)
       of section 143 or this section has been made for the
       relevant Assessment Year, no action shall be taken under
       this section after the expiry of four years from the end of
       the relevant Assessment Year, unless any income
       chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for such
       Assessment Year by reason of failure on the part of the
       assessee to make a return under section 139 or in response
       to a notice issued under sub-section (1) of section 142 or
       section 148 or to disclose fully and truly all material facts
       necessary for his assessment, for that Assessment Year.”
8.      From a plain reading of the above proviso, it is apparent that
where an assessment under Section 143(3) has been made, as in the
present case, no action can be taken under Section 147 of the Act, 1961
after expiry of four years from the end of the relevant Assessment Year
unless two conditions are simultaneously fulfilled i.e. firstly, the AO
must have reasons to believe the income chargeable to tax has escaped
assessment and secondly, the AO must have reasons to believe that
such escapement occurred either due to omission or failure on the part
of the respondent-assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts
necessary for its assessment [See CIT vs. Rajesh Jhavery Stock
Brokers Pvt. Ltd. (2007) 291 ITR 500 at 512; Haryana Acrylic

9.     In the present case, the Tribunal in its impugned order has
concluded as under:-
       “16. In the light of the position of law as discussed above,
       we have now to examine the facts of the present case as to
       whether the condition that there was omission or failure on
       the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all
       material facts necessary for his assessment is satisfied in
       the present case. On perusal of the reasons record by the
       A.O. for initiating proceeding u/s. 147 of the Act, we find
       that the A.O. has initiated re-assessment proceedings for
       A.Y. 1997-98 and 1998-99, in the light of the order passed
       by the CIT u/s. 263 on 08.03.2004 for the A.Y. 1999-2000
       holding that the expenditure claimed under the heard
       “partners training expenses” has been wrongly allowed by
       the A.O., and in the assessment for the A.Y. 2001-02, the
       expenses claimed by the assessee under the head “partners
       training expenses” has not been allowed as not having
       been incurred for the purpose of business. It is thus clear
       that the A.O. has reopened the assessment for the A.Y.
       1997-98 and 1998-99, in the light of the findings or the
       decisions taken in the A.Y. 1999-2000 and 2001-02, with
       regard to the allowability of the expenses under the heard
       “partners training expenses”. The A.O. has nowhere in
       the reasons recorded a finding that there was a failure on
       the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all
       material facts relating to the claim of expenses made under
       the head “partners training expenses”. There is not even
       a whisper of an allegation in the reasons recorded that the
       escapement income had occurred by reason of failure on
       the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all
       material facts necessary for his assessment. The original
       assessment was completed u/s 143(3) of the Act in
       pursuance to the return of income filed originally on
       31.10.1997. In the return of income, the assessee
       furnished copy of audit report obtained u/s.44B along with
ITA 1355/2010                                               Page 4 of 6

       audited balance sheet, P&L account, trading account etc.,
       details of depreciation, payment of interest, salary,
       commission etc. to partners, details of payment to persons
       specified in section 40(2)(b) of the Act and the details of
       the loans and advances etc. In the P&L account, the
       assessee has given a separate item of “partners training
       expenses” claimed at Rs.10,46,397/-. This is not the case
       where the partners training expenses has been included
       elsewhere in other heads of expenses. The assessee has
       claimed the expenses under the item as “partners training
       expenses” separately and distinctly in the P&L account.
       Whatever expenses have been claimed towards partners
       training expenses has been specifically mentioned in the
       P&L account.            During the original assessment
       proceedings, audited copies of P&L account, balance
       sheet and trading account were duly examined by the A.O.
       as so mentioned by the A.O. himself in the assessment
       order so made u/s. 143(3) of the Act on 06.03.2000.
       17. In the light of the discussion made and facts noted
       about, it is clear that the A.O. has not made out any case in
       the reasons recorded for issuing a notice u/s. 148 of the
       Act that there was a failure on the part of the assessee to
       disclose fully and truly all material facts with regard to the
       claim of partners training expenses made in the return of
       income. Further, we find that the assessee had disclosed
       fully and truly the facts of claiming partners training
       expenses at Rs. 10,46,391/- as so clearly stated in the P&L
       account as a separate and distinct item. Therefore, not-
       with-standing the fact that the first condition to invoke the
       provisions of Section 147 of the Act that there must be a
       reason to believe that income had escape assessment is
       satisfied in the present case, the second condition that
       there must be failure on the part of the assessee to disclose
       fully and truly all material fact necessary for assessment
       has not been satisfied or has been proved to be satisfied.
       At this stage, we would like to clarify that had it been a
       case of initiating proceedings u/s. 147 of the Act before the
       expiry of four years from the end of the relevant
       assessment year, it was not necessary for the A.O. to prove
       and establish that there was a failure on the part of the
       assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts
ITA 1355/2010                                                Page 5 of 6

       necessary for his assessment, and only condition required
       to be satisfied by the A.O. would have been that he had
       reason to believe that any income chargeable to tax has
       escaped assessment. The CIT(A) has relied upon the
       decision of Hon’ble Gujarat High Court in the case of
       Prafful Chunni Lal Patel : Basant Chunni Lal Patel Vs.
       ACIT (1999) 236 ITR 832 (Guj.), which was rendered in
       the context of re-opening of the assessment within the
       period of four years from the end of the relevant
       assessment year, and the question about applicability of
       the proviso to section 147 was not a subject matter of
       consideration in that case. Thus, the decision of Hon’ble
       Gujarat High Court in the case of Prafful Chunni Lal Patel
       : Basant Chunni Lal Patel Vs. ACIT (1999) 236 ITR 832
       (Guj.), relied upon by the ld. CIT(A) in both the assessment
       years 1997-98 and 1998-99, doesn’t help the revenue on
       the facts of the present case in so far as A.Y. 1997-98 is
       concerned.
10.    Consequently, as the AO has failed to prove and establish that
there was failure on the part of the respondent-assessee to disclose
fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment, we are of
the opinion that the present case is not covered by the proviso to
Section 147 of the Act. Accordingly, the present appeal being bereft of
merit, is dismissed in limine but without any order as to costs.
