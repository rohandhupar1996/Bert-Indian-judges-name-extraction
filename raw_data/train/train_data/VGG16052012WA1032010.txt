                                    Date of Judgment :16.05.2012
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.N. Mahapatra, J.           This writ appeal has been filed for setting aside the orders
       passed under Annexures-1, 2 and 3. Annexure-1 is the order dated
       16.12.2009 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Balasore
       allowing CMA No. 46 of 2005 in part on contest subject to payment of cost of

                                      2
Rs.2000/- to the opposite party within a stipulated date, i.e., by 27.12.2009.
Annexure-2 is the revisional order dated 22.2.2010 passed by the learned
District Judge, Balasore-Bhadrak, Balasore in Civil Revision No. 1 of 2010
holding that the revision petition is not maintainable. Annexure-3 is the
order dated 19.3.2010 passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.(c) No.4524
of 2010 dismissing the writ petition on the ground that the trial court has
done substantial justice in the matter by restoring the Execution Case
subject to payment of cost of Rs.2000/- to the defendant in order to mitigate
the prejudice caused to him.
 2.           The facts and circumstances giving rise to the present writ
appeal are as follows:
              The writ appellant is the judgment-debtor in Execution Case
No.1 of 1988 pending in the court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division),
Balasore. The plaintiff-respondent filed suit being O.S. No.111 of 1976 for
specific performance and the same was decreed with a specific direction to
the appellant to execute the sale deed. Pursuant to the said decree, the
plaintiff-respondent instituted Execution Case No.1 of 1988 before the
learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Balasore. On 04.08.2000 advocate for
the DHR filed a petition praying to give possession. The said execution
case was dropped on 24.8.2004 as no step was taken by either parties
since long and none appeared on repeated calls on that day. The CMA
bearing No. 46 of 2005 was filed on 20.1.2005 by Decree-holder for
restoration of the execution case by invoking jurisdiction under Section
151, CPC and ultimately the same was allowed by the learned Civil Judge

                                       3
(Sr. Division) subject to payment of cost of Rs.2,000/- vide order dated
16.12.2009 (Annexure-1). Being aggrieved by the said order under
Annexure-1, the appellant had filed Civil Revision No.1 of 2010 which was
dismissed vide order dated 22.2.2010 (Annexure-2) on the ground that the
said revision petition was not maintainable.
3.            The writ appellant filed W.P.(c) No. 4524 of 2010 challenging
the revisional order dated 22.2.2010 with a prayer to set aside the said
order and for issuance of a direction to hear the revision petition on merit,
which was dismissed on the ground as stated above.
4.            Mr. R.C. Sarangi, learned counsel appearing for the writ
appellant submitted that a cryptic, non-speaking and unreasoned order has
been passed by the learned Single Judge without considering the totality of
the facts and circumstances of the case. The learned Single Judge has
failed to appreciate that Section 151, CPC cannot be invoked in favour of a
person who is guilty of delay and laches. The learned Single Judge should
not have granted relief indirectly which cannot be granted directly. The
effect of the order passed under Annexure-1 is a nullity having been passed
without jurisdiction. The Executing Court cannot act contrary to law.
Therefore, even though the power under Article 226 of the Constitution is
discretionary, the learned Single Judge should have declined to exercise her
discretionary power in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. Restoration of an
execution case is governed under Order 21, Rule 106, CPC which provides
for a special period of limitation of one month to make application for
restoration of the execution case. Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not

                                         4
applicable to the execution proceedings. Therefore, even when a restoration
application is filed in the garb of an application under Section 151, CPC,
the special period of limitation fixed expressly by the statute cannot be by-
passed.    In support of his above contention Mr. Sarangi relied upon a
decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Damodaran Pillai &
others v. South Indian Bank Ltd. , 2005 (II) CLR (SC)- 554 . The leaned
District Judge is not justified to hold that the revision is not maintainable
particularly when the effect of reversal of the impugned order before him
would have terminated the entire execution proceedings. It was further
submitted that learned District Judge is not justified to hold that civil
revision is not maintainable in view of decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
the case of Keshardeo Chamria v. Radha Kissan Chamria, AIR 1953 SC 23.
Learned Single Judge has dismissed the writ petition by a cryptic, bald and
unreasoned order. Concluding his argument Mr. Sarangi submitted for
grant of the relief sought for in the writ appeal.
5.           Mr.    U.K.  Mohanty,     learned    counsel appearing   for  the
respondent vehemently argued that the orders passed under Annexures-
1, 2 & 3 are perfectly justified warranting no interference by this Court.
6.           On the rival factual and legal contentions the following
questions fall for consideration by this Curt:
       (i)  Whether the order passed by the learned Single Judge
             under     Annexure-3     is   cryptic,  non-speaking   and
             unreasoned?

                                        5
       (ii)   Whether the orders passed under Annexures- 1, 2 and
              3 by the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Balasore,
              learned District Judge, Balasore and learned Single
              Judge of this Court respectively are not sustainable in
              law and are liable to be set aside?
7.            So far question no.(i) is concerned, perusal of order under
Annexure-3 passed by learned Single Judge of this Court reveals that the
leaned Single Judge has dismissed the writ petition assigning reasons.
According to the learned Single Judge, while restoring the execution case
the trial court has awarded cost of Rs.2,000/- to be paid to the Judgment
Debtor/defendant in order to mitigate prejudice caused to him. Learned
Single Judge further held that the trial court has done substantial justice
in the matter. In view of the same, it cannot be said that no reason has
been assigned by the learned Single Judge while passing the impugned
order under Annexure-3. Question no.(i) is accordingly answered.
8.            To deal with Question No.(ii), we have to examine as to whether
by exercising inherent power vested u/s. 151, CPC the learned Civil Judge
(Sr. Division) can restore the Execution Case No.1/1988 which was dropped
by him on 24.8.2004 for non-appearance of the Decree Holder upon
considering a petition for restoration filed by the Decree Holder beyond
period of one month provided under sub-rule (3) of Rule 106 of Order XXI of
the CPC. In other words, whether the executing court by exercising its power
u/s. 151, CPC can extend the period of limitation prescribed under Sub rule
(3) of Rule 106 of Order XXI of the C.P.C. for setting aside dismissal order

                                       6
passed under Rule 105(2). For this purpose, it is relevant to quote Rules 105
and 106 of Order XXI of C.P.C.
              “R.105. Hearing of application- (1) The Court, before
              which an application under any of the foregoing rules of
              this Order is pending, may fix a day for the hearing of
              the application.
              (2)   where on the day fixed or on any other day to
              which the hearing may be adjourned the applicant does
              not appear when the case is called on for hearing, the
              Court may make an order that the application be
              dismissed.
              (3) where the applicant appears and the opposite party
              to whom the notice has been issued by the court does
              not appear, the Court may hear the application ex parte
              and pass such orde4 as it thinks fit.
              R.106. Setting aside orders passed ex parte, etc.- (1)
              The applicant, against whom an order is made under
              sub-rule (2) of rule 105 or the opposite party against
              whom an order is passed ex parte under sub-rule (3) of
              that rule or under sub-rule (1) of rule 23, may apply to
              the Court to set aside the order, and if he satisfies the
              Court that there was sufficient cause for his non-
              appearance when the application was called on for
              hearing, the court shall set aside the order on such
              terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall
              appoint a day for the further hearing of the application.
              (2) No order shall be made on an application under
              sub-rule (1) unless notice of the application has been
              served on the other party.
              (3) An application under sub-rule (1) shall be made
              within thirty days from the date of the order, or where,
              in the case of an ex parte order, the notice was not duly
              served, within thirty days from the date when the
              applicant had knowledge of the order.”
9.            The above provision clearly shows that sub-rule (1) of Rule 105
of Order XXI provides for fixing a date for hearing of the application. Sub-
rule (2) of Rule 105 makes it clear that if on the day fixed or on the other day
to which the hearing may be adjourned, the applicant does not appear when
the case is called on for hearing, the Court may make an order for dismissal

                                       7
of the application. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 106 provides that the applicant
against whom an order is made under Sub-rule (2) of Rule 105 may apply to
the Court to set aside the said order and if he satisfies the Court that there is
sufficient reason for his non-appearance when the application was called on
for hearing, the Court shall set aside the order on such terms as to cost or
otherwise as it thinks fit and shall appoint a date for further hearing of the
application. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 106 provides that an application under Sub-
rule (1) shall be made within thirty days from the date of the order or where,
in the case of an ex parte order, the notice was not duly served within 30
days from the date when the applicant had knowledge of the order.
              Thus, the limitation period of thirty days provided under sub-
rule (3) of Rule 106 for making application to set aside the order made
under sub-rule (2) of Rule 105 is only where on the date fixed or any other
day to which the hearing may be adjourned, the applicant does not appear
when the case is called on for hearing.
10.           This Court in the case of Suka Mukhi V. Nata Mukhi &
others reported in 70 (1990) C.L.T. 776 held as follows:-
                    “…..A perusal of rule 105 makes it clear that
              dismissal for default at the stage of hearing is only
              covered under it. Only when an application is fixed for
              hearing or on an adjourned date of hearing dismissal of
              such an application, for default will be covered under
              Rule 105. If dismissal for default is at any other stage
              the same is not under Rule 105. In such cases, there is
              no scope for applying for restoration under Rule 106.
              Such application would be only by invoking the inherent
              power of the Court as there is no other provision for the
              same.”

                                       8
11.         At this juncture it would be profitable to refer to the judgment
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Damodaran Pillai and
others v. South Indian Bank Ltd. reported in 2005 (II) CLR (SC)-554 in
which the Hon’ble Supreme Court referring to its several earlier judgments
held as under :
            “9. The learned Executing Court allowed application of
            restoration filed by the Respondent herein on the
            ground that it acquired the knowledge about the
            dismissal of the Execution Petition only on 25.3.1998.
            10. The learned Judge, however, while arriving at the
            said finding failed and/or neglected to consider the
            effect of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 106. A bare perusal of the
            aforementioned rule will clearly go to show that when
            an application is dismissed for default in terms of Rule
            105, the starting period of limitation for filing of a
            restoration application would be the date of the order
            and not the knowledge thereabout. As the applicant is
            represented in the proceeding through his Advocate, his
            knowledge of the order is presumed. The starting point
            of limitation being knowledge about the disposal of the
            execution petition would arise only in a case where an
            ex-parte order was passed and that too without proper
            notice upon the judgment debtor and not otherwise.
            Thus, if an order has been passed dismissing an
            application for default, the application for restoration
            thereof must be filed only within a period of thirty days
            from the date of the said order and not thereafter. In
            that view of the matter, the date when the decree holder
            acquired the knowledge of the order of dismissal of the
            execution petition was, therefore, wholly irrelevant.
            11. We may notice that the period of limitation has been
            fixed by the provisions of the Code and not in terms of
            the second schedule appended to the Limitation Act,
            1963.
            12. It is also not in dispute that the Kerala amendment
            providing for application of Section 5 of the Limitation
            Act in Order XXI. Rule 105 of the Code became
            inapplicable after coming into force of the Limitation
            Act, 1963 (Act LVI of 1964).
            13. It is also trite that the Civil Court in absence of any
            express power cannot condone the delay. For the
            purpose of condonation of delay in absence of

                                      9
            applicability of the provisions of Section 5 of the
            Limitation Act, the Court cannot invoke its inherent
            power.
            14. It is well-settled that when a power is to be
            exercised by a Civil Court under an express provision,
            the inherent power cannot be taken recourse to.
            15. An application under Section 5 of the Limitation
            Act is not maintainable in a proceeding arising under
            Order XXI of the Code. Application of the said provision
            has, thus expressly been excluded in a proceeding
            under Order XXI of the Code. In that view of the matter,
            even an application under Section 5 of the Limitation
            Act was not maintainable. A fortiori for the said
            purpose, inherent power of the Court cannot be
            invoked.”
12.         In the instant case, Execution Case No.1 of 1988 was
dropped/dismissed on 24.8.2004 as no step was taken by either of the
parties. Now the question arises as to whether the date 24.8.2004 was
fixed for hearing of the application. For this purpose, it is necessary to
quote the order passed on 24.8.2004 and orders passed on some previous
dates in Execution Case No.1 of 1988.

                                                 C.J. (S.D.),
Dt.24.8.2004.      No steps taken by the either party since long.
                         None appears on repeated calls. Hence
the case                         is dropped.
                                              Sd/- S.N. Tripathy,
                             Civil Judge (Senior Divisions), Balasore
Dt.28.12.2009.     As per order dt.16.12.09 passed in CMA 46/05,
                         the Exn. Case is restored to file make
necessary                        entry in the concerned register. Put
up on                                   25.1.10 for further orders.
                                              Sd/- P.K. Patasani,
                                                C.J. (S.D.), Bls.”
13.         Thus, from the above orders passed on different dates, it is
amply clear that the date of hearing of the case was fixed to 24.8.2004 on
which date, the decree-holder did not appear for which case was dropped/
dismissed. It is only by order dated 16.12.2009 passed in CMA No.46 of
2005, the order passed on 24.08.2004 was set aside and the execution
case was restored to file. Therefore, it is clear that no application for
setting aside the dismissal order dated 24.08.2004 and for restoration of
the execution case was filed within the stipulated period of thirty days as
provided under sub-rule (3) of Rule 106 of Order XXI.

                                              11
                     In view of the order dated 16.12.2009 passed by the learned
      Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Balasore allowing CMA No.46 of 2005 is not
      sustainable in law.
      14.            This Court having held that the order passed by the Civil
      Judge (Sr. Divn.), Balasore dated 16.12.2009 under Annexure-1 is not
      sustainable in law, there is no need to deal with the legality of the order
      passed by the learned District Judge, Balasore on 22.2.2010 under
      Annexure-2 which will amount to mere academic exercise.
      15.            In the result, the order of the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division)
      under Annexure-1, the revisional order passed by the learned District
      Judge under Annexure-2, and the order of the learned Single Judge passed
      in W.P.(C) No. 4524 of 2010 under Annexure-3 are set aside.
      16.            The appeal is allowed. No cost.
                                                           …………………………

V. Gopala Gowda, C.J.             I agree.
