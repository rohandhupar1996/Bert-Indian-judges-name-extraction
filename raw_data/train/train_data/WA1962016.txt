                           IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT,

                         HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
                           HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
For the appellant:            Ms. RB Bora, learned Junior Govt. Advocate, Assam.
For the respondent:           Ms. M Dev, learned counsel.
Date of hearing & judgment: 15.6.2017
                                  JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        This appeal is directed against the order dated 29.7.2015 passed by the
learned Single Judge of this High Court, whereby he has allowed respondent’s
WP(C) No.3942 of 2015.
2.      The respondent while serving as Commandant of Assam Industrial
Security Force (AISF) Battalion No.1 and In-Charge District Home Guards
Commandant, Tezpur was arrested on 12.11.2012 for offences under Sections
120B/409/420/468/477 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13(1)(a)(c)/(2)
of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 vide case No.4219/2011 registered
at Police Station Tezpur. The respondent was ultimately released on bail after
more 1½ months. And since his arrest exceeded 48 hours, he was suspended
by the Principal Secretary, Home Department vide order dated 20.11.2012
                                                                          Page 1 of 3

from the date of detention. This order was passed under Rule 6(2) of the
Assam Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1964. On 10.1.2013, the
respondent made a representation to the Principal Secretary seeking
revocation of his suspension. As no order was passed on his representation,
the respondent filed WP(C) No. 7309/2013, which was disposed of vide order
dated 14.02.2014 directing the Principal Secretary to take a decision on it by a
speaking order within 15 days. Alleging that no decision is taken thereon, the
respondent filed WP(C) No.3942/2015 seeking quashment of his suspension.
The learned Single Judge placing reliance on Rule 6(2) of the Rules, 1964 has
held that there was no justification for respondent’s continuation of
suspension and quashed the suspension order dated 20.11.2012 with a
direction that he be reinstated in service forthwith. Aggrieved, the State has
filed the present appeal.
3.      Rule 6(2) of the Rules reads as under:-
        “6(2) A Government servant who is detained in custody, whether on a
        criminal charge or otherwise, for a period exceeding forty-eight hours shall be
        deemed to have been suspended with effect from the date of such detention,
        by an order of the Appointing Authority and shall remain under suspension
        until further orders:
                 Provided that where the detention is made on account of any charge
        not connected with his position as a Government servant or continuance in
        office is not likely to embarrass the Government or the Government servant in
        the discharge of his duties or the charge does not involve moral turpitude, the
        Appointing Authority may vacate the suspension order made or deemed to
        have been made when he is released on bail or is not otherwise in custody or
        imprisonment.”
4.      The above quoted Rule 6(2) makes it clear that a Government servant
who is detained in criminal charge or otherwise for a period exceeding 48
hours shall be deemed to have been suspended with effect from the date of
such detention. And as per the proviso, if such detention is not connected with
his position as a Government servant or continuance in office of the
Government servant is not likely to embarrass the Government or the
Government servant in the discharge of his duties or the charge does not
involve moral turpitude, the Appointing Authority may vacate the suspension
                                                                            Page 2 of 3

order in the event the Government servant being released on bail or is not
otherwise in custody or imprisonment.
5.      Admittedly, charge sheet has been filed against the respondent for
offences relating to Special Case No.4/2015. However, the respondent has
obtained a stay order in Criminal Petition No.3/2015 on the further
proceedings of criminal case. We are of the considered view that continuance
in office of the Government servant who is facing a trial for serious offences
such as cheating and corruption is bound to embarrass the Government for
the fact that government servant is a public servant and public must have full
trust in the Government servant whom they approach for redressal of their
grievances. The learned Single Judge overlooked this aspect of the matter
while quashing suspension order of respondent. We accordingly set aside the
impugned order and allow the writ appeal. We also direct the Registry to
immediately list Criminal Petition No.3/2015 before the appropriate Bench as
per roster for its early decision.
