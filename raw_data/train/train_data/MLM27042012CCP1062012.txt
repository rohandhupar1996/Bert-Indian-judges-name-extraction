CORAM:
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE M.L. MEHTA
M.L. MEHTA, J.
     1. The petitioner Nitin Gupta has filed his petition being Crl.M.C.
        3240/2009 assailing the order dated 21.5.2008 of the learned ASJ,
        whereby the maintenance of Rs. 8000/- per month granted to his
        wife Ruchika Gupta by the M.M. vide order dated 3.3.2008 was
        enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- per month.
     2. In the petition filed by Nitin Gupta, an order was passed by this
        Court on 2.12.2011, directing him to pay a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs
Crl. M.C. 3240/2009 & Cont. Case No. 106/2012                           Page 1 of 7

        without prejudice and subject to adjustment in two installments of
        Rs. 1 lakh each to Ruchika Gupta. On Nitin Gupta having failed
        to comply with the said order, his wife Ruchika Gupta has filed
        the instant Contempt Petition No. 106/2012 against him. Both
        these petitions are being disposed of by this common order.
     3. The brief facts necessitating the disposal of the present petition
        are that marriage between Nitin and Ruchika was solemnized on
        16.01.2005 and a son was born out of the wedlock. The relations
        between the parties were not cordial as a result of which Ruchika
        filed a complaint against Nitin under the Protection of Women
        from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the
        “DV Act”) in the Court of learned MM on 25.06.2007.
        Thereafter, she filed a petition under Section 125 CrPC before the
        MM claiming maintenance from her husband. The learned MM
        vide order dated 03.03.2008 awarded interim maintenance to the
        tune of Rs. 8000/- per month to Ruchika from the date of filing of
        the petition. A revision was filed before the learned ASJ by the
        Ruchika Gupta seeking enhancement of the maintenance amount
        awarded. The learned ASJ vide order dated 21.05.2008, enhanced
        the interim maintenance amount to Rs. 15000/- per month. Later,
        on the failure of Nitin Gupta to pay the interim maintenance
        amount, the learned MM vide order dated 14.08.2008 sentenced
        Nitin Gupta to 1 month civil imprisonment. Ruchika Gupta filed
        a petition for dissolution of marriage in the year 2008. Nitin
        Gupta preferred the petition being Crl M.C. 3240/2009, assailing
        the order of the learned MM dated 03.03.2008 awarding
        maintenance of Rs. 8000/- and further enhancement of the amount
Crl. M.C. 3240/2009 & Cont. Case No. 106/2012                 Page 2 of 7

        to Rs. 15000/- by the learned ASJ vide order dated 21.05.2008.
        This Court in Crl M.C No. 3240/2009 vide order dated
        02.12.2011, directed Nitin Gupta to pay Ruchika Gupta Rs. 2 lacs
        in 2 equal monthly instalments towards the arrears of
        maintenance. Nitin Gupta failed to comply with this order of this
        Court. Thereafter, Ruchika Gupta            has preferred a contempt
        petition, being Cont. Cas. No. 106/2012.
     4. The     learned      counsel      for petitioner   Nitin   Gupta      in
        Crl.M.C.3240/09 submitted that Ruchika Gupta has not shown
        any documentary proof which could substantiate her averments
        with regard to the income of Nitin Gupta. It is submitted that
        Ruchika Gupta has not been able to show any proof with regard
        to her standard of living in the matrimonial home and also having
        given a Honda City car. It is further submitted that though these
        facts have been duly recorded by the learned MM as well as the
        learned ASJ in their orders dated 03.03.2008 and 21.05.2009
        respectively, however they have erred in considering the same at
        the time of passing the orders. It is submitted that the learned
        MM and the learned ASJ failed to take into consideration the
        paying capacity of Nitin Gupta at the time of granting interim
        maintenance to Ruchika Gupta . It is contended that Nitin Gupta
        is currently working in Meerut at Marwari Bhoj (UP) and gets a
        salary of Rs. 3510/- per month and is thus unable to pay the
        amounts as fixed by the learned ASJ. It is further submitted that
        Nitin Gupta has already undergone civil imprisonment from
        14.08.2008 to 03.09.2008 due to his inability to pay the interim
        maintenance amount.

     5. Per Contra, the learned counsel for Ruchika Gupta submitted that
        Nitin Gupta has deposits to the tune of Rs.21.00 lacs.                     It is
        submitted that Nitin Gupta failed to comply the order of this
        Court dated 02.12.2011, whereby he was directed to pay to
        Ruchika Gupta Rs.2.00 lacs, without prejudice to his rights and
        also subject to adjustments, as towards arrears of interim
        maintenance, in two equal monthly installments and this amounts
        to contempt of this Court.
     6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
        records.
     7. This Court has in Rajeev Preenja v. Sarika & Ors 159 (2009)
        DLT 616 reiterated the guidelines as laid down in the decision
        of Gaurav Sondhi v. Diya Sondhi 120 (2005) DLT 426 in the
        context of an application for interim maintenance under
        Section 125 CrPC. The relevant guidelines read as under:
                 “The matrimonial courts should follow the following procedure
                while granting interim maintenance:
                (i)Whenever maintenance/interim maintenance is ordered, the
                Court will direct that it will be paid on or before 10th day of every
                month unless the Court finds that the nature of the employment of
                the husband and his manner of income makes such monthly
                payments impractical. In such a situation appropriate orders may
                be passed which shall take into account the circumstances of the
                husband which warrant departure from the time bound monthly
                payment directions contained in this order.
                (ii) whenever the wife has a bank account and indicates it, such
                payment may directly be deposited in such bank account every
                month before the 10th day of the month.
                (iii) The payment shall be made to the wife/child and in case of any
                difficulty in receiving or tendering the payment, it should be made
Crl. M.C. 3240/2009 & Cont. Case No. 106/2012                            Page 4 of 7

                through counsel. The order of deposit in Court needlessly makes it
                difficult for the wife to withdraw sums from the registry of the
                concerned court, apart from adding unnecessarily to the burden of
                the Court's registry. If for good reasons upon finding difficulty in
                payment to a wife and her Counsel the deposits in Court are made
                such deposits should be in the name of the wife by a draft/crossed
                cheques, which may be retained on the court file for retrieval by
                the wife without the time consuming process of deposit in the Court
                account and subsequent withdrawal by the recipient;
                (iv) In case there is first default for payment of maintenance, the
                Court may condone it. However, in case of second default without
                justification, it will be open to the Court to impose a penalty up to
                25% of the amount of monthly maintenance awarded;
                (v) In case there is third or fourth default, the penalty may go up to
                50% of the monthly amount of maintenance upon the court finding
                that the default was not condonable or contumacious in nature.
                (vi) The Court must ensure that the orders of maintenance are not
                a mere rhetoric and are meaningful and effective and give real
                sustenance and support to the destitute wife and/or the chilearned
                (vii) In case interim maintenance is being paid and adequate
                litigation expenses have been awarded to the wife, it should be
                ensured that the written statement/reply is filed within a
                reasonable time.
                (viii) However, in judging the nature of default the relative
                affluence of the husband and the regular nature of his occupation
                and income will be taken into account. Obviously husbands having
                irregular employment and/or daily wages or those having casual
                employment would be entitled to have their defaults viewed more
                liberally.
                The above directions are reiterated and it is expected that the
                learned MMs dealing with applications under Section 125 CrPC
                will ensue their compliance”.
     8. Further in the case of in Rajeev Preenja (Supra), it was held that,
                “19. Keeping in view the fact that interim maintenance
                applications are likely to take a year for being disposed of and
                that the payment to the wife is likely to be made only thereafter,
                it is only just and fair that the revisional court should insist on
                the deposit in Court of the interim maintenance payable in terms
Crl. M.C. 3240/2009 & Cont. Case No. 106/2012                             Page 5 of 7

                of the order under challenge as a pre condition to entertaining
                the revision petition. Otherwise a recalcitrant husband can,
                despite suffering an adverse order, defeat that order merely by
                filing a revision petition and not being burdened with the
                responsibility of complying with it.”
     9. In the present case, Nitin Gupta has even failed to deposit a sum
        of Rs. 2.00 lacs even without prejudice to his rights and subject to
        adjustment as towards arrears of maintenance as directed by this
        Court and further has tried to show his inability to pay the same.
        This order came to be passed in the backdrop of the fact that
        Ruchika Gupta had filed as many as nine execution petitions
        against Nitin Gupta for recovery of maintenance. Nitin Gupta
        unjustifiably did not comply the said order of payment of Rs. 2.00
        lacs despite the extension of time granted by this Court. There
        was no dispute that arrears of maintenance due from Nitin Gupta,
        and for which Ruchika Gupta was made to file nine execution
        petitions, were much more than Rs. 2.00 lacs. The non-payment
        of the arrears due and even the amount of Rs. 2.00 lacs by Nitin
        Gupta was nothing, but an open disobedience to the authority of
        law. The contentions of Nitin Gupta have been duly dealt with by
        the learned MM and the learned ASJ while disposing the petition
        of Ruchika Gupta for interim maintenance. This Court under its
        inherent powers ought not to dwell into these issues, as they are
        disputes over facts and have already been dealt with by the
        learned MM and the learned ASJ. I find no infirmity in the order
        of the learned ASJ or learned MM.
     10.In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and the fact that
        Nitin Gupta failed to comply with the orders of this Court,
Crl. M.C. 3240/2009 & Cont. Case No. 106/2012                         Page 6 of 7

        directing him to pay Rs. 2.00 lacs towards arrears of maintenance
        to his wife Ruchika Gupta, I am not inclined to entertain his
        petition being Crl M.C. 3240/2009.         The same is hereby
        dismissed. The Contempt petition filed by Ruchika Gupta being
        Cont. Cas.(C) No. 106/2012 is also dismissed with the liberty to
        Ruchika Gupta to pursue her execution petitions.
     11.The petitions are disposed accordingly.
                                                        M.L. MEHTA, J.
