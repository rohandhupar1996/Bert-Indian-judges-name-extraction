                        by the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission 1.
Reason:
      1 “State Commission”

                                                      2
              On 26 March 2013, the State Commission, in exercise of power under
        Sections 61 and 86(1)(e) of the Electricity Act 2003 2 issued a Tariff Order3
        for procurement of power from Wind Electricity Generators 4. Para 4.1 of
        the Tariff Order stipulated that it would be applicable to all new wind
        electricity generation projects commissioned on or after 1 April 2013 for
        sale of electricity to distribution licensees within the State of Madhya
        Pradesh. Para 5 provided for the “tariff review period/control period”:
                     “5. TARIFF REVIEW PERIOD/CONTROL PERIOD
                     5.1 The control period to which this order shall apply shall start
                     from 01.04.2013 and will end on 31.03.2016 (i.e. end of FY 2015-
                     16). The tariff decided in this order shall apply to all projects
                     which come up during the above mentioned control period and
                     the tariff determined shall remain valid for the project life of 25
                     years.”
              The tariff prescribed by the Order was (i) to apply to all projects which
        came up during the period from 1 April 2013 till 31 March 2016; and (ii) to
        remain valid for 25 years.
              Para 11 of the Tariff Order provided for the determination of tariff.
        Insofar as is material, it provided that the State Commission had set a tariff
        at the rate of Rs 5.92 per unit of generation from new wind energy projects
        to be commissioned after the issuance of the order for the project life of 25
        years. Para 11.2 is extracted below:
                     “11.2 Considering the above parameters, the Commission sets
                     the levelized tariff @ Rs. 5.92 per unit for generation from new
                     wind energy projects to be commissioned after issue of this
                     order for its project life of 25 years.”

                Under the terms of Para 12.4, developers were permitted to execute
          agreements with the Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company
          Limited5 before commissioning plants for the exclusive sale of electricity for
          a period of 25 years and the commissioning certificate was to form a part
          of the agreement.
                Para 12.30 provided thus:
                      “12.30 All existing projects i.e. projects commissioned before
                      01.04.2013 shall continue to be governed by the terms and
                      conditions applicable at the time of their commissioning.”
                On 10 November 2014, the first respondent applied for permission to
          set up a 12 MW project in Dhar District in pursuance of the Wind Power
          Project Policy 2012. The project was registered with the nodal agency.
          The registered capacity was subsequently enhanced to 15 MW comprising
          of ten wind turbine generators each of 1.5 MW. Final project approval was
          received from the competent agency of the State government for setting up
          12 MWs on private land on 2 March 2016 and 3 MWs on revenue land on
          10 March 2016. The first respondent acted on the basis of the project
          approval, completed construction and made the project ready for
          commissioning.
                On 17 March 2016, the State Commission issued a fresh Tariff Order.
          Para 4 which dealt with applicability of the Order and Para 5 which
          specified the tariff review period/control period were in the following terms:
                      “4. APPLICABILITY OF THE ORDER
                      4.1 This tariff Order will be applicable to all new wind electric
                      generation projects in the State of Madhya Pradesh
                      commissioned at 00.00 hrs. on 01.04.2016 or thereafter for sale
                      of electricity to the distribution licensees within the State of

            Madhya Pradesh. This order also specifies the terms &
            conditions (other than tariff) for captive user or for sale to third
            party.
            4.2 It will be mandatory for the distribution licensees to submit to
            the Commission, quarterly progress reports on the capacity
            addition, purchase of energy and other relevant details in respect
            of wind electric generation projects commissioned in their
            licensed area, and also post them on their websites on a regular
            basis. The SLDC is also required to submit through e-mail/fax
            immediately, a list of WEGs commissioned during the month of
            March 2016 i.e. from 00.00 hrs. of 01.03.2016 to 24.00 hrs. of
            31.03.2016.
            5. TARIFF REVIEW PERIOD/CONTROL PERIOD
            5.1 The control period to which this order shall apply shall start
            from 01.04.2016 and will end on 31.03.2019 (i.e. end of FY 2018-
            19). The tariff decided in this order shall apply to all projects
            which come up during the above mentioned control period and
            the tariff determined shall remain valid for the project life of 25
            years.”
     Para 11 of the new Tariff Order provided for determination of the tariff.
The tariff which was fixed under the earlier tariff order at Rs 5.92 per unit
was reduced to Rs 4.78 per unit:
            “11.2 Considering the above parameters, the Commission sets
            the levelized tariff @ Rs. 4.78 per unit for generation from new
            wind energy projects to be commissioned after issue of this order
            for its project life of 25 years.”
     Para 12.29 provided that:
            12.29 All existing projects i.e. projects commissioned before
            00.00 hrs. of 01.04.2016 shall continue to be governed by the
            terms and conditions applicable at the time of their
            commissioning.
     On 18 March 2016, a communication was addressed by the first
appellant to distribution licensees and generators stating that:
            Subject :- Issue of commissioning certificate for Renewable
            Energy Projects.
                                       ***
                     Procurement of Renewable Energy from Non-Solar RE
            projects, is being done by MPPMCL at preferential tariff till the
            issuance of bidding guidelines by Central Govt. Control period of
            most of the RE tariffs is being completed by 31.03.2016 and
            determination of the tariff for next control period are under

                                              5
              process. Looking to the financial year target and change of tariff,
              most of RE generators are trying to commission their projects on
              or before 31.03.2016. Tariff for the RE capacity commissioned
              on or after 01.04.2016 shall be governed by the tariff to be
              determined by MPERC. Therefore, it would be appropriate that
              while issuing commissioning certificate for these projects
              (especially wind based RE projects), status of actual capacity
              successfully injected power into the grid should be properly
              checked before issuing of commissioning certificate for the
              project.
                      In view of above, a format containing the commissioning
              details to establish the actual injection of power into the grid by
              particular WTG/Unit has been achieved, is enclosed. It is
              requested that concerning field officers may please be instructed
              to provide required information in the format and submit the
              same with commissioning certificate for the wind projects.
              Commissioning certificate for other Non-Solar RE category
              should also be prepared in the same line with the meter reading
              details to establish successful power injection into the grid by the
              RE plants.
                      It may please be noted that the commissioned capacity
              up to 31st March 2016 and after 31 st March 2016 will have
              different tariff and will be fixed for entire plant life. Any dispute
              regarding commissioned capacity would yield considerable
              financial implications. Therefore, to avoid any controversy,
              commissioning certificate should be issued with due diligence
              and responsibility.”
      A format for the commissioning of wind power projects was annexed
to the letter.
      Essentially, the letter took notice of the fact that since the tariff was to
change for projects which were commissioned on or after 1 April 2016,
most generators of renewable energy were trying to commission their
projects before 31 March 2016 to get the benefit of the higher tariff under
the earlier Tariff Order. Hence, it was specified that the “status of actual
capacity successfully injected power into the grid” should be verified before
issuance of the certificate of commissioning.
      According to the appellants, the then Superintending Engineer
(O&M), Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company Limited,
which is the concerned distribution licensee, issued a certificate to the first

                                              6
        respondent on 31 March 2016 stating that as of the date of the certificate,
        the project had been commissioned.          The appellants have sought to
        dispute the certificate on the ground that the commissioning certificate was
        not in accordance with the format attached with the guidelines dated 18
        March 2016, according to which the actual injection of power into the grid
        was the relevant criterion.
              On 1 April 2016, the first respondent addressed a letter to the first
        appellant seeking the execution of a Power Purchase Agreement 6 on the
        basis that it commissioned its project on 31 March 2016. The appellants
        dispute the factual contention that the project was commissioned on 31
        March 2016 and submit that the data provided by the State Load Despatch
        Centre7, which maintains accounts of energy transmission to the grid,
        shows that the injection of power into the grid took place for the first time
        on 1 April 2016. The SLDC was requested to confirm the status of power
        injected into the grid in respect of the project of the first respondent on 2
        April 2016. The data furnished by SLDC and its report for active power
        readings from 31 March 2016 to 2 April 2016 sets out time blocks during
        which power flowed into the grid. The data which has been placed on the
        record indicates the injection of three units in Block 1 as on 1 April 2016
        and, thereafter, injection commenced with Block 8 on 2 April 2016, going
        up to Block 16. Thereafter, the data indicates that there was an injection of
        power into the grid during the course of several blocks on 2 April 2016.
        According to the appellants, on the basis of the SLDC data, power was
        injected into the grid on or from 1 April 2016 and not before.              In

                                      7
consequence, the first respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the unit
rate of Rs 5.92 fixed under the earlier Tariff Order.
      On 30 April 2016, the first appellant informed the first respondent that
since its project had not been commissioned before 31 March 2016, it
would not enter into a PPA under the earlier Tariff Order dated 26 March
2013 under which the unit price was fixed at Rs 5.92. The letter, however,
indicated that if the first respondent signified its consent by 30 May 2016,
the tariff would be governed by the new Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016
for procurement of power from WEGs.            On 1 February 2017, the first
appellant informed the first respondent that if it did not enter into a PPA
under the subsequent Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016, which fixed the
unit price for power at Rs 4.78, it would not enter into any PPA with the first
respondent nor allow injection of power into the grid.
      The first respondent filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in order to
challenge the letters dated 30 April 2016 and 1 February 2017.           By a
judgment and order dated 21 September 2017, the High Court allowed the
writ petition and set aside the letters of the first appellant dated 30 April
2016 and 1 February 2017 and directed the first appellant to take
appropriate steps in accordance with the Tariff Order dated 26 March
2013. In other words, by and as a result of the directions of the High
Court, the first appellant was required to enter into a PPA with the first
respondent for the purchase of electricity at the rate of Rs 5.92 per unit.
      After the decision of the High Court, the appellant revoked the
certificate of commissioning dated 31 March 2016.

                                       8
      A review petition was filed before the High Court which was dismissed
on 29 January 2018.
      The revocation of the commissioning certificate gave rise to the
institution of the second set of writ petitions in the High Court in which, by
an interim order dated 15 May 2018, the revocation has been stayed. That
has given rise to two appeals before this Court.
      Appearing on behalf of the appellants, Mr. Nitin Gaur, learned counsel
submitted that:
(i)   The crucial provision for the application of the Tariff Order which came
      into force on 17 March 2016 is that it would apply to all new wind
      electric generation projects commissioned on or after 00.00 hrs on 1
      April 2016;
(ii)  The appellants had, by the guidelines dated 18 March 2016, required
      the submission of data in the prescribed format to indicate the actual
      injection of power into the grid so as to furnish an objective basis for
      determining as to whether the project had been commissioned before
      or after the cut-off prescribed;
(iii) As a result of the data which was obtained from the SLDC, it has
      emerged that the actual injection of power into the grid took place on
      1 April 2016;
(iv) In consequence, the first appellant offered to the first respondent that
      it was ready and willing to execute a PPA in terms of the new Tariff
      Order dated 17 March 2016 which was applicable to projects which
      had been commissioned on or after 1 April 2016;

                                      9
(v)    The first respondent failed to take the benefit of the offer which was
       made by the first appellant and instead pursued its writ petition before
       the High Court;
(vi) The High Court has erred in relying on the commissioning certificate
       issued by the Superintending Engineer, ignoring that the certificate
       was not in accordance with the format in which data was required by
       the first appellant for the purpose of establishing the actual
       commissioning of the project before 31 March 2016;
(vii) As a result of the subsequent developments, the first appellant is now
       bound by the guidelines which have been issued by the State of
       Madhya Pradesh on 1 August 2014. Moreover, under the guidelines
       formulated by the Union Ministry of Power in the Government of India
       on 8 December 2017, the first appellant is required to pursue a
       competitive bidding process for the purpose of entering into a PPA;
(viii) As a result of the PPAs which have been entered into by the first
       appellant following the competitive bidding process, it has been able
       to secure electric power at cheaper rates ranging between Rs 2.30 to
       Rs 2.59 per unit; and
(ix) The first appellant would now be willing to enter into a PPA on the
       basis of competitive bidding and having due regard to the interests of
       the consumers, it would be appropriate if the first respondent is
       directed to do so.
       On the other hand, it has been urged on behalf of the first respondent
in the appeals by Mr Vivek K Tankha and Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan,
learned senior counsel, that:

                                      10
(i)   Under the terms of the earlier Tariff Order which held the field for the
      period 2013-16, a rate of Rs 5.92 per unit was prescribed for all new
      wind generating units, which had been commissioned until 31 March
      2016;
(ii)  The rate of Rs 5.92 per unit was to remain frozen for a life cycle of 25
      years;
(iii) In the present case, in terms of the Tariff Order, which referred to the
      successful commissioning of the project, the first respondent
      commissioned its project on 31 March 2016 as evidenced by the
      certificate issued by the Superintending Engineer;
(iv) The High Court has not erred in directing the appellants to act on the
      basis of the certificate of commissioning and in staying the revocation
      which was issued only on 17 November 2017 after the writ petition
      was decided;
(v)   In the alternative, and without prejudice to the above submissions, in
      any event, there is no justification on the part of the first appellant not
      to enter into a PPA with the first respondent on the basis of the Tariff
      Order which was notified on 17 March 2016 for the control period
      2016-19;
(vi) The notification of the Union of India dated 8 December 2017 has no
      application since it applies to projects having an individual size of 5
      MW and above at one site with a minimum bid capacity of 25 MW for
      intra-State projects.

                                      11
(vii) The revocation of the commissioning certificate was a unilateral act of
      the first appellant without allowing an opportunity of being heard to
      the first respondent and no show cause notice was issued.
      The Tariff Order of March 2013 stipulated that it would be applicable
to all new wind electric generation projects which were commissioned on
or after 1 April 2013 for the sale of electricity to distribution licensees in the
State. The control period of the Tariff Order commenced on 1 April 2013
and would end on 31 March 2016. The Tariff Order fixed a levelized tariff
of Rs 5.92 per unit for new wind energy projects to be commissioned after
the issuance of the Order for a project life of 25 years.              Para 12.30
provided that all existing projects which were commissioned before 1 April
2013 would be governed by the terms and conditions applicable at the time
of commissioning. Hence, the crucial ingredient in determining the tariff
was the actual date on which the project was commissioned.
      The Tariff Order of 17 March 2016 which replaced the earlier Tariff
Order applied to all new wind electric generation projects which were
commissioned at 00.00 hrs on 1 April 2016 or thereafter. The SLDC was
required by Para 4.2 of the Tariff Order to submit a list of WEGs
commissioned during the month of March 2016 from 00.00 hrs of 1 March
2016 to 24.00 hrs of 31 March 2016. This data was sought in order to
provide an objective basis of determining whether a project had been
commissioned before the new Tariff Order became applicable to projects
which were commissioned with effect from 1 April 2016.
      In line with the above provisions, the guidelines that were issued by

                                     12
the first appellant on 18 March 2016 provided a format for the issuance of
commissioning certificates.     The format required readings of: (i) WTG
meters; (ii) main billing meters; and (iii) check billing meters. The format
required the submission of this data in order to establish the date on which
a particular project had been commissioned.              The actual date of
commissioning would determine the applicable tariff; the tariff of Rs 5.92
per unit would apply to projects which were commissioned on or before 31
March 2016, while the new rate of Rs 4.78 per unit would apply to projects
which were commissioned on or after 1 April 2016. Requiring the SLDC to
submit data of the actual injection of power into the grid was with the
objective of establishing the actual commissioning of the project.
      In the present case, the principal submission of the appellants is that
the data which was furnished by the SLDC indicates that the actual
injection of power into the grid by the first respondent took place on 1 April
2016. It is on that basis that the first appellant has submitted that the
commissioning certificate was not in accordance with the prescribed format
and had to be revoked.       Before this Court, the data which has been
furnished by the SLDC is not in dispute. Indeed, that is the basis on which
Mr Vivek K Tankha, learned senior counsel urged his alternative
submission that in any event, even going by the SLDC data, it is evident
that the power was injected into the grid on and from 1 April 2016.
      On reviewing the docmentary material on the record, we are not
prepared to accept the view which has weighed with the High Court,
namely, that the commissioning of the project was completed by 31 March
2016. The certificate of commissioning which has been issued by the

                                    13
Superintending Engineer is belied by the objective factual data available
from the SLDC which is a statutory body constituted under Section 31 of
the Act. The objective data on the record indicates that the injection of
power into the grid took place on 1 April 2016. Hence, we are of the view
that this should be the basis on which the claim for the entering into a PPA
should be founded.
      Since the factual data has been placed before this Court, we are of
the view that the project of the first respondent was commissioned on 1
April 2016 since the SLDC data indicates the injection of power into the
grid with effect from that date. On the basis of the commissioning of the
project on 1 April 2016, we find merit in the alternative submission which
has been urged on behalf of the first respondent in the appeals that the
Tariff Order that must apply is the Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016. The
first respondent was before the Madhya Pradesh High Court in writ
proceedings espousing its claim to the benefit of a higher rate of Rs 5.92
per unit on the basis of the earlier Tariff Order and on the basis that the
commissioning of its project had taken place on 31 March 2016. The first
respondent was bona fide pursuing its claim in that regard which found
acceptance in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court.
Though we have differed with the view which has been taken by the High
Court, we are of the view that it would be unfair to deny to the first
respondent the benefit of the rate which came to be prescribed by the Tariff
Order of 17 March 2016. The rate which was prescribed by that Tariff
Order of Rs 4.78 per unit was to apply during the control period beginning
from 1 April 2016 and ending on 31 March 2019 and that rate would

                                          14
continue to govern the life cycle of 25 years, as prescribed by Para 5 of the
Tariff Order. The first respondent cannot be denied a parity of treatment,
as has been allowed to other projects of a similar nature which would be
governed by the control period stipulated in Para 5 of the Tariff Order dated
17 March 2016.
      The competitive bidding guidelines upon which reliance has been
placed by Mr Nitin Gaur, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
appellants, were formulated by the Union Ministry of Power subsequently
on 8 December 2017.            Moreover, Para 3.1 of those guidelines is not
applicable to the project of the first respondent. Para 3.1 provides thus:
            “3.      APPLICABILITY OF GUIDELINES
            3.1 These Guidelines are being issued under the provisions of
            Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 for long-term procurement
            of electricity through competitive bidding process, by the
            ‘Procurer(s)’, from grid-connected Wind Power Projects (‘WPP’)
            having, (a) individual size of 5 MW and above at one site with
            minimum bid capacity of 25 MW for intra-state projects; and
            (b) individual size of 50 MW and above at one site with minimum
            bid capacity of 50 MW for inter-state projects.”
                                                    (emphasis supplied)
      The above guidelines apply to grid-connected Wind Power Projects
with an individual size of 5 MW and above at one site with a minimum bid
capacity of 25 MW for intra-State projects. Since the first respondent is
admittedly an intra-State project and does not fulfil the above requirement,
the guidelines (which in any event came into force subsequently) will have
no application.
      For the above reasons, we allow the appeals in part and set aside the
impugned judgments and orders of the High Court dated 21 September
2017 and 29 January 2018.             We direct, in consequence of the above
discussion, that the first respondent in the appeals shall be entitled to

                                       15
 the benefit of the Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016. The appellants shall
 process the application of the first respondent in the appeals for execution
 of a PPA on that basis with effect from 1 April 2016. In the view which we
 have taken, the second writ petition which has been filed by the first
 respondent before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh shall not survive and
 shall stand disposed of in terms of the present judgment. There shall be
 no order as to costs.
       Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
