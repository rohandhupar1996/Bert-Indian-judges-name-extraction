                               Review Petition No.10 of 2017
                             BEFORE
       HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
          HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
14.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr.BD Das, learned senior counsel, assisted by Mr. R
        Deka, learned counsel for the petitioner.
        Ms. R Bora, learned counsel for Respondent No.1, Mr. R
        Dev, learned counsel for Respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4 and
        Ms. P Chakraborty, learned counsel for Respondent No.6.
        By this review petition, the petitioner has sought review
of order dated 6.1.2015 passed by a Division Bench of this High
Court in WA No.82/2009.
        The petitioner, while working as Assistant Teacher in
Little Stars Senior Secondary School, Digboi, which is affiliated
to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), filed WP(C)
No.6010/2007 for a direction against the respondents to pay
him the scale and allowances as provided by the State
Government. Later, the petitioner was placed under suspension
by the respondents vide order dated 21.11.2007. He was then
subjected to disciplinary proceedings, which culminated into
passing of his termination order dated 29.3.2008. The
petitioner challenged the termination order dated 29.3.2008 in
WP(C) No.1409/2008. The learned Single Judge by a common
judgment     and    order  dated    22.11.2008    allowed  WP(C)
No.1409/2008 on the ground that disciplinary enquiry held
against the petitioner was not in accordance with law. The
learned Single Judge, therefore, quashed the order of
termination dated 29.3.2008 and remanded the matter for fresh
                                                        Page 1 of 2

departmental enquiry. However, the learned Single Judge
dismissed WP(C) No.6010/2007 holding, inter alia, that it was
not possible for the Court to recognize petitioner’s right to
receive salary as claimed by him. Dissatisfied with the judgment
and    order   dated   22.11.2008,     the  petitioner   filed  WA
No.82/2009, essentially, for the relief regarding payment of
salary as claimed by him. But the Division Bench of this High
Court dismissed the writ appeal vide order dated 6.1.2015 as if
the same was filed by the employer holding that enquiry
against the petitioner was illegal and approved the order of
remand for fresh enquiry. It is in this background, the petitioner
has filed the review petition.
        Be that as it may, after receiving notice, the respondents
have prepared a salary statement in respect of petitioner and
have also issued a cheque of Rs.7391/- in his name. The
cheque has even been accepted by the learned counsel for the
petitioner without disputing the correctness of salary statement.
This being the situation, no further order is necessary in the
review petition and accordingly it stands finally disposed of.
           JUDGE                                 CHIEF JUSTICE
