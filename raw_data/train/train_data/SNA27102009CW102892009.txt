S.N.AGGARWAL, J
        The respondent no. 3 is the widow of late workman Triloki Yadav
who died in an accident on 28.01.2007 in the course of his employment
while he was employed with the petitioner Shri Rakesh Mahendru.
2.      The     Commissioner,        Workmen's       Compensation,      under      the
Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, vide order dated 23.01.2008 passed
an award of compensation in favour of respondent no. 3 and thereby
awarded her a sum of Rs.3,32,580/- and Rs.2500/- towards funeral
expenses. The compensation awarded by the Commissioner, Workmen's
Compensation, was deposited by the Insurance Company (respondent no.
2 herein) on 29.01.2008 and the same was disbursed amongst the legal
W.P.(C.) No. 10289/2009 & CM No. 10154/2009                                Page 1 of 6

heirs of the deceased workman vide order of Commissioner, Workmen's
Compensation, dated 11.02.2008. Thereafter, on 12.03.2008, the widow
of deceased workman (respondent no. 3) had moved an application
under      Section     4-A    readwith      Section  22(A) of  the  Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923 for award of interest and penalty because of
default on the part of the employer in depositing the compensation
amount within one month of the date of the accident. The Commissioner,
Workmen's Compensation, (respondent no. 1) disposed of the said
application of respondent no. 3 vide his order dated 28.04.2009 and
awarded interest @ 12% per annum on the compensation amount of
Rs.3,32,580/- for the period of delay, i.e., for the period from 27.02.2007
till the date of deposit of compensation amount on 29.01.2008 which was
quantified at Rs.36,584/-.         The respondent no. 1 also awarded penalty
against the petitioner @ 50% of the principal amount which was
quantified at Rs.1,66,290/-.           The interest awarded vide order dated
28.04.2009 was ordered to be paid by the Insurance Company
(respondent no. 2) and the penalty amount was ordered to be paid by the
employer (petitioner herein).             It is aggrieved by this order of the
Commissioner,        Workmen's Compensation, that the petitioner has filed
the present writ petition seeking setting aside of the award of penalty
and interest inter alia on the ground that since the amount of
compensation          adjudicated       by     the   Commissioner,  Workmen's
Compensation, vide order dated 23.01.2008 was promptly deposited by
the Insurance Company within five days of the adjudication on
29.01.2008, the interest and penalty under Section 4-A readwith Section
22 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 could not have been
awarded by the Commissioner.
3.      The operation of the impugned award was stayed by this Court vide
W.P.(C.) No. 10289/2009 & CM No. 10154/2009                           Page 2 of 6

its order dated 22.07.2009 and notice was ordered to be sent to the
respondents. In response to the notice of this writ petition, an application
for vacation of the interim ex parte stay order dated 22.07.2009 being
CM No. 10154/2009 has been filed by respondent no. 3. In the course of
hearing on this application of respondent no. 3, counsel for both the
parties had agreed that the writ petition may be heard and disposed of
finally at this stage itself. I, therefore, heard the counsel for both the
parties in the matter.
4.      Ms. Pratima Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
respondent no. 3 had raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability
of the present writ petition.            It was contended by her that since a
statutory remedy of appeal against the impugned order is provided in
Section 30 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, the petitioner
could not have filed the present writ petition by-passing the statutory
remedy which mandates him to deposit the impugned award amount as a
condition precedent for filing of the appeal.
5.      Ms. Pratima Chaudhary had relied upon a Division Bench judgment
of this Court in Smt. Phuli Devi Versus Shri Jawahar Singh and Others,
[LPA No. 54/2009, Decided on 17.03.2009] in support of her argument
against the maintainability of the present writ petition.        Mr. Rajneesh
Sharma, counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner had no answer to
the objection against the maintainability urged on behalf of respondent
no. 3.     The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner had
simply contended that the writ Court has ample powers and can entertain
a writ petition even if statutory remedy of appeal is not availed by the
petitioner.
6.      I have given my anxious consideration to the above rival arguments
advanced by counsel for the parties on the maintainability of the present
W.P.(C.) No. 10289/2009 & CM No. 10154/2009                          Page 3 of 6

writ petition but on giving my thoughtful consideration to the same, I
have not been able to persuade myself to agree with the submissions
made on behalf of the petitioner.               It was not disputed by counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioner that there was a statutory remedy
of   appeal     available     to   the   petitioner  against  the   order   of    the
Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation, impugned in the present writ
petition.      Section 30 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 is
relevant and is extracted below :-
               “30. Appeals -- (1) An appeal shall lie to the High
               Court from the following orders of a Commissioner,
               namely :-
                      (a)    an order as awarding as compensation a
                             lump sum whether by way of redemption
                             of a half-monthly payment or otherwise
                             or disallowing a claim in full or in part for
                             a lump sum;
                      (aa) an order awarding interest or penalty
                             under Section 4 A;
                      (b)    an order refusing to allow redemption of
                             a half-monthly payment;
                      (c)    an order providing for the distribution of
                             compensation among the dependents of
                             a deceased workman, or disallowing any
                             claim of a person alleging himself to be
                             such dependant;
                      (d)    an order allowing or disallowing any claim
                             for the amount of an indemnity under the
                             provisions of sub-section (2) of section 12;
                             or
                      (e)    an order refusing         to register a
                             memorandum of agreement registering
                             the       same     or providing for the
                             registration of the same subject to
                             conditions :
                      Provided that no appeal shall lie against any
               order unless a substantial question of law is involved
               in the appeal, and in the case of an order other than
               an order such as is referred to in clause (b), unless
               the amount in dispute in the appeal is not less than
               three hundred rupees :
W.P.(C.) No. 10289/2009 & CM No. 10154/2009                               Page 4 of 6

                      Provided further that no appeal shall lie in any
               case in which the parties have agreed to abide by the
               decision of the Commissioner, or in which the order
               of the Commissioner gives effect to an agreement
               come to by the parties:
                      Provided further that no appeal by an employer
               under clause (a) shall lie unless the memorandum of
               appeal is accompanied by a certificate by the
               Commissioner to the effect that the appellant has
               deposited with him the amount payable under the
               order appealed against.
               (2)    The period of limitation for an appeal under this
               Section shall be sixty days.
               (3)    The provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation
               Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) shall be applicable to appeals
               under this Section.”
7.      A plain reading of the above statutory provisions makes it
abundantly clear that the order of the Commissioner awarding penalty
and interest could have been challenged by the petitioner only by way of
appeal in case the challenge against the said order involved a substantial
question of law.          The petitioner was also required to deposit the
impugned award amount of interest and penalty as a condition precedent
for filing of the appeal. It seems that the petitioner has filed the present
writ petition in complete disregard of the statutory provisions for appeal
contained in Section 30 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 to
avoid its liability to deposit the impugned award amount as provided in
Section 30 of the Act. A Division Bench of this Court in Smt. Phuli Devi's
Case (supra) has observed as under :-
               “Lastly, we feel that the writ petitions should not
               have been entertained in view of the statutory appeal
               provided under Section 30 of the Act. (see Rainbow
               Industries Versus Regional Director, E.S.I.
               Corporation, reported in (2001) 4 BOMLR 298,
               Executive Engineer Versus R.C.P. Rukman,
               reported in 1979 ACJ 73, M/s. Chowgule & Co. Pvt.
               Ltd. Versus Commissioner of Workmen's
               Compensation, 1970 Lab. I.C. 502 (Vol. 3 C.N. 119)
W.P.(C.) No. 10289/2009 & CM No. 10154/2009                           Page 5 of 6

               and K.L. Rathee Versus Municipal Corporation of
               Delhi reported in AIR 1995 Delhi 226. The said
               appeal can be filed on substantial question of law and
               cannot be entertained unless the memorandum of
               appeal is accompanied by the certificate issued by
               the Commissioner to the effect that the appellant has
               deposited the amount payable under the order
               appealed against. We do not think writ petitions
               should have been entertained when statutory right to
               appeal has been provided but restricted to only
               substantial question of law and that to on the
               condition that the appellant should have deposited
               the compensation awarded by the Commissioner.
               Lastly, appeal has to be filed within a period of six
               days.”
8.      This Court is bound by the decision of the Division Bench referred
above.       Since an equally efficacious alternative remedy of statutory
appeal against the impugned order is available to the petitioner, the
present writ petition is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed on
this ground.
9.      In view of the foregoing, this writ petition is dismissed as not
maintainable. CM No. 10154/2009 filed by respondent no. 3 for vacation
of ex parte stay is allowed. The stay order dated 22.07.2009 is vacated.
The parties are left to bear their own costs.
