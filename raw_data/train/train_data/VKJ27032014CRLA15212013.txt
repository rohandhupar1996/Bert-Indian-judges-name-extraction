HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN
                                               JUDGEMENT
V.K. JAIN, J. (Oral)
         The case of the appellant/complainant in nutshell is that the
respondent/accused took several loans from her from time to time, the total
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013               Page 2 of 11

amount of the loan given to him being Rs 10,40,000/-. This is also the case
of the complainant/appellant that the respondent/accused issued several
cheques drawn on Canera Bank, Raja Garden, New Delhi towards payment
of the aforesaid loan amount. The cheques, when presented to the bank,
were dishonoured for want of payment. After serving statutory notice upon
the respondent/accused, the appellant/complainant filed as many as nine
complaints against the respondent/accused under Section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act.
2.       The Trial Court, having held that the respondent had issued the
cheques in question in discharge of a debt or a liability and finding that the
cheques were dishonoured when presented to the bank and the
respondent/accused did not make payment of the cheque amount, despite
receipt of legal notice, convicted him under Section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act.
3.       Being aggrieved from his conviction, the respondent/accused
preferred appeals before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, who vide
impugned order dated 27.04.2013 held that the existence of a legally
enforceable debt or liability was doubtful and accordingly set aside the order
passed by the Trial Court and acquitted the accused/respondent. Being
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013 Page 3 of 11

aggrieved from the aforesaid order, the complainant is before this Court by
way of the aforesaid appeals.
4.       During her cross-examination, the complainant, inter alia, stated that
she had borrowed money from her sisters, namely, Anita and Rekha and had
also taken a sum of Rs 2.80 lakhs from Md. Zakir. She also admitted that
she was maintaining accounts with Indian Overseas Bank, Rajouri Garden
and Canera Bank, Raja Garden. Though she claimed to be an income-tax
assessee, no income-tax return was produced by her. In his deposition, the
respondent/accused Vikas Marwah admitted having signed the cheques in
question and giving them to the complainant/appellant. He, however,
claimed that the cheques were blank and were not filled up by him on the
date they were handed over to the complainant. He also admitted that the
aforesaid cheques were dishonoured for want of sufficient funds.
5.       Thus, in a nutshell, the case of the complainant/appellant is that she
had advanced a loan of Rs 10,40,000/- which the respondent did not return
to her, whereas the case of the respondent is that he has taken a loan of Rs.
3,00,000/- from her and he returned a total sum of Rs 3.5 lakhs, inclusive of
interest.
6.       Neither in the complaints nor in her depositions did the complainant
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013 Page 4 of 11

gave details of the loan which she claims to have given, such as the exact
amount of each loan, the date on which it was paid and the rate of interest
agreed to be paid to her. There is no valid explanation for not giving all
such details.
7.       Admittedly, the respondent before this Court is not the only person to
whom loan is alleged to have been given by the complainant. Admittedly,
the complainant had filed complaints under Section 138 of Negotiable
Instruments Act against Smt. Gomti Dutta and Keshvi Dutta. She claims to
have given loans to them.                    It would be difficult, in the facts and
circumstances of the case, to believe that she kept on giving loan to several
persons, despite not having enough fund with her, for this purpose.
8.       In her cross-examination dated 04.04.2007 recorded in CC
No.732/2009, the complainant/appellant inter alia stated that the sum of
Rs.5,80,000/- which she paid to the respondent/accused at one go was
arranged by her from one Mr Jacky and her sisters Smt. Anita and Rekha
Saini. She claimed to have taken Rs 1.5 lakh each from her sisters and
Rs2.80 lakh from Mr Jacky.                     She admitted that both her sisters are
housewives. She claimed that her sisters arranged the money by taking loan
from       one     Saini      Society       out     of     their  personal savings.       The
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013            Page 5 of 11

complainant/appellant did not produce either of her sisters or Mr Jackey, to
prove the loan alleged to have been taken by her from them. Therefore, her
deposition in this regard remained unsubstantiated. Even otherwise, it would
be difficult to accept that the complainant would have raised loan from
several persons, not for her personal needs, but for advancing loan to the
respondent from time to time. In the normal course of human conduct, no
one is likely to take obligation of others just to give loan to another person,
unless he/she obtains a substantial advantage, by undertaking exercise of this
nature. He/she would know that even if the person whom he/she lends
money does not return the loan amount, she would have to return the loan, to
the persons from whom it is taken. Therefore, he/she won’t take such a risk,
except for strong reasons.
9.       According to complainant, even her sisters had raised loan from a
society for advancing money to her. It would be difficult to believe that the
sisters of the complainant would have incurred liability towards a society, to
extend a loan to the complainant, not for her personal need, but for lending
that amount to a person who is stranger to them. Moreover, there is no
explanation for not producing the aforesaid persons in the witness box.
10.      In view of the facts & circumstances as discussed earlier, it would be
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013 Page 6 of 11

difficult to accept the case of the complainant/appellant that she had
advanced a loan of Rs.10.40 lakh to the respondent.               However, it is
respondent’s own case that he had taken a loan of Rs.3.00 lakh from the
complainant/appellant. According to the respondent he had returned the
aforesaid amount to the appellant/complainant. The alleged repayment is
sought to be proved relying upon a diary, a copy of which is Ex.CW1/DX.
The said diary is in the hand of the father of the respondent. Though the
case of the respondent is that the aforesaid diary bears the signature of the
appellant/complainant Kajal, there is no evidence to prove the alleged
signature of the complainant/appellant on the aforesaid document. In her
cross-examination, the complainant/appellant has nowhere admitted that the
aforesaid diary bears her signature. She only admitted that it was a diary
which belongs to the father of the respondent who was engaged in the
business of building material and property dealing. No handwriting expert
was examined by the respondent to prove the alleged signatures of the
complainant/appellant on the aforesaid document. Since, the respondent has
failed to prove that the aforesaid document bears signature of the
complainant/appellant, any reliance on it for the purpose of proving the
alleged repayment would be wholly misplaced.
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013   Page 7 of 11

11.      Had the respondent repaid the loan amount of Rs.3.00 lakh as claimed
by him he would have either taken a receipt clearly acknowledging the
receipt of the payments made by him from time to time or he would have
taken back the cheques which he had issued to the complainant/appellant.
The learned counsel for the respondent submits that since the parties had
cordial relations with each other and the respondent is residing in the same
house in which the complainant is residing he did not insist on taking the
cheques back from her.                I, however, find myself unable to accept the
submission.          The appellant/complainant did not extend loan to the
respondent without taking cheques from him. Therefore, the respondent
while returning the said loan would certainly have insisted on taking back
the cheques which he had issued to the complainant/appellant.
         In these circumstances, I am of the considered view that though the
appellant/complainant has failed to prove that she had advanced loan to the
extent of Rs.10.40 lakh, the evidence which has come on record clearly
shows that she had advanced a loan of at least Rs.3.00 lakh to the respondent
which he is yet to repay. Therefore, it cannot be said that the cheques which
the respondent had issued to the complainant/appellant were wholly without
any consideration.
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013     Page 8 of 11

12.      It is next contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the
appellant/complainant is a money lender since she had advanced loan not
only to the respondent but also to other persons, namely, Smt. Gomti Dutta
and Ms. Keshvi Dutta. He has also pointed out that admittedly as many as
24 complaints under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were
filed by the appellant/complainant, besides a suit under Order 37 of the Code
of Civil Procedure. In my view, even if the appellant/complainant was
engaged in lending money, that would not debar her from filing a complaint
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, if a cheque issued to
her towards repayment of the loan advanced by her is dishonoured by the
bank for want of funds and the drawer of the cheques fails to make payment
within the prescribed time, after receipt of legal notice from the lender.
Section 3 of the Punjab Registration of Money Lenders’ Act, 1938, which
applies to Delhi, to the extent it is relevant provides that notwithstanding
anything contained in any other enactment for the time being in force, a suit
by a money lender for the recovery of a loan shall, after the commencement
of the Act, be dismissed unless the money lender at the time of institution of
the suit is registered and holds a valid license or holds a certificate from the
Commissioner granted under Section 11 of the Act, specifying the loan in
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013  Page 9 of 11

respect of which the suit is instituted or if he is not already a registered or
licensed money lender, he satisfies the court that he has applied for such
registration or license but the application is pending.           The aforesaid
provision does not debar a money lender from instituting a complaint under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which is a remedy
enforceable before a criminal court, and totally independent of a civil suit.
The criminal liability is incurred only in case a cheque is issued in discharge
of a debt or other liability, the said cheque is dishonoured for want of funds
and the borrower fails to make payment of the amount of the cheque even
after receipt of a notice from the lender.
13.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order dated
27.4.2013, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge cannot be
sustained.
14.      In the facts & circumstances of the case, the respondent is convicted
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, in all the
complaints which are subject matter of these appeals. The learned counsel
for the respondent states, on instructions from the father of the respondent
who is present in the Court that if, the respondent is sentenced only to pay a
fine of Rs.3.00 lakh, in aggregate in all the complaints which are subject
Crl. A. No.870, 1520 to 1524 of 2013 and Crl.L.P. No. 348 of 2013  Page 10 of 11

matter of these appeals, the respondent undertakes to pay the said amount by
way of three monthly instalments of Rs.1.00 lakh each. Considering the
undertaking given by the respondent through his counsel, I am inclined to
take a lenient view, as far as the sentence is concerned. The respondent is,
therefore, sentenced to pay fine of Rs.3.00 lakh or to undergo RI for two (2)
years in default. The aforesaid sentence is cumulative for all the complaints
subject matter of these appeals. The aforesaid amount shall be paid to the
complainant/appellant in three (3) monthly instalments of Rs.1.00 lakh each,
falling due on 15.4.2014, 15.5.2014 & 15.6.2014.
         The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.
         The LCR be sent back along with a copy of this order.
