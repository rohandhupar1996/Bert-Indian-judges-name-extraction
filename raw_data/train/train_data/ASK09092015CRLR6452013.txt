CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
ASHUTOSH KUMAR, J.
1.       The present petition is directed against the revisional order
dated 3.8.2013 passed in Criminal Revision No.26/13 in connection
with CC No.70/1 whereby the order of the Metropolitan Magistrate
dated 15.2.2013 for registration of the FIR against the respondent
Nos.1 to 3 was set aside.
2.       The revisionist had filed a complaint bearing CC No.70/1/11
under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 12.10.2011
along with an application under Section 156(3) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure for offences under Sections 420/467/468/471 and
34 of the IPC against respondent Nos.1 to 3.
3.       The facts alleged in the complaint were that on 15.10.2010
Crl.Rev.645/2013                                              Page 1 of 8

respondent No.1 had sold a plot of land measuring 50 sq.yards situated
in khasra No.32, Janta Vihar, Mukandpur, Delhi to the revisionist. The
revisionist had paid a sum of Rs.1,05,000/- to respondent No.1 on
15.10.2010 and had issued a cheque bearing No.748356 dated
20.11.2011 for a sum of Rs.75,000/- as part payment.
4.       It was averred in the complaint that respondent No.1 was
initially not ready to accept the cheque but later agreed to keep the
cheque as security with a promise to return the cheque when cash
payment of the entire sale consideration would be made. The
petitioner thereafter arranged for entire balance amount of
Rs.1,85,000/- and went to the house of respondent No.1 for giving the
same to him. Respondent No.1 was not available at home. The
revisionist/petitioner contacted respondent No.1 on phone who asked
the petitioner to make the payment to his son i.e. respondent No.3 and
receive the aforementioned cheque which was accepted as security
and also to take receipt of the amount paid by the petitioner. Pursuant
to such a direction of respondent No.1, respondent no.3 received the
cash amount of Rs.1,85,000/- from the petitioner and handed over the
cheque to him. Before handing over the cheque, signature was
appended by respondent No.3 behind the cheque as a receipt of his
having received the total amount of Rs.2,90,000/- towards full and
final payment of the entire consideration amount. Thereafter, it has
been alleged in the complaint that the plot was handed over to the
petitioner who raised a boundary wall and constructed a room. This
was done before the execution of the conveyance deed.
5.       Respondent No.1, as alleged in the complaint, dilly dallied and
Crl.Rev.645/2013                                            Page 2 of 8

did not execute the sale deed. Several complaints were made to the
police but to no avail. Ultimately a complaint was filed under Section
200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure along with an application
under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C for offences under Sections
420/467/468/471 and 34 of the IPC.
6.       Acting on the aforesaid application under Section 156(3) of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, learned Magistrate, on 12.10.2011 called
for a status report from the police on such complaint.
7.       In the meantime, it has been alleged an FIR No.8/12
(P.S.Bhalswa Dairy) was instituted by the respondents under Sections
447/420/468/471 and 120B IPC. The aforesaid case according to the
petitioner was lodged only for the purposes of diluting the complaint
case filed by the petitioner against the respondents. The petitioner, had
to take anticipatory bail in the aforesaid FIR lodged by the
respondents.
8.       On 15.2.2013, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Rohini
Courts allowed the application of the petitioner under Section 156(3)
and directed for registration of the FIR against respondent Nos.1 to 3.
9.       A perusal of the order dated 15.2.2013 passed by the
Metropolitan Magistrate reflects the application of mind by the
Magistrate. The relevant part of the order of the Magistrate reads as
hereunder:-
       “Although there is one civil dispute going on between the
       parties, but it does not restrict the complainant to file a
       criminal case against the accused for the criminal conduct
       and offences. Therefore, keeping in mind the submissions
       made by the counsel for the complainant and after going
Crl.Rev.645/2013                                            Page 3 of 8

       through the entire material available on record, this court is
       of the view that prima facie it appear that cognizable
       offences in committed against the complainant. Therefore,
       the application of the complainant for registration of FIR is
       allowed accordingly. SHO concerned is directed to register
       the case FIR under appropriate sections and to file
       compliance report on 07.03.2013.”
10.      The aforesaid order of the Metropolitan Magistrate was
challenged by the respondents by way of revision before the learned
Sessions Judge (01), North, Rohini Courts, Delhi vide Criminal
Revision No.26/13.
11.      The Revisional Court, after recording the submission of the
respondents herein that the dispute was civil in nature and there were
no reliable witnesses of the factum of payment of Rs.1,05,000/- or
Rs.2,90,000/- by the petitioner as well as non consideration by the
Metropolitan Magistrate of the fact that one FIR No.8/12 under
Sections 447/420/468/471 and 120B of the IPC had already been
lodged against the petitioner by the respondents herein in which the
petitioner had to seek anticipatory bail, set aside the order of the
Magistrate directing the SHO of the concerned police station to lodge
the FIR as prayed for in the application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C
by the petitioner. The reasons which weighed with the revisional
Court was that the endorsement on the cheque (accepted as security)
was by Shoaib Ali, son of Hazrat Ali (respondent no.1 in the present
petition) who had to execute the agreement and the fact that FIR was
lodged against the petitioner at the instance of the respondents.
12.      The revisional order reflects that on mere denial of the
Crl.Rev.645/2013                                              Page 4 of 8

respondents of having signed on the agreement to sell and their having
filed a case against the petitioner in the first instance, the order of the
Metropolitan Magistrate directing for registration of FIR against the
respondents was set aside.
13.      Section 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as
hereunder:-
       156. Police officer' s power to investigate cognizable case.
       (1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without the
       order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case
       which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within
       the limits of such station would have power to inquire into
       or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.
       (2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall
       at any stage be called in question on the ground that the
       case was one which such officer was not empowered under
       this section to investigate.
       (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order
       such an investigation as above- mentioned.”
14.      Sub Section (3) of Section 156 empowers a Magistrate to order
a police enquiry in case the Magistrate does not himself issue process
at once. A Magistrate, if he has acted under chapter XV cannot
proceed under Chapter XII. This sub-section empowers a Magistrate
to order an investigation of an offence of which he may have taken
cognizance under Section 190 which he could have done even before
the examination of the complainant.
15.      In the present case, on receipt of the complaint and an
application under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a
status report was called for by the Magistrate. The status report, when
perused by the Metropolitan Magistrate gave him an idea that the
Crl.Rev.645/2013                                               Page 5 of 8

respondents were neither allowing the petitioner to enter in the jhuggi
nor were returning the money which was taken by them for which sale
consideration was accepted by the accused persons.
16.      It was only after being satisfied that a prima facie case was
made out against the accused persons that the prayer under Section
156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was allowed. The order of
the learned Magistrate does not reflect any illegality or irregularity.
The allegations levelled in the complaint petition clearly made out a
case of cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery for the purposes
of cheating.
17.      The revisional order is capricious and is based on a meretricious
reasoning that an earlier FIR in which the petitioner was made an
accused was already in existence and investigation of such FIR would
lay bare the truth. The revisional Court fell in error in accepting the
plea of the respondents that the agreement to sell was forged and there
was no witness of the payment of the sale consideration amount to the
respondents. The Revisional Court lost sight of the fact that in a
proceeding namely a revision against an order passed under Section
156(3), a verdict on the case lodged by the petitioner to be groundless,
could not be given. The reasoning given by the Revisional Court for
setting aside the order of the Metropolitan Magistrate is absolutely
unacceptable.
18.      It is beyond cavil that when there are rival versions with respect
to the same episode, it would normally take shape of two different
FIRs and investigation has to be carried out under both of them by the
investigating agency.
Crl.Rev.645/2013                                               Page 6 of 8

19.      A line of decisions by the Apex Court clearly elucidates that if a
concerned police refused to register a case, it would be open for the
Magistrate at any stage to direct the police to register a complaint
brought to its notice and investigate the same.
20.      A status report was initially filed indicating that the vigilance
branch of the police enquired into the matter and found that a forged
sale agreement was prepared by the petitioner. The status report
further revealed that the cheque which has been referred to in the
complaint was found to have been dishonoured due to insufficiency of
funds. It was in this context that the signature of Shoaib Ali,
respondent no.3 was obtained by the bank for the purposes of
encashment of such cheque. It was not an acknowledgement of
acceptance of Rs.2,90,000/- from the petitioner.
21.      The aforesaid status report is obviously wrong. The cheque in
question was not of the amount of Rs.2,90,000/-. According to the
complaint the cheque which was accepted by the respondents as
security was of Rs.75,000/-. Hence the endorsement behind the cheque
could not have been obtained by the bank at the time of presentation
of the cheque for encashment as the cheque amount was not for
Rs.2,90,000/-.
22.      The rejoinder filed by the respondents clearly repeated the
contents of the status report.
23.      Another status report was filed on 18.5.2015 in which it has
been stated that the signature of the petitioner was found to have
matched with the questioned documents as well as the specimen and
admitted signatures by the FSL.

24.      Thus the revisional order being absolutely devoid of merits and
being in teeth of the provisions of law is set aside and the order of the
Metropolitan Magistrate 15.2.2013 is restored. The case is remitted to
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate to issue further necessary
direction to the concerned police station for implementation of its
order, if the complaint lodged by the petitioner, on his request has not
been acted upon.
25.      For the reasons recorded, the petition is allowed with the
aforesaid observation
