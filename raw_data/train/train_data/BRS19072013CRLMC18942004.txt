CRLMC NO.1894 OF 2004
    4.   19.07.2013          Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and
                      learned Additional Standing Counsel for the State.
                             This CRLMC has been filed by the petitioner for
                      quashing the order of cognizance and issuance of process
                      issued against him by the learned S.D.J.M., Berhampur
                      in G.R. Case No.88 of 2000 for the offence under Section
                      409/34 IPC.
                             Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
                      basing on the audit report, the petitioner being the
                      Principal of Khallikote College, Berhampur lodged the
                      information on 04.02.2012, which was registered as
                      Berhampur P.S. Case No.12 of 2000, corresponding to
                      G.R. Case No.88 of 2000 of the Court of learned
                      S.D.J.M., Berhampur. He further submits that for making
                      out a case under Section 409,IPC, the cashier of the
                      College    is responsible  but  the   petitioner  who  has
                      discharging the duties of Principal as well as the Drawing
                      and Disbursing Officer of the College, the allegation
                      under Section 409,IPC is not attributable to him, but at
                      best he may be charged on the allegation of dereliction in
                      duty.
                             Having heard learned counsel for the parties, this
                      Court finds that this is not the appropriate stage to be
                      taken    into  consideration  and   the   same   is to  be
                      considered by the trial Court. Therefore, I am not
                      inclined to interfere with the impugned order at this
                      stage. However, I direct that in the event, the petitioner

        files an application for discharge for the offence under
        Section 409, IPC. The trial Court shall consider the same
        and pass necessary orders in accordance with law.
                With the aforesaid observation and direction, the
        CRLMC is disposed of.
               Interim order passed on 03.11.2004 is hereby
        vacated.
               Urgent certified copy of this order be granted as
        per rules.
