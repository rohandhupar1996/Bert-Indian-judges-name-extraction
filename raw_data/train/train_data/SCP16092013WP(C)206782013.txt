02. 16.9.2013               Heard learned counsel for the parties.
                            This writ petition has been filed challenging the
              inaction of the Sarpanch of Govindpur Gram Panchayat in not
              issuing the work order to the petitioner pursuant to the
              resolution   passed    in   the   Pallisabha   dated    12.04.2013
              (Annexure-1). It is stated that in this regard a representation
              had been submitted to the Block Development Officer, Tirtol
              dated 12.6.2013 (Annexure-3), on which the B.D.O., Tirtol,
              had directed the Executive Officer, Govindpur Gram Panchayat
              to issue work order in favour of the petitioner, if the petitioner
              has already been selected.
                            The grievance of the petitioner is that inspite of
              such order/direction of the B.D.O., Tirtol, no action has been
              taken by the Executive Officer of Govindpur Gram Panchayat.
                            Considering the submissions made and without
              expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, this writ
              petition is disposed of directing the petitioner to approach the
              B.D.O., Tirtol, with a detailed representation ventilating his
              grievances, who shall look into the same and take appropriate
              action in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible,
              preferably within a period of three weeks from the date of
              receipt of certified copy of the order.
                            W.P.(C) is accordingly disposed of.
                            Issue urgent certified copy as per rules.
