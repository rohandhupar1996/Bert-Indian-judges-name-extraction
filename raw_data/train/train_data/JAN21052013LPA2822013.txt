      HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH
JAYANT NATH, J.
1.    The present two Letters Patent Appeal Nos.281/2013 and 282/2013
have been filed by the appellant challenging the impugned orders dated
04.04.2013 and 22.04.2013 respectively. By these two orders, the learned
LPA No.281/2013 & 282/2013                                   Page 1 of 5

Single Judge declined to grant interim relief to the appellant.
2.     It is the case of the appellant that they had installed the modular gas
pipeline system at Sushruta Trauma Centre in 1996 and that since then the
appellant has been looking after the operation and maintenance of the plant
and manifold system. It is further stated that the contract for maintenance
ran from year to year and the last maintenance contract expired on
31.10.2011. It is further claimed that on 18.10.2012 a communication was
written to the       respondent that the appellant would discontinue the
manpower supply from 1st November, 2012. It is also claimed that the
appellant had complained to the respondent that the medical gas manifold
system had become obsolete and the oxygen flometer, oxygen probe and
oxygen control panel had turned faulty and required changes.
3.     On 04.12.2012 early morning an unfortunate incident of stoppage of
oxygen supply took place which resulted in causing death of four patients in
the ICU. It is pointed out that a Show Cause Notice dated 04.12.2012 was
served late in the evening whereby the appellant was required to show cause
by 10.00 AM next day morning. Subsequently, an order was passed on
04.02.2013 by Mr.S.C.L.Das, Secretary, (Health and Family Welfare)
whereby respondent communicated a decision to blacklist the appellant and
further debarred it from participating in any tender process/contract
agreement with any of the government hospital/health institutions of
GNCTD in respect of medical oxygen supply, for a period of two years
from the date of the order.
4.     The appellant thereafter filed the above-stated Writ Petition
No.940/2013 seeking a Writ of Certiorari for quashing of the abovesaid
LPA No.281/2013 & 282/2013                                       Page 2 of 5

order dated 04.02.2013.
5.      The Writ Petition came up for hearing on 04.04.2013 and in the
application for stay no interim orders were passed and the matter was
directed to be renotified on 30.07.2013.         The appellant filed LPA
No.281/2013 challenging the said Order dated 04.04.2013 whereby no relief
was granted to the appellant. Thereafter the appellants filed another stay
application in W.P.(C)940/2013, which was listed on 22.04.2013. On the
said date also no interim orders were passed in favour of the appellants and
hence second LPA bearing No.282/2013 challenging the said Order dated
22.04.2013 was filed by the appellant. It is the contention of learned senior
counsel for the appellant that the impugned order dated 04.02.2013 issued
by respondent suffers from material illegalities and is liable to be quashed.
It is contended that the Show Cause Notice dated 4.12.2012 has been served
on the appellants in the evening of 05.12.2012 and they have been directed
to show cause by 04.12.2012. Clearly, the whole proceedings had been
conducted with undue haste causing grave prejudice to the appellant. It is
further contended that the Show Cause Notice dated 04.12.2012 is not a
show cause notice for blacklisting of the appellant firm and merely states
that administrative legal action will be initiated against the appellant
company if show cause is not shown. Hence, respondent could not issue
impugned order blacklisting the respondent. It is further contended that the
person who signed the order dated 04.02.2013, namely, Shri S.C.L.Das is
not the person who was involved in considering the response of the
appellant to the show cause notice and hence the person passing the order is
nowhere connected with the opportunity given to the appellant to show
LPA No.281/2013 & 282/2013                                      Page 3 of 5

cause. Further, it is stated that the Show Cause Notice dated 04.12.2012
refers to some opinion of the Enquiry Committee. However, it is submitted
that copy of the Report of the enquiry committee has not been forwarded to
the appellant causing grave injustice to the appellant in filing its
reply/argument in response to the said Show Cause Notice. On those salient
grounds, it is contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that
the said order passed by the respondent dated 4.2.2013 is liable to be
quashed and hence the learned Single Judge ought to have granted stay of
the order in question.
6.     The learned senior counsel for the appellant also relied upon Well
Protect Manpower Service Pvt.Ltd. –vs- Delhi Development Authority &
Ors., 117 (2005) DLT 293 (DB) to submit that any order or decision in
matters involving civil consequences has to be made consistently with the
rules of natural justice. He also relies upon Oryx Fisheries Private Limited
–vs- Union of India and others, (2010) 13 SCC 427 to argue that by
sending a show cause notice the person who is subject to it should get an
impression that he will get an opportunity to rebut the allegations made in
the Show Cause Notice.
7.     On the other hand, learned ASG appearing for the respondent, has
contended that the blacklisting order dated 04.02.2013 has been passed on
account of serious lapse on the part of the appellant which resulted in the
death of four patients. Reliance is placed on the Report of the Enquiry
Committee, where learned ASG pointed out that as per the said Report the
appellant company apart from various other lapses had engaged services of a
person by the name of Amit Singh Katoch who was only VIIth class pass.
LPA No.281/2013 & 282/2013                                    Page 4 of 5

Hence, unqualified persons had been engaged to look after the maintenance
of life saving equipments. EPF and ESI have also not been paid to the
employees. Manpower had also been reduced from nine persons per day to
six persons per day for no rhyme or reason.
8.     In our opinion, the impugned order is a interim order and an LPA
would normally not lie against an interim order.         The various rival
contentions which have been raised by       learned senior counsel for the
appellant and the learned Additional Solicitor General are yet to be
adjudicated upon by the learned Single Judge. It is appropriate that these
submissions are made when the Writ is taken up for disposal. In view
thereof we do not see any reason to interfere with the orders of the learned
Single Judge. The appeal is hence dismissed. Pending application also
stands dismissed accordingly.
