S. K. SAHOO, J.           Heard Mr. Nirmal Ranjan Routray, learned counsel for
        the petitioner and Mr. Chitta Ranjan Swain, learned Addl.
        Standing Counsel for the State.
                          The petitioner Babuli @ Pradyumna Kumar Sethy has
        filed this application under section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing

                                   2
the criminal proceeding in G.R. Case No.146 of 2002 which
arises out of Tirtol P.S. Case No.55 of 2002 pending before the
Court of learned S.D.J.M., Jagatsinghpur.
             It  appears   that   on   09.03.2002     on   the  First
Information Report submitted by one Rabi Narayan Singh, J.E.,
Electrical Section, Tirtol, Tirtol P.S. Case No.55 of 2002 was
registered under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code against
unknown      persons.   During    course    of   investigation,  the
Investigating Officer found prima facie evidence against seven
accused    persons   including   the  petitioner   and   accordingly
submitted charge sheet on 31.08.2002 under sections 379/34 of
the Indian Penal Code. The learned S.D.J.M., Jagatsinghpur vide
order dated 17.09.2002 took cognizance of the offence under
sections 379/34 of the Indian Penal Code. On 03.01.2003, the
learned S.D.J.M., Jagatsinghpur framed charge under sections
379/34 of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioner and other
co-accused persons. The record reveals that two witnesses were
examined on 15.09.2003.
             Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the
petitioner is a Science Graduate from Utkal University and he has
got no criminal antecedent and the opposite party no.2 Babuli
Mohanty was granted bail by the learned S.D.J.M., Jagatsinghpur

                                  3
on 01.07.2002 in connection with the case and the opposite
party no.3 Sukanta Mohanty furnished bail bond for the opposite
party no.2. It is the further contention of learned counsel for the
petitioner that opposite party No.2 Babuli Mohanty after being
arrested, stated his name to be Babuli @ Pradyumna Kumar
Sethi (petitioner) before the police so also on the subsequent
occasions before the learned Court below and the petitioner
came to know about the said fact after one advocate of
Jagatsinghpur wrote a letter to him stating therein that the
opposite party no.2 had gone on bail in the name of the
petitioner and if the opposite party no.2 did not turn up, the
petitioner would be arrested by the local police as warrant of
arrest has been issued for non-appearance of the opposite party
no.2.   It is the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner
that the petitioner is no way involved in the case and it is at the
instance of opposite party No.2 Babuli Mohanty that charge
sheet has been submitted against the petitioner without proper
investigation.
             After hearing of learned counsel for the petitioner
and the learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the State who
produced the case diary, I am of the view that since the trial has
already commenced, the petitioner can very well bring materials

                                     4
on record before the learned Trial Court regarding his non-
involvement in the case and false implication at the instance of
the opposite party no.2 which shall be duly considered by the
learned Court below in accordance with law. At this stage, I am
not inclined to entertain this application under section 482 of
Cr.P.C. to quash the criminal proceeding.
                 Accordingly, the CRLMC application being devoid of
merits stands dismissed.
                                                    .................................
                                                     S.K. Sahoo, J.
