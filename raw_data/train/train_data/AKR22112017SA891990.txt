                                 JUDGMENT
    PRESENT:
                THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
    Date of Hearing:9.11.2017           &       Date of Judgment: 22.11.2017
Dr.A.K.RATH, J.     The defendant is the appellant against a confirming
    judgment.
    2.           The    plaintiff-respondent      instituted  the   suit  for
    declaration that the sale deeds are void, confirmation of possession
    and permanent injunction. The case of the plaintiff is that she is the
    uterine sister of the defendant. She is a pardanasin lady. At the time
    of marriage, her father had gifted an area Ac.8.900 dec. of land in

                                   2
mouza-Samapur in her favour. The land was recorded in her name in
the settlement R.O.R. published in the year 1962. The bhag tenants
were cultivating the land. The defendant was looking after the
property on her behalf. In the year 1980, the tenants created
disturbance at the instance of the defendant and proposed that the
land should be disposed of by sale. She agreed to that proposal. The
defendant brought the purchasers. On 28.8.1981 and 7.9.1981 a
series of sale deeds had been executed. She had also executed three
sale deeds in favour of the defendant without any consideration.
3.           The defendant filed the written statement denying the
assertions made in the plaint. The case of the defendant is that the
plaintiff is not an illiterate pardanasin lady. She hails from an
educated family. In the year 1980, she proposed to sale her property.
He agreed to purchase three acres of land out of the suit plot for a
consideration of Rs.15,000/-. The amount was paid to the plaintiff
on 5.5.1980 in advance, whereafter possession was delivered to him.
As the bhaga chasis’ created disturbance, execution of sale deeds
was delayed. On 27.8.1981 the plaintiff along with her husband
came to Samita Lodge, where the documents were scribed. They took
all the documents with them. Three days thereafter the plaintiff
executed 60 numbers of sale deeds including three sale deeds, vide
Exts.3, 4 & B in favour of him on 31.8.1981 and 7.9.1981. While
executing the sale deeds, the plaintiff was all along with her
husband. Plaintiff’s husband had taken active part in settling the
proposals and collection of consideration in advance. The plaintiff
also got independent advice of her husband.
4.           Stemming on the pleadings of the parties, the learned
trial court struck six issues. The parties led evidence, both oral and
documentary, to prove their case. The learned trial court came to

                                     3
hold that the sale deeds, Exts.3, 4 and B had not been executed by
the plaintiff after fully understanding the contents thereof. The same
were outcome of fraud practiced by the defendant. Held so, it decreed
the suit. The unsuccessful defendant filed T.A.No.10 of 1988 before
the learned Additional District Judge, Bhubaneswar, which was
eventually dismissed.
5.            The Second Appeal was admitted on the following
substantial question of law:
              “Whether in view of the categorical admission of the
              plaintiff and her husband that the sale deed was
              executed and the plaintiff had the advice of her husband
              at the time of executing the sale deed, the courts below
              are justified in annulling the same on the ground that
              the document in question was not read over and
              explained to the plaintiff.”
6.            Heard Mr.Debasis Chhotray, learned Advocate on behalf
of  Mr.Bijan Ray,       learned Sr.Advocate    for the appellant and
Mr.B.Sahoo, learned Advocate for the respondent.
7.            Mr.Chhotray,     learned    Advocate for  the   appellant
submitted that the plaintiff had admitted that she was depending
upon her husband in all her affairs. There was a dispute between the
tenants and plaintiff. The deeds were registered 3 to 4 days after the
documents scribed on 27.8.1981. The plaintiff executed the sale
deeds for legal necessity. She had received the consideration amount.
The plaintiff was always accompanied by her husband when the sale
deeds were scribed and registered. Her husband, P.W.3 admitted
that some sale deeds were scribed on 27.8.1981 and consideration
was paid. On 5.5.1980 he had gone to the house of defendant. D.W.1
(scribe) admitted that the deeds were executed by the plaintiff.

                                    4
8.            Per  contra,   Mr.Sahoo,    learned  Advocate   for  the
respondent submitted that both the courts below concurrently held
that the sale deeds executed by the plaintiff in favour of the
defendant under Exts.3, 4 & B are void. Ext.B was scribed on
28.8.1981. The date below the plaintiff’s signature in the document
is 31.8.81 and the registration has been made on 31.8.81. Thus, on
the date, the document was scribed, the plaintiff had not signed
thereon. He further submitted that the stamp paper, on which, the
document was scribed, was purchased on 31.8.81. The document
could not have been executed on 28.8.81. The stamp papers, Ext.3,
were purchased on 31.8.81. It was scribed on 27.8.81. The date
below signature of the plaintiff is 7.9.81 and it was registered on
7.9.81. The scribe has not explained the contents of the deed. Stamp
papers, Ext.4, were purchased on 31.8.81, whereas the sale deed
was scribed on 27.8.81. The document had been registered on
7.9.81. Therefore, fraud had been practiced while executing the sale
deeds. D.W.4, attesting witness deposed that he was not present
when the sale deeds were scribed. He stated that by the time of his
arrival, he found that the three sale deeds in favour of the defendant
and 4 to 5 other sale deeds had already been scribed. So, he cannot
say what was written in those sale deeds.
9.            Ext.B was scribed on 28.8.81. The plaintiff put her
signature on 31.8.81. The deed was registered on 31.8.81. When the
stamp papers were purchased on 31.8.81, how the same could be
scribed on 28.8.81 i.e., three days prior to purchase of stamp papers.
The plaintiff had not signed when the document was scribed.
Similarly the stamp papers of sale deed, Ext.3, were purchased on
31.8.81, but the same was scribed on 27.8.81. The plaintiff signed
the same on 7.9.81 and the deed was registered on 7.9.81. Stamp

                                     5
papers of sale deed, Ext.4, were purchased on 31.8.81, whereas the
sale deed was scribed on 27.8.81 i.e. three days prior to purchase of
the stamp papers. The plaintiff signed on the same on 7.9.81 and the
sale deed was registered on 7.9.81. D.W.4, the attesting witness,
deposed that he was not present when the sale deeds were scribed.
By the time he reached the sale deeds were scribed.
10.            On taking a holistic view of the matter, both the courts
below held that Exts.3, 4 & B had not been executed by the plaintiff
after fully understanding the contents thereof. The same were the
outcome of fraud practiced on the defendant. There is no perversity
or illegality in the impugned judgments. The substantial question of
law is answered accordingly.
11.            Resultantly, the appeal, sans merit, deserves dismissal.
Accordingly, the same is dismissed. No costs.
