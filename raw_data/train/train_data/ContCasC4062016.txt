                             JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
        Heard Mr. S.K. Kejriwal, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Ms. A.
 Verma, learned counsel for the respondent contemnor No.1 and Mr. B.J. Talukdar,
 learned counsel for the respondent contemnor No.2.
 2.     Land measuring 166.34 bighas of the petitioner’s tea estate was acquired by the
 state respondent authorities sometime in the year 2010. But as no such award was
 made in respect of such acquisition, during the currency of the earlier Land Acquisition
 Act 1894, this Court by its judgment and order dated 18.08.2015 in WP(C)
 No.2269/2014 and other similar writ petitions had issued a direction that as the awards
 were not passed prior to the coming into effect of the Right to Fair Compensation and
 Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Re-settlement Act, 2013, (in short
                                                                   Page 1 of 3

Act of 2013) therefore, the Collector, Tinsukia to pass an award in accordance with the
said Act, 2013.
3.      This contempt petition has been preferred by the petitioner on the assertion that
in spite of such order being passed no compensation has been paid to the petitioner.
4.      It is noticed that the direction of this Court in the judgment and order dated
18.08.2015 was to the Collector, Tinsukia to pass the award as per the Act of 2013 and
it was not a direction par se for payment of the compensation.
5.      The respondent contemnor No.1 has filed affidavit-in-opposition wherein, an
order dated 05.11.2015 has been annexed as Annexure 5 thereto. As per the said order,
the Deputy Commissioner, Tinsukia had submitted a revised award in L.A. Case
No.01/2008 under the L.A. Act 2013 and accordingly, a fresh award was prepared for an
amount of Rs.43,39,52,938/-. It is stated that out of the aforesaid awarded amount, an
amount of Rs.18,51,33,528/- had been deposited by Requiring Department, i.e., the
AIDC and out of the aforesaid awarded amount, an amount of Rs.17,85,15,688/- had
been paid to some of the land owners.
6.       It has been pointed out by Mr. B.J. Talukdar, learned counsel for the respondent
No.2 that the balance amount out of Rs.43,39,52,938/- which had been awarded by the
Deputy Commissioner had not been deposited by the Requiring Department i.e., the
AIDC and because of such reason, final payment could not be made to the present
petitioner.
 7.     It is stated by Mr. Kejriwal, learned counsel for the petitioner that by a
subsequent letter dated 06.02.2016 of the Joint Secretary to the Govt. of Assam,
Revenue & D.M. (LR) department, the amount of Rs.43,39,52,938/- which was awarded
by the Deputy Commissioner has now been reduced to Rs.33,09,66,713/-.
                                                                   Page 2 of 3

8.      In the aforesaid circumstance, this Court is of the view that the direction of this
Court in its judgment and order 18.08.2015 in WP(C) No.2269/2014 and other writ
petitions to pass an award under the Act of 2013 has been complied with by the Deputy
Commissioner.
        The reason for the petitioner for not receiving the payment is that the Requiring
authority, being the AIDC had not paid the full amount.
9.      In such view of the matter, the appropriate remedy for the petitioner would be
file an application seeking for a direction to the AIDC for making such payment and it
cannot be held that because of such non-payment by the AIDC, there is a willful and
deliberate violation of the direction of this Court by the Deputy Commissioner, Tinsukia.
10.     Accordingly, this contempt petition stands closed. Liberty is given to the
petitioner to file appropriate application seeking directions to the AIDC for making the
required payment and also to raise any such grievance against the reduction of the
awarded amount, as contained in the letter dated 06.02.2016 of the Joint Secretary to
the Govt. of Assam, Revenue and DM (LR) Department.
11.     At this stage, Mr. S.K. Kejriwal, learned counsel for the petitioner states that the
petitioners in the meantime had also requested for a reference and such reference has
been made by the Deputy Commissioner under Section 64 of the Act of 2013.
        As submitted by Mr. S.K. Kejriwal, the aforesaid grievance that the required
amount had not been received by the petitioners may also be raised by the petitioners in
such reference, if permissible the law.
