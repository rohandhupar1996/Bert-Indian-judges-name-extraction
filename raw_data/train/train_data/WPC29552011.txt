                         IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
           (High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh)

                                                                   ............ Petitioner
                                             - Versus –
                                     The State of Assam and others
                                                                    ........ Respondents
                                             BEFORE
                       HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.M. BUJOR BARUA
                      For the petitioner:        Mr. A.D. Choudhury, Sr. Adv
                      For the respondents:       Ms. M. Barman, State Counsel
                                                 Mr. K. Agarwalla, Sr. Adv
                      Date of Hearing :         13.06.2017.
                      Date of Judgment:        13.06.2017.
                         JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
              Heard Mr. A.D. Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. K.
      Agarwalla, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent No.5 and Ms.
      M. Barman, learned State counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4.
      2.       The respondent No.5 Modinagar Tea Company Ltd was allotted
      certain land by the Government for special tea cultivation and they are
      holding the said land for more than 50 years. The petitioner makes a
      statement in the writ petition that although the said land had been allotted for
      the purpose of special tea cultivation, but no such tea cultivation has been
      carried out and most of the land of the garden had been acquired by the
      Government for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.
      3.      Be that as it may, one Lekh Ram Agarwalla is said to have been in
      possession of 1B-3K of the aforesaid land under Dag No.73 of Chah Myadi
WP(C) No.2955 of 2011                                                            Page 1 of 4

      Patta No.1 of Geleki Bagan under Athkhel Mouza of Nazira Revenue Circle in
      the district of Sivasagar. It is stated that the said Lekh Ram Agarwalla claims
      his right as a ryot under the respondent No.5.
      4.      Subsequently, the said Lekh Ram Agarwalla sold the aforesaid land
      along with the permanent structure standing thereon to the mother of the
      petitioner vide registered Sale Deed No.2731 dated 03.11.1971. It is also
      stated that the respondent No.5 Company had also received its share of the
      sale consideration from the mother of the petitioner.
      5.       In the aforesaid circumstance, there is an order by the Deputy
      Commissioner, Sivasagar, by which mutation was granted in favour of the
      mother of the writ petitioner, namely, Smti Kamala Devi Modi. Prior to it, it is
      stated that a Katcha Khatian was also issued in favour of the mother of the
      petitioner in the year 1975. On the death of the mother of the petitioner on
      25.08.1994, the present petitioner by virtue of being the legal heir, was
      issued a Land Holding Certificate dated 20.11.1995 by the Circle Officer,
      Nazira.
      6.      At that stage, the petitioner preferred an application before the Circle
      Officer, Nazira for a mutation in his favour in respect of the said 1B-3K of
      land. Consequent upon such application, the order dated 08.08.2003 was
      passed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner, by which mutation was
      granted in favour of the writ petitioner.
      7.      The said order dated 08.08.2003 was assailed by the respondent No.5
      before the Assam Board of Revenue, which was registered as Case
      No.122(RA)(S)/2003. One of the ground on which the said appeal was
      preferred by the respondent No.5 was that the Additional Deputy
      Commissioner before passing the order of mutation dated 08.08.2003 had not
      afforded the respondent No.5 with any opportunity of hearing.
      8.      Although the learned Assam Board of Revenue in the said appeal goes
      on to decide the respective rights of the parties as regards the validity and
      correctness of the order of mutation dated 08.08.2003, but the core question
      as to whether the respondent No.5 was given an opportunity of hearing by
      the Additional Deputy Commissioner before the order of mutation was passed
      had not been considered by the learned Board.
WP(C) No.2955 of 2011                                                          Page 2 of 4

      9.      It is noticed that the learned Assam Board of Revenue went into the
      question that a Katcha Khatian was issued in the year 1975 in the name of
      the mother of the petitioner, but u/s 2 of the Assam Temporarily Settled
      Areas (Tenancy) Act, 1971, no tenancy can be allowed in respect of the land
      of special cultivation. The learned Assam Board of Revenue further goes into
      the question that although Lekh Ram Agarwalla was the absolute and
      exclusive owner and possessor of the disputed land on the strength of a Sale
      Deed No.2731 dated 03.11.1971, but Lekh Ram Agarwalla was neither a
      recorded pattadar of the land nor an authorized representative of the
      respondent No.5 Company and as such he did not have any authority to
      transfer the disputed land to the mother of the petitioner.
      10.     The learned Assam Board of Revenue also goes into the question that
      the order dated 08.08.2003 was passed by the Deputy Commissioner without
      examining the specific provisions of the Assam Temporarily Settled Areas
      (Tenancy) Act, 1971 and the other relevant laws applicable in case of transfer
      of land. Accordingly, by the judgment and order dated 24.01.2011, the order
      of mutation dated 08.08.2003 was set aside.
      11.      In order to sustain the aforesaid view expressed by the learned
      Assam Board of Revenue, a factual determination as to whether the aforesaid
      Lekh Ram Agarwalla was a ryot under the respondent No.5 Company would
      necessarily have to be made. Only upon a definite finding of the said question
      of fact, the subsequent applicability of the Assam Temporarily Settled Areas
      (Tenancy) Act, 1971 can be determined. In the absence of such
      determination, this Court is of the view that for the present, the aforesaid
      findings of the learned Assam Board of Revenue be not held to be applicable
      and binding in respect of either of the parties.
      12.     As the matter requires a factual determination as to whether the
      aforesaid Lekh Ram Agarwalla was a ryot or not, it is deemed appropriate that
      the matter be remanded back to the Deputy Commissioner for its appropriate
      adjudication. The aforesaid view to remand the matter back to the Deputy
      Commissioner would also be consistent in view of the fact that while issuing
      the order of mutation dated 08.08.2003, the respondent No.5 Company was
      not issued any notice and neither they were given an opportunity of hearing.
WP(C) No.2955 of 2011                                                         Page 3 of 4

      13.     In this respect, reference is to be made to the provisions of Section 52
      of the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886, which provides for the
      procedure to be followed on an application for registration.
      14.     Section 52 clearly provides that on receiving an application u/s 50 or
      51, the Deputy Commissioner shall, if he considers that there are sufficient
      ground for proceeding with the application, publish a notice requiring all
      persons, who desires to object to the registration of the name of the applicant
      to prefer a written statement of their objections and appear on the specific
      date as stated in the notice. The aforesaid provisions of Section 52 of the
      Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886 is clearly a statutory requirement
      and makes it mandatory for the Deputy Commissioner to publish a notice
      inviting objections from all such persons, who may object to such registration.
      15.     In the instant case, it is found that before issuing the order dated
      08.08.2003, no such notice was published and nor any opportunity was given
      to the respondent No.5 Company to raise its objection. In view of both the
      reasons as aforesaid, this Court deems it appropriate that the matter be
      remanded back to the Deputy Commissioner for a fresh adjudication as to
      whether an order of mutation is required to be issued in favour of the
      petitioner and in doing so, and also as required u/s 52 of the Assam Land and
      Revenue Regulation, 1886, appropriate notices be issued to the respondent
      No.5 Company for preferring their objection to it.
      16.     It is also provided that while hearing the objection, if the Deputy
      Commissioner is of the view that a dispute exists between the parties, the
      matter may be referred for a formal enquiry in a Court as provided in Note-1
      to Section 53A of the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886.
              In terms of the above, the writ petition stands closed.
                                                                            JUDGE
