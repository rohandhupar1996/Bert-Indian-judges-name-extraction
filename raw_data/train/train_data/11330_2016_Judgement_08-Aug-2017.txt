Reason:
             was conveyed with the adverse entry in his Annual Confidential

                                   2
Report for the year 2003-2004 on 30.10.2004.            He sought a
clarification from the Registrar (Vigilance) as to whether the
aforesaid remarks were advisory or adverse in nature. The
respondent vide letter dated 1.12.2004 conveyed that the remark
in column No.13 against him was ‘adverse’ whereas the remark in
column     No.14   was   ‘advisory’   in nature.    After  prolonged
correspondence, the respondent conveyed to the appellant vide
letter dated 5.3.2005 that upon consideration of the entire
matter, the Full Court felt that the adverse entry in column No.13
was not specifically relatable to any particular record nor it had
any specific genesis of particular record of his service.
3.    As per the gradation list of Himachal Pradesh Judicial Service
as it stood on 1.1.2005, the date of retirement of the appellant
was shown as 31.7.2007 on which date he completed the age of
60 years as provided under Rule 14 of the Himachal Pradesh
Judicial Service Rules, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the
Rules’).    The High Court issued a notification at Annexure P-16
dated 20.4.2005 holding that the appellant stands retired from
service with effect from the afternoon of 31.7.2005, i.e. the last

                                       3
day of the month in which he attains the age of superannuation,
i.e. 58 years under proviso to Rule 14 of the Rules. The said
Notification is as under:
            “HIGH COURT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, SHIMLA-171001
            HHC/GAZ/14-46/74-IV         Dated Shimla April 20, 2005.
                                  NOTIFICATION
            Hon’ble the Chief Justice and Hon’ble Judges of the High
            Court of Himachal Pradesh are pleased to order that Shri
            P.D. Goel, District and Sessions Judge, Chamba (a Member
            of Himachal Pradesh Judicial Service), shall stand retired
            from service on and with effect from the afternoon of 31 st
            July, 2005 i.e. last day of the month in which he attains
            the age of superannuation, that is, 58 years, under Rule 14
            of Himachal Pradesh Judicial Service Rules, 2004.
                                     BY ORDER OF THE HON’BLE HIGH
                                     COURT OF H.P.
                                     REGISTRAR GENERAL
     Endst. No. HHC/GAZ/14-46/74-IV-         Dated: 20.04.2005”
4.    The appellant filed C.W.P. No.649/2005 challenging the
notification before the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla.
The learned Single Judge vide order dated 9.1.2009 struck down
the adverse entry made in the Annual Confidential Report. It was
held that retiring the appellant at the age of 58 years vide order
dated 20.4.2005 is contrary to law. It was further held that the
order had not been passed by the appointing authority, viz. the

                                4
Governor of State of Himachal Pradesh. The learned Single Judge
further held that the appellant is entitled to all consequential
benefits.
5.    The respondent challenged the order of the learned Single
Judge by filing Letters Patent Appeal, being LPA No.34 of 2009,
before the Division Bench. The Division Bench vide order dated
31.12.2015 did not agree with the order of the learned Single
Judge striking down the adverse entry made in the Annual
Confidential Report. The Division Bench held that the Governor
alone has the power to pass an order of dismissal, removal or
termination on the recommendation of the High Court which is
made in exercise of powers of control vested in the High Court
and that the High Court cannot dismiss, remove or terminate the
services of the District Judge.   It was further held that the
notification Annexure P-16 has to be treated as recommendation
of the High Court to the Governor for removal of services of the
appellant and the Governor has to proceed and make necessary
consequential order in accordance with the recommendations of
the High Court. Accordingly the appeal was disposed of.

                                  5
6.   Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing for the
appellant submits that the Governor of the Himachal Pradesh is
the appointing authority who alone could retire the appellant, that
too in public interest after forming an opinion and after giving a
notice of three months to the appellant and that the High Court is
only recommending authority in that respect. The Governor has
not passed an order retiring the appellant at the age of 58 years.
The appellant has attained the age of superannuation on
31.7.2007. Therefore, he is entitled for all the service benefits till
the date of attaining the age of superannuation.
7.   Ms. Pragati Neekhra, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent submits that in terms of the direction of the Division
Bench, the Governor of Himachal Pradesh has passed an order on
31.1.2017 retiring the appellant with effect from the afternoon of
31.7.2005, i.e. the last day of the month in which he attains the
age of superannuation, i.e. 58 years.      Therefore, it cannot be
said that the appellant has retired on attaining the age of
superannuation at 60 years.

                                  6
8.    Having regard to the contentions urged, the only question
for consideration is whether retiring the appellant retrospectively
on completing the age of 58 years is justified in law.
9.    This Court in Registrar (Admn.), High Court of Orissa,
Cuttack vs. Sisir Kanta Satapathy (Dead) by LRs. and Anr.
(1999) 7 SCC 725, while considering the scope of Articles 233,
234 and 235 of the Constitution of India has held that the control
vested in the High Court over the subordinate judiciary though
absolute and exclusive, has to be exercised without usurping the
power vested in the executive under the Constitution. The High
Court   retains  the  power    of   disciplinary control  over  the
subordinate judiciary, including the power to initiate disciplinary
proceedings,    suspend   them    pending     enquiry  and  impose
punishment on them. But when it comes to the question of
dismissal, removal, reduction in rank or termination of judicial
officers on any count whatsoever, the High Court becomes only
the recommending authority and cannot itself pass such an order.
The High Court has to send its recommendations to the Governor

                                7
because the Governor is the authority to dismiss, remove, reduce
in rank or terminate the appointment.
10. In the instant case, the appellant had not been retired by
the appointing authority, namely, the Governor of Himachal
Pradesh. Therefore, it cannot be said that the appellant had
retired on the completion of age of 58 years. Instead of quashing
the notification at Annexure P-16, the Division Bench treated the
said notification as recommendation of the High Court to the
Governor for removal of the services of the appellant. This order
was passed after the appellant had completed the age of 60
years. In terms of the order of the Division Bench, the Governor
has passed an order dated 31.1.2017 retrospectively retiring the
appellant with effect from 31.7.2005, which, in our view, is not
permissible in law. The Himachal Pradesh Judicial Service Rules,
2004 do not provide for retrospectively retiring the judicial
officers. The order of the High Court retiring the appellant at the
age of 58 years cannot take effect as it was without authority of
law. It only means that the appellant has to be treated to have

                                  8
been retired from service on completion of 60 years of age on
31.7.2007.
11. We are of the view that the order of the Division Bench
treating the recommendation of the High Court to the Governor
for compulsorily retiring the appellant cannot be sustained. The
order of the Division Bench to that extent is hereby set aside.
Consequently, the order of the Governor dated 31.1.2017 is also
set aside. The appellant is entitled to his salary, allowances and
all other consequential benefits till 31.7.2007. The arrears as per
above terms shall be paid to the appellant within three months
from the date of receipt of copy of this judgment. The appeal is
accordingly allowed.
12. There will be no order as to costs.
