         HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL
G.S.SISTANI, J. (ORAL)
1.       Counsel for the petitioner, at the outset, submits that inadvertently
         Khasra no.116 has been mentioned in the writ petition, he restricts his
         prayer to Khasra no.115, measuring 4 bighas 4 biswas and Khasra
         no.117, measuring 4 bighas and 16 biswas, situated in the revenue
         estate of village Sayoorpur, Tehsil Hauz Khas, New Delhi (hereinafter
         referred to as the „subject land‟).
2.       This is a petition under Article 226 of Constitution of India filed by
         the petitioner seeking a declaration that the acquisition proceedings
         with respect to the subject land stand lapsed in view of section 24(2)
         of Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
W.P. (C) No.11/2015
                                                                          Page 1 of 7

         Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as
         „2013 Act‟) as compensation has not been paid to the petitioner.
3.       In this case, a notification under section 4 of Land Acquisition Act,
         1894 (hereinafter referred to as „Act‟) was issued on 25.11.1980 and a
         declaration under section 6 was made on 20.05.1987. Thereafter, an
         award bearing no.10-87-88 was passed on 14.07.1987.
4.       Counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention of the Court to the
         counter affidavit filed by LAC wherein it has been categorically stated
         that the compensation has been sent in RD. Counsel further submits
         that since the compensation has not been tendered to the petitioner, the
         case of the petitioner would be fully covered by Pune Municipal
         Corporation & Anr. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki & ors.,
         reported at (2014) 3 SCC 183.
5.       Mr.Jain, learned counsel for LAC submits that the possession of the
         subject land was taken on 14.07.1987. Para 7 of counter affidavit filed
         by LAC reads as under :-
                  “7. That it is submitted that the lands of village
                  Sayoorpur were notified vide Notification under section 4
                  of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 dated 25.11.1980
                  which was followed by the Notification under section 6
                  of the Act dated 15.5.1985. The Award was also passed
                  vide Award No.10/87-88 dated 19.5.87 and the
                  possession of the lands were taken on 14.7.1987 and
                  further handed over to the requisition agency i.e. DDA on
                  the spot, the very same day after preparing necessary
                  documents such as Possession Proceedings. It is
                  submitted that the compensation for Khasra Nos.115 and
                  117 has been sent in RD, whereas, the compensation for
                  Khasra No.116 was deposited in Court in CM (M)
                  No.1407/2013.”
W.P. (C) No.11/2015
                                                                        Page 2 of 7

6.       We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Taking into
         consideration the submissions made and the categorical assertion
         made in the counter affidavit filed by LAC that the compensation was
         sent to RD, we are of the view that the case of the petitioner is fully
         covered by the decision rendered by the Apex Court in the case of
         Pune Municipal Corporation & another (supra), wherein, it has been
         held in paras 14 to 20 as under :-
               “14. Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act enjoins upon the
              Collector, on making an award under Section 11, to tender
              payment of compensation to persons interested entitled
              thereto according to award. It further mandates the Collector
              to make payment of compensation to them unless prevented
              by one of the contingencies contemplated in sub-section (2).
              The contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2) are: (i) the
              persons interested entitled to compensation do not consent
              to receive it (ii) there is no person competent to alienate the
              land and (iii) there is dispute as to the title to receive
              compensation or as to the apportionment of it. If due to any
              of the contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2), the
              Collector is prevented from making payment of
              compensation to the persons interested who are entitled to
              compensation, then the Collector is required to deposit the
              compensation in the court to which reference under Section
              18 may be made.
              15. Simply put, Section 31 of the 1894 Act makes provision
              for payment of compensation or deposit of the same in the
              court. This provision requires that the Collector should
              tender payment of compensation as awarded by him to the
              persons interested who are entitled to compensation. If due
              to happening of any contingency as contemplated
              in Section 31(2), the compensation has not been paid, the
              Collector should deposit the amount of compensation in the
              court to which reference can be made under Section 18.
              16. The mandatory nature of the provision in Section
              31(2) with regard to deposit of the compensation in the
W.P. (C) No.11/2015
                                                                         Page 3 of 7

              court is further fortified by the provisions contained
              in Sections 32, 33 and 34. As a matter of fact, Section
              33 gives power to the court, on an application by a person
              interested or claiming an interest in such money, to pass an
              order to invest the amount so deposited in such government
              or other approved securities and may direct the interest or
              other proceeds of any such investment to be accumulated
              and paid in such manner as it may consider proper so that
              the parties interested therein may have the benefit therefrom
              as they might have had from the land in respect whereof
              such money shall have been deposited or as near thereto as
              may be.
              17. While enacting Section 24(2), Parliament definitely had
              in its view Section 31 of the 1894 Act. From that one thing
              is clear that it did not intend to equate the word “paid” to
              “offered” or “tendered”. But at the same time, we do not
              think that by use of the word “paid”, Parliament intended
              receipt of compensation by the landowners/persons
              interested. In our view, it is not appropriate to give a literal
              construction to the expression “paid” used in this sub-
              section (sub-section (2) of Section 24). If a literal
              construction were to be given, then it would amount to
              ignoring procedure, mode and manner of deposit provided
              in Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act in the event of happening
              of any of the contingencies contemplated therein which may
              prevent the Collector from making actual payment of
              compensation. We are of the view, therefore, that for the
              purposes of Section 24(2), the compensation shall be
              regarded as “paid” if the compensation has been offered to
              the person interested and such compensation has been
              deposited in the court where reference under Section 18 can
              be made on happening of any of the contingencies
              contemplated under Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act. In other
              words, the compensation may be said to have been “paid”
              within the meaning of Section 24(2) when the Collector (or
              for that matter Land Acquisition Officer) has discharged his
              obligation and deposited the amount of compensation in
              court and made that amount available to the interested
              person to be dealt with as provided in Sections 32 and 33.
W.P. (C) No.11/2015
                                                                          Page 4 of 7

              18. 1894 Act being an expropriatory legislation has to be
              strictly followed. The procedure, mode and manner for
              payment of compensation are prescribed in Part V (Sections
              31-34) of the 1894 Act. The Collector, with regard to the
              payment of compensation, can only act in the manner so
              provided. It is settled proposition of law (classic statement
              of Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad[1]) that where a power is
              given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must
              be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of
              performance are necessarily forbidden.
              19. Now, this is admitted position that award was made on
              31.01.2008. Notices were issued to the landowners to
              receive the compensation and since they did not receive the
              compensation, the amount (Rs.27 crores) was deposited in
              the government treasury. Can it be said that deposit of the
              amount of compensation in the government treasury is
              equivalent to the amount of compensation paid to the
              landowners/persons interested? We do not think so. In a
              comparatively recent decision, this Court in Agnelo
              Santimano Fernandes[2], relying upon the earlier decision in
              Prem Nath Kapur[3], has held that the deposit of the amount
              of the compensation in the state‟s revenue account is of no
              avail and the liability of the state to pay interest subsists till
              the amount has not been deposited in court.
              20. From the above, it is clear that the award pertaining to
              the subject land has been made by the Special Land
              Acquisition Officer more than five years prior to the
              commencement of the 2013 Act. It is also admitted position
              that compensation so awarded has neither been paid to the
              landowners/persons interested nor deposited in the court.
              The deposit of compensation amount in the government
              treasury is of no avail and cannot be held to be equivalent to
              compensation paid to the landowners/persons interested. We
              have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the subject land
              acquisition proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed
              under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.”
W.P. (C) No.11/2015
                                                                           Page 5 of 7

7.       Mr.Jain has also raised objection with regard to maintainability of the
         present writ petition on the ground that the petitioner is a subsequent
         purchaser. We find the objection to be misplaced on account of
         decision rendered in the case of Govt. of NCT of Delhi Vs. Manav
         Dharma Trust and another, reported in 2017 (6) SCC 751, para 28 of
         which, reads as under:-
                  “28. Thus, the subsequent purchaser, the assignee, the
                  successor in interest, the power-of-attorney holder, etc.,
                  are     all    persons     who      are     interested     in
                  compensation/landowners/ affected persons in terms of
                  the 2013 Act and such persons are entitled to file a case
                  for a declaration that the land acquisition proceedings
                  have lapsed by virtue of operation of Section 24(2) of the
                  2013 Act. It is a declaration qua the land wherein
                  indisputably they have an interest and they are affected
                  by such acquisition. For such a declaration, it cannot be
                  said that the respondent-writ petitioners do not have any
                  locus standi.”
8.       Taking into consideration the submissions made and the stand taken
         by the LAC in the counter affidavit, we are of the considered view that
         the necessary ingredients for the application of Section 24(2) of the
         2013 Act, as has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of India, stand
         satisfied.
9.       Since the award having been announced more than five years prior to
         the commencement of the 2013 Act and, having regard to the stand
         taken by the LAC that the compensation has not been tendered to the
         petitioner, the petitioner is entitled to a declaration that the acquisition
         proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 with
         regard to the subject land are deemed to have lapsed. It is ordered
         accordingly.

10.      The writ petition is disposed of.

writ petition.
