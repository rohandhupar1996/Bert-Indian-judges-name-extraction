                  IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
     (THE HIGH COURT OF ASSAM: NAGALAND: MIZORAM AND
                         ARUNACHAL PRADESH)
                          WP(C)No.3379/2014
        Smti. Paree Mahanta Hazarika
                                                                   …Petitioner
                                   -Versus-
        The Managing Director,
        Assam Govt. Marketing Corporation
        Limited and Another
                                                               … Respondents
                                 BEFORE
     HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ACHINTYA MALLA BUJOR BARUA
        Advocates for the Petitioner        :     None appeared
        Advocate for the Respondents        :     None appeared
        Date of hearing & Judgment           :    10.07.2017
                   JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
      None appears for the petitioner, when the matter is called upon.
2.    The orders dated 08.02.2017, 27.03.2017 and 31.03.2017 also shows
that none had appeared on behalf of the petitioner, when the matter was
called upon.

                                          2
3.     As per the Office Note dated 05.08.2014, Mr. BK Bhagawati, Mr. A
Chakraborty and Mr. N Mondal, learned counsel had entered appearance on
behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2. Neither the affidavit-in-opposition has been
filed by the aforesaid learned counsel on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2,
nor anyone has appeared for them.
4.     Under the aforesaid circumstances and in the absence of the required
cooperation from the learned counsel, this Court has no other option but to
take up the matter on its own.
5.     In paragraph 2 of the writ petition, it is stated that upon coming to
know that there exist certain vacancies in Pragjyotika, Assam Emporium under
the Assam Government Marketing Corporation Ltd., (for short, AGMC) the
petitioner had submitted an application dated 13.09.2013 for the post of Sales
Assistant.
6.     Accordingly by the order dated 13.09.2013 of the Managing Director,
the petitioner was appointed as Sales Assistant and subsequently, by another
order dated 20.12.2013 of the Managing Director of the AGMC, her services
was extended for a period of 90 days. Subsequently, on 28.04.2014, the
services of the petitioner was again extended for 90 days.
7.     It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner having rendered her
services to the full satisfaction of the respondent authorities, she has the right
to continue in service.
8.     In this writ petition, the petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated
20.06.2014 of the Managing Director of the AGMC, which indicates that in the
231st Meeting of the Board of Directors of AGMC held on 20.06.2014, a
decision was taken that the services of the petitioner, who was appointed as a
casual worker, shall not be continued after the expiry of the term of
engagement.

                                         3
9.     The only stand taken in the writ petition in paragraph 7 is that the
respondent authorities instead of appointing the petitioner had chosen to
remove the petitioner from service without any cogent reason.
10.    Accordingly, it is the case of the petitioner that the entire action of the
respondent authorities is arbitrary, illegal and also in violation of Article 14 of
the Constitution of India.
11.    A mere perusal of the statement made in paragraph 2 of the writ
petition shows that the petitioner was given appointed for a fixed period on
application made by her and the same was not made pursuant to any
selection procedure or by following the constitutional scheme.
12.    In such view of the matter, this Court is of the view that there does not
exist any subsisting right of the petitioner to remain in service and, as such,
no infirmity is found in the order dated 20.06.2014 of the Managing Director
of the AGMC by which it was decided that the services of the petitioner shall
not be continued any further.
13.    Accordingly, in that view of the matter, this writ petition is found to be
devoid of any merit and the same is dismissed.
                                                                           JUDGE
Shivani
