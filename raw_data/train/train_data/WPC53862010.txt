                                 JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
             Heard Mr. B. Chakraborty, the learned counsel for the petitioner. The
respondent Nos.1 & 2 are represented by Mr. B. Kaushik, the learned standing counsel
for the Department of Higher Education. The Nirmal Haloi College, Barpeta
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the College’) and their Governing Body (respondent Nos.3
& 4), are represented by the learned counsel Mr. S.K. Das. The learned lawyer Mr.
D.K. Sarma appears for the respondent No.5, who is the contesting litigant in the
case.
2.           This is an inter se seniority dispute between the petitioner and Nirmal Ch.
Saikia (respondent No.5), in respect of their service in the Nirmal Haloi College,
Barpeta. Earlier the Director of Higher Education (DHE), Assam issued the order of
1.1.2003, whereby, Nirmal Ch. Saikia (respondent No.5) was declared to be the senior
most Lecturer of the college and accordingly, his functioning as the Vice Principal, was
approved by the DHE. Under the impugned speaking order dated 27.8.2010
(Annexure-13), the DHE rejected the petitioner’s claim for seniority and upheld the
earlier order of 1.1.2003.
3.           The two contenders joined as Lecturer at the venture stage and the college
was brought under the deficit system of grants in aid, w.e.f. 11.1.1996, under the
DHE’s order of 2.5.1996. The following chart will indicate few relevant dates, for
determining the seniority question:-

4.           The petitioner secured first division marks in MA and satisfied the prevalent
UGC norms of 52.5%, when he entered service on 8.3.1998. However, the respondent
No.5 joined service on 12.9.1987 with only 52% marks in his MA examination and
thus, he was an under-qualified teacher. To improve his prospects, the respondent re-
appeared in his MA examination and could marginally better his marks from 52% to
Writ Petition (C) No.5386/2010                                                                                         2 of 7

53.8%. But by then, the appointment norms were raised to 55% under the UGC’s
letter dated 28th October, 1991 and the revised norms were intimated on 15.2.1994,
by the UGC to the Assam authorities.
5.         At that stage, the Assam Government took note that many under-qualified
teachers without UGC norms, are serving in the venture colleges, where affiliation for
degree classes was being issued. Considering the undesirability of continuance of
under-qualified teachers in colleges being brought under the Government’s the Deficit
System of Grant-in-Aid, hereinafter referred to as “the Deficit System”, the Education
Department issued direction on 17.8.1993, to replace the under-qualified with those,
who satisfy the UGC criterion. A specific direction was issued to the petitioner’s college
on 7.4.1994 by the DHE, to urgently replace the under-qualified lecturers.
6.         Following the above direction, the College Executive Committee met on
2.7.1994 and resolved to discharge the lecturers, who do not possess the requisite
UGC norms (55%). A second resolution was taken on the same day, to however
continue the under-qualified teachers as part-time lecturers. Thus the service status of
the respondent No.5, was altered from lecturer to that of part-time lecturer, under the
College Management’s resolution dated 2.7.1994.
7.         The college was taken over by the Government under the Deficit System and
all the serving lecturers with UGC norms, were approved under the DHE’s letter dated
2.5.1996. In the appended list of posts in different subjects, some were shown to be
vacant and it was clarified that vacancy is shown either because of actual vacancy or
because, the incumbents holding the posts, do not possess the UGC norms. Most
significantly, although the private respondent had joined service on 12.9.1987 and was
the senior most in the political science department, his post was shown to be vacant,
in the DHE’s notification of 2.5.1996 whereas, two junior appointees in the same
department, were included in the list of teachers, approved by the Government.
8.         The Executive Committee of the College next met on 5.9.1994 where around
13 resolutions were adopted. The minutes of the Managing Committee’s meeting was
recorded in Assamese and in the cramped space, just above the President’s signature,
a 14th resolution is inserted in an unnatural fashion, whereby, the first two resolution
of the previous meeting, was purportedly cancelled. But the handwriting of the 14th
resolution was in a different hand and it appears that this resolution to benefit the
under-qualified incumbents, was inserted, at a later stage in a clandestine fashion.
Writ Petition (C) No.5386/2010                                                      3 of 7

Commenting skeptically on the resolution No.14, the College Ex-President, in his letter
dated 15.3.2003 opined that this was surreptitiously inserted with sinister design by
some vested group. Thus genuineness of the resolution No.14, which directly
benefited the under-qualified incumbents, was questioned by the concerned President.
9.         Be that as it may, the private respondent continued as under-qualified lecturer
but unlike the petitioner who was treated to be an approved lecturer w.e.f. 11.1.1996
with UGC scale of pay, the respondent Nirmal Saikia didn’t enjoy the regular status.
But in relaxation of the norms, Govt. gave conditional approval for the under-qualified
teachers to allow them fixed pay of Rs.2,000/- p.m. However it was stipulated in the
DHE’s order of 13.2.1997 that, the fixed pay lecturers, must obtain Ph.D. or M.Phil
degree, within 8 years or else, their service will not be retained. The drawal of
senior/selection grade pay was however stopped until, the fixed pay incumbents,
obtains the prescribed UGC qualification.
10.        The private respondent secured the M.Phil degree on 24.11.1997 and w.e.f.
that date (24.11.1997), the fixed pay incumbent, was allowed to draw the UGC scale
of pay (Rs.2200-4000/-), under the DHE’s order dated 8.1.1999. The regularization of
service of the private respondent with 10 others, was approved by the Government on
27.9.1999 on the presumption that the respondent No.5 purportedly satisfied the UGC
norms, when he entered service on 12.9.1987. But the improved marks i.e. 53.8%
was erroneously noted in the regularization order and the respondent’s original marks
of 52%, relevant for service entry on 12.9.1987, was totally overlooked.
11.        However, the implication of the college management’s resolution of 2.7.1994,
for termination of the under-qualified lecturer and his re-appointment as a part-time
lecturer, did not receive attention of the DHE and consequently, respondent No.5 is
treated to be in uninterrupted service since 12.9.1987. When the college was
provincialised on 2.5.1996, originally, the respondent No.5 was not brought under the
deficit grants in aid scheme. In relaxation of norms, his retention on fixed pay was
however approved w.e.f. 11.1.1996, under the DHE’s order dated 13.2.1997. The
respondent No.5 obtained his M. Phil degree on 24.11.1997 and only thereafter, he
satisfied the requirement stipulated for the retention of the fixed pay lecturer.
Eventually, the respondent No.5 was placed at par with the petitioner, in so far as
their respective service being taken over, under the grants in aid scheme. But the
record shows that the petitioner was allowed to draw the regular UGC scale of pay
Writ Petition (C) No.5386/2010                                                      4 of 7

w.e.f. 11.1.1996 but the respondent No.5 was allowed to draw the UGC scale of pay
only from the date, when he acquired the M. Phil qualification i.e. on 24.11.1997.
12.        It is significant that the service of the petitioner was confirmed w.e.f. 6.9.1999,
whereas the confirmation of the service of the respondent No.5 was done only on
14.1.2000. Both at the stage of senior scale and selection grade scale of pay, the
petitioner was ahead of the respondent No.5 and this priority position is also
maintained in the Associate Professor grade, since the respondent No.5 secured the
benefit on 24.11.2010, whereas, the petitioner got the Associate Professor Grade
w.e.f. 13.1.2008.
13.        Under the judgment rendered on 31.5.2010 (Annexure-12), in the WP(C)
No.6742/2004, the Writ Court while remitting the inter se seniority dispute for
consideration by the DHE, observed that the authority must consider the implications
of the fact that the respondent No.5 received the regular scale, the confirmation and
also the senior scale, at a later point of time, than the petitioner. The impact of DHE’s
earlier communication of 2.5.1996 (Annexure-1), whereby, the college was brought
under the deficit scheme, to the exclusion of the respondent No.5, whose post was
shown to be vacant in the Department of Political Science, was also required to be
considered by the DHE. But it is apparent from the impugned speaking order of
27.8.2010 (Annexure-13), that those significant factors, specified in the High Court’s
judgment in the WP(C) No.6742/2004, were ignored by the DHE. Instead, only on the
basis that the respondent No.5 was appointed on 12.9.1987, prior to the petitioner’s
joining on 18.9.1987, the inter se seniority was declared in favour of the respondent
No.5, by the Director.
14.        According to Mr. B. Chakraborty, the learned counsel for the petitioner, the
private respondent cannot claim seniority w.e.f. 12.9.1987 when he joined service in
the college since the appointed lecturer was terminated by the college management
on 2.7.1994 but was engaged thereafter as a Part-Time Lecturer. On the other hand,
Mr. D.K. Sarmah, the learned counsel for the private respondent submits that right
since 12.9.1987 the respondent No.5 has continued his service in the college without
any break and therefore such uninterrupted service should account for inter se
seniority determination, of the two rival litigants.
15.        When the service is in the same status and without break, the declaration of
seniority in favour of the longer serving lecturer, will perhaps be alright. But the
Writ Petition (C) No.5386/2010                                                           5 of 7

question is whether the service of respondent No.5 suffered a break, on account of
the college management’s discharge resolution of 2.7.1994 and the re-appointment of
the under-qualified teacher as a part time lecturer, by the 2nd resolution adopted on
2.7.1994. In so far as the Managing Committee’s resolution of 5.9.1994, which
purportedly cancels the termination resolution of 2.7.1994, the former GB President
Mr. G.C. Sharma, under his letter dated 15.3.2003, expressed the view that the
cancellation resolution was surreptitiously inserted in the minutes by some vested
interest, with sinister design in the cramped space, just above the signature of the
President. The likelihood of inter-polation in the College Executive Committee’s
resolution of 5.9.1994, can also be seen from the College Principal’s communication
dated 19.11.2003, in the context of the Appeal filed before the DHE, Assam. If the
under-qualified lecturer was actually discharged by the College on 2.7.1994 and was
reappointed again as a part-time lecturer, such continuation in a lesser post may not
account for determination of seniority, on the basis of length of service. But this
aspect was wholly ignored by the DHE, in the impugned speaking order dated
27.8.2010 (Annexure-13). Thus manifestation of an incorrect determination of
seniority, is noticed in the case.
16.        The above circumstances suggest that the determination of inter se seniority
under the impugned order dated 27.8.2010 (Annexure-13) by the DHE was based
entirely upon the continuation of service of the two incumbents, without examination
of whether the status of the private respondent was changed from that of lecturer to
part-time lecturer, under the College Management’s resolution of 2.7.1994. The fact
that the under-qualified lecturer was discharged on 2.7.1994, is also overlooked by the
authority. In fact, a perfunctory exercise is perceived since the Director failed to bear
in mind the factors mentioned in paragraph 14 of the judgment dated 31.5.2010
(Annexure-12) in the WP(C) No.6742/2004, whereby the DHE was asked to decide the
inter se seniority, of the two litigants.
16.        Having noticed the errors in the impugned order dated 27.8.2010 (Annexure-
13), this court is of the considered opinion that the inter se seniority of the petitioner
and the respondent No.5 must be re-determined. All the relevant factors as noted
above must be considered and decision be given after affording hearing to all the
parties, including the College Management. To facilitate the ordered exercise, the
petitioner will furnish a copy of this order to the DHE. The College Authorities must
Writ Petition (C) No.5386/2010                                                      6 of 7

produce in original, the College Executive Committee’s resolutions of 2.7.1994 and
5.9.1994, so that the DHE can consider the implication of those resolutions. As this
case is pending since long, the ordered exercise be completed expeditiously and
preferably within 3(three) months from today. The impugned speaking order dated
27.8.2010 (Annexure-13) will abide by the final decision of the DHE, in the ordered
exercise. It is ordered accordingly.
17.        A copy of this order be furnished to the departmental lawyer Mr. B. Kaushik,
for onward communication.
