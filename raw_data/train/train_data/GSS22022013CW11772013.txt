                         Through : Mr.Sandeep Sethi, Sr. Adv. with

                         versus
      UNION OF INDIA AND ORS                              ..... Respondents
                         Through : Mr.Amitesh Kumar, Adv.
      CORAM:
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.S.SISTANI
G.S.SISTANI, J (ORAL)
  1. Present writ petition has been filed by petitioners under Article 226 of the
      Constitution of India seeking a writ of certiorari for setting aside the
      communication dated 6.2.2013 issued by respondent no.2 to the
      petitioner. The petitioners also seek a writ of mandamus directing
      respondent no.2 to inspect petitioner no.1 institute to verify the
      compliance.
  2. With the consent of learned senior counsel for the petitioners and counsel
      for respondent no.2 the writ petition is being disposed of at the stage of
      notice itself in view of the fact that respondent no.2 has entered
      appearance on an advance copy.
  3. The necessary facts, to be noticed for disposal of the present writ petition,
      are that in the year 2009 the petitioner no.1 institute was established.
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                  Page 1 of 11

      Balika Vidyapith, Lakhisarai, is a registered charitable trust under the
      Societies Act, 1860. In the year 2009, Balika Vidyapith, Lakhisarai, had
      applied to respondent no.2, AICTE, for establishment of petitioner no.1
      engineer institute. Respondent no.2 vide its letter dated 30.6.2009
      accorded its approval to establish petitioner no.1 institute initially for a
      period of two years subject to fulfillment of terms and conditions as stated
      in the said letter. The initial approval was accorded for intake of 240 seats
      in four different streams. It is stated that for the year 2010-2011 a general
      approval was granted to all the institutions. The approval extended to the
      petitioner for the session 2011-2012 and 2010-2011 are disputed by
      respondent no.2. Meanwhile inspections were carried out at the petitioner
      institute. On 25.12.2011 petitioner no.1 submitted its application to
      respondent no.2 for extension of the approval granted to the petitioner.
      Pursuant to the request made by petitioner no.1, the expert committee
      appointed by respondent no.2 inspected petitioner no.1 institute and after
      satisfying itself of the pre-requisite conditions, respondent no.2 had
      accepted the fee for the same.
  4. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that despite the premises
      of the petitioner institute having been inspected for almost on eight
      occasions there was no communication to the petitioners from respondent
      no.2 as to whether the extension of approval had been granted or not.
      Senior counsel further submits that on 7.12.2012 petitioner no.2 received
      a show cause notice dated 29.11.2012 from respondent no.2, wherein
      certain deficiencies were pointed out by respondent no.2. Petitioner no.1
      vide letter dated 9.12.2012 submitted its reply to the said show cause
      notice to respondent no.2 on 10.12.2012. In the evening of 7.1.2013
      petitioner no.1 received a fax from respondent no.2 for appearing before
      the Standing Complaint Committee on the very next day i.e. 8.1.2013.
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                   Page 2 of 11

      Senior counsel further submits that sufficient time was not granted by the
      respondent no.2 to enable the petitioners to collect and produce the
      required information, however, petitioner no.2 made himself available but
      he could not produce all the relevant material/document due to paucity of
      time. On the same date i.e. 8.1.2013 petitioner no.1 received a
      communication from respondent no.2 by email by which petitioner no.1
      was informed that they are enabling „Add Program‟ button in the Program
      form for the Institute and advised petitioner no.1 to add only the existing
      programme that is for the academic year 2012-2013. Petitioner no.1 was
      also requested not to add any new programme in the application, any new
      programme not running in the institute and the corresponding courses in
      that programme would not be processed for the year 2013-14.
  5. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was
      shocked to receive the communication dated 6.2.2013 by which the
      approval granted to petitioner no.1 for the academic session 2009-2010
      was withdrawn and no extension of approval for the sessions 2010-2011,
      2011-2012 and 2012-2013 was granted to petitioner no.1. Senior counsel
      further submits that as far as the approval for the year 2010-2011 is
      concerned, the same was granted to all the institutions on 5.7.2012, which
      is disputed by counsel for respondent no.2. Senior counsel contends that a
      request has been made to the Director of Technical Education, Patna, for
      shifting of all the students of the college to other approved colleges,
      which will have far reaching consequences on the students who are
      studying in the petitioner institute as supplementary examinations are in
      progress and the final examinations are scheduled to be held from
      1.3.2013.
  6. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that respondent no.2 has
      failed to take into consideration the reply to the show cause notice and the
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                 Page 3 of 11

      impugned order is devoid of any reason. Senior counsel further submits
      that while passing the impugned order, the respondent no.2 has failed to
      deal with the clarifications rendered by the petitioners in reply to the show
      cause notice and, thus, on this ground alone the impugned order is liable
      to be set aside. In support of this submission, reliance is placed by learned
      senior counsel for the petitioner in the case of Mekaster Trading
      Corporation v. Union of India and Others, reported at 106 (2003) DLT
      573. Relevant portion reads as under:
             “20. ……. After making recital of the aforesaid events in the order,
             thereafter order proceeds to record as under:-
                     "I have examined the case and heard the presentation made
                     by the DGS&D representatives and submissions made by
                     M/S Mekaster Trading Corporation, New Delhi in their
                     letters dated 18.8.2001 and 6.2.2002 and oral presentations
                     on 4.3.2002. The sum and substance of the allegations
                     against the firm is that M/s Mekaster Trading Corporation,
                     New Delhi could not fulfill their contractual obligations as an
                     Indian agent of foreign supplier M/s Barin SPA, Italy. The
                     reply submitted by them vide their letter dated 18.8.2001 and
                     6.2.2002 and oral presentations made by them during hearing
                     of the case on 4.3.2002 have not been found convincing. The
                     available evidence does not reveal that the firm has fulfilled
                     its contractual obligations.
             28. …… However, the replies of the petitioner are equally
             elaborate and petitioner sought to explain its version in an attempt
             to meet each others allegation contained in the show cause notice
             and thereby contending that petitioner was not at fault and proposed
             action was not warranted. Whether the contention raised by the
             petitioners in their replies are considered and addressed, is the main
             question? Perusal of the impugned order shows that after making
             recital of the events which transpired after the show cause notice,
             i.e. filing of replies by the petitioner, giving of hearings to both
             parties who explained their respective cases, the penultimate para
             records that case has been examined and heard and the sum and
             substance of the allegation made against the petitioner was that
             petitioner could not fulfill its contractual obligation as Indian agent
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                    Page 4 of 11

             and replies submitted by the petitioner as well as oral representation
             made by them during hearing of the case have not been found
             convincing. All the arguments of the petitioners are brushed aside
             by the following utterances "the reply submitted by them vide their
             letters dated 18.8.2001 and 6.2.2002 and oral representation by
             them during hearing of the case on 4.3.2002 have not been found
             convincing. The available evidence does not reveal that the firm has
             fulfillled its contractual obligations."
             29. Passing the order in such a slip shod manner which has the
             serious effect of blacklisting the petitioner for a long period of 5
             years is certainly not act of good administration.
   7. Senior counsel has further relied upon Prakash Atlanta JV & ORS. V.
      National Highways Authority of India & Ors., reported at 169 (2010)
      DLT 664, more particularly para 33, which reads as under:
             33. At best the above statements can be termed as conclusions and
             not reasons. As pointed out by this Court in Mekaster Trading
             Corp., the above order does not indicate that "the decision maker
             successfully came to grips with the main contention advanced by
             the parties". It also fails to disclose "how the mind is applied to the
             subject matter; whether done relevantly or rationally". There are no
             reasons to indicate the application of mind and the mental process
             leading to the conclusion. Further as pointed out by the Division
             Bench of this Court in Indian Oil Corporation v. SPS Engineering
             Ltd. (supra) (DLT, p.425), "reasons must be contained in the order
             under challenge, and mere existence of reasons in the show cause
             notice, or any material referred to in the show cause notice, is not
             sufficient....the authority concerned must, at least in brief, deal in
             the impugned order with the explanation given in the reply, and
             give its reasons for holding that the explanation is not satisfactory."
 8.   Present petition has been opposed by Mr.Amitesh Kumar, learned counsel
      for respondent no.2. Mr.Kumar while drawing the attention of the Court
      to the show cause notice issued to petitioner no.1 on 29.11.2012 submits
      that various deficiencies were pointed out to petitioner no.1 including that
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                   Page 5 of 11

      as against the requirement of 16 classrooms only 07 class rooms were
      available and as a against the requirement of 64 faculty members only 31
      faculty members were available at petitioner no.1 at the time of
      inspection. Counsel contends that in the absence of classroom and faculty
      members the petitioner no.1 institute cannot be allowed to admit students.
 9.   Reliance is placed by learned senior counsel for respondent no.2 in the
      case of Shri Morvi Sarvajanik Kelavni Mandal Sanchalit MSKM BE.D
      College v. National Council for Teachers’ Education and Others,
      reported at (2012) 2 SCC 16, and in the case of Adarsh Shiksha
      Mahavidyalaya and Others v. Subhash Rahangdale and Others,
      reported at (2012) 2 SCC 425, in support of his submission that the
      students should not be allowed to continue in an unrecognized institute.
      Paras 16 and 17 of Shri Morvi Sarvajanik Kelavni Mandal Sanchalit
      MSKM BE.D College (supra) read as under:
             16. We do not think so, firstly, because the recognition of the
             institution stood withdrawn on 20-7-2011 which meant that while it
             had no effect qua admissions for the academic session 2010-2011 it
             was certainly operative qua admissions made for the academic
             session 2011-12 which commenced from 1-8-2011 onwards. The
             fact that there was a modification of the said order of withdrawal on
             24-8-2011 did not obliterate the earlier order dated 20-7-2011. The
             modifying order would in our opinion relate back and be effective
             from 20-7-2011 when the recognition was first withdrawn. Such
             being the position admissions made for the academic session 2011-
             2012 were not protected under the statute.
             13. Secondly, because this Court has in a long line of decisions
             rendered from time to time disapproved of students being allowed
             to continue in unrecognised institutions only on sympathetic
             considerations. In N.M. Nageshwaramma (supra) this Court while
             dealing with the prayer for grant of permission to the students
             admitted to unrecognised institution observed:
                    “3. … We are unable to accede to these requests. These
                    institutions were established and the students were admitted
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                  Page 6 of 11

                   into these institutes despite a series of press notes issued by
                   the Government. If by a fiat of the court we direct the
                   Government to permit them to appear at the examination we
                   will practically be encouraging and condoning the
                   establishment of unauthorised institutions. It is not
                   appropriate that the jurisdiction of the court either under
                   Article 32 of the Constitution or Article 226 should be
                   frittered away for such a purpose. The Teachers Training
                   Institutes are meant to teach children of impressionable age
                   and we cannot let loose on the innocent and unwary children,
                   teachers who have not 13 received proper and adequate
                   training. True they will be required to pass the examination
                   but that may not be enough. Training for a certain minimum
                   period in a properly organised and equipped Training
                   Institute is probably essential before a teacher may be duly
                   launched. We have no hesitation in dismissing the writ
                   petitions with costs.
                                                             (emphasis supplied)”
 10. Mr.Kumar contends that in the reply to the show cause notice petitioner
      no.1 has not disputed that there is any shortfall in the number of
      classrooms and the faculty members, and in view thereof no further
      reasons were required to be furnished to the petitioner in the impugned
      order and, thus, the judgments, sought to be relied upon by learned senior
      counsel for the petitioner, are not applicable to the facts of the present
      case.
 11. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the number of
      classes and faculty members are sufficient to teach the number of
      students, which have been admitted in the petitioner institute and, thus, it
      cannot be said that the college lacks the number of classrooms or faculty
      members.
 12. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, considered their rival
      contentions, perused the documents placed on record including the
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                  Page 7 of 11

      annexures, show cause notice, reply thereof, and the impugned order. The
      show cause notice, which was issued to the petitioner had pointed out
      eight deficiencies. The most important amongst those deficiencies were
      the non-availability of classrooms and the faculty members. As per the
      show cause notice, as against the requirement of 16 classrooms only 07
      classrooms were available and as per the requirement of 64 faculty
      members only 31 members were available. The following reply to the
      show cause notice was issued by the respondent on 9.12.2012:
             “With reference to the letter of AICTE Vide F.No.NRO/1-
             625637921-EOA/2011, November 29, 2012, that the following
             statement is being made.
             1. As per Sl.No.1 for class room not ready under chapter IV read
                 with Appendix 4.
                 Total number of class room (16) as per – AICTE norms shall be
                 ready within 6 months after getting the approval for the
                 academic session-2012-13. Presently having total number of
                 students in AIR (260 students) as year wise detail-73 students in
                 2009 batch, 125 students in 2010 batch & 62 students in 2011
                 batch -at present we are having 12 numbers of class room in
                 AIT, Lakhisarai.
             2. As per Sl.No.2 for faculty related issues under –5.1 Chapter IV:
                 Presently AIT Lakhisarai is having now 47 number of faculty in
                 place of 64 faculty, the shortfall number of faculty shall be
                 appointed within one month.
             3. As per the Sl.No.4 for other facilities under Chapter IV read
                 with Appendix 6.
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                 Page 8 of 11

                 Whatever the deficiencies, shall fulfill within 90 days after
                 getting the approval for the academic session 2012-13 &
                 whatever existing facilities available, have been provided before
                 the AICTE, New Delhi.
             4. As per the S.No.8 for Funds related issue under appendix 17
                 clause 2.5 Chapter I.
                 Presently, AIT-Lakhisarai is having 2.35 Crores (Two crores
                 thrity five lacs) Rupees as fixed deposit. Apart from this, an
                 account     in    local    S.B.I.     Lakhisarai    Branch     for
                 recurring/emergency vide A/c No.30845518676.”
 13. A reading of the reply to the show cause notice would show that petitioner
      no.1 has not disputed the deficiencies with respect to the classrooms and
      the faculty members and in fact time was sought by petitioner no.1 to
      make up the deficiencies. In view of this, it cannot be said that the order is
      devoid of any reasons as petitioners have admitted the deficiencies, which
      were pointed out to them in the show cause notice. Further as far as the
      submission made by learned senior counsel for petitioner that the
      classrooms and the faculty members are sufficient having regard to the
      number of students, which have been admitted, is concerned, this ground
      was not raised by petitioners in the reply to the show cause notice and,
      thus, the same could not have been dealt with by respondent no.2 in the
      impugned notice. Should there be any force in this submission then it is
      really for the respondents to consider the case of the petitioner afresh.
 14. I find force in the submission made by learned counsel for respondent
      no.2 that the judgments, sought to be relied upon by senior counsel for the
      petitioners, are not applicable to the facts of this case on account of the
      admissions of the petitioners that they do not have adequate classrooms
      and faculty members.
W.P.(C)1177/2013                                                   Page 9 of 11

 15. I find no infirmity in the order passed by respondent no.2 on 6.2.2013,
      however, the matter is remanded back to the Standing Complaint
      Committee to enable the petitioners to raise the ground that having regard
      to the number of students admitted there are sufficient classrooms and
      teachers. The respondent no.2 will issue a notice to the petitioner to
      appear along with all the relevant documents before the Standing
      Complaint Committee within fifteen days from today. The Standing
      Complaint Committee after granting a hearing to petitioner no.2 and or his
      representative, take all other steps, which will be required to satisfy
      themselves.
 16. There is also force in the submission made by counsel for respondent no.2
      that the petitioners cannot be allowed to continue in an unrecognized
      institute, however, keeping in view the peculiar facts of this case, that the
      supplementary examinations are in progress, the students will be
      permitted to appear only in the supplementary examination, and the final
      examinations, which are scheduled to be held from 1.3.2013 onwards in
      case the students have not already been transferred pursuant to the order
      dated 6.2.2013. This direction has been issued keeping in view the
      peculiar facts of this case so that the studies of the students are not
      disrupted and it may not be possible to transfer the student to any other
      approved college in such a short span of time. The students shall however
      be transferred after the examinations are concluded to any other approved
      college. It is made clear that the students will be informed by the
      petitioners about the orders passed by this Court today and the students
      should also be informed that in case the petitioners do not succeed what
      would be their fate, so that there is no false hope to the students. Let a
      copy of this order be sent to all the respondents herein.
 17. Writ petition and application stand disposed of.
