                                                   PIL NO.51 of 2016
                                BEFORE
          HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
             HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
22.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr. IA Talukdar, learned counsel for the petitioners.
        Mr. RKD Choudhdury, learned Additional Senior Government
        Advocate, Assam for the respondents.
        In the present Public Interest Litigation, the grievance of the
petitioners is that the drain cum footpath in a stretch of 1.5 kms from
Sadarghat Bridge, Cachar, Silchar is not being constructed properly.
        In response to the notice, Additional Deputy Commissioner,
Cachar, Silchar has stated on affidavit that the drain cum footpath in
question is being constructed under the supervision of Executive
Engineer, PWD (Rural Roads), Silchar, but the construction work has
presently been stopped due to pendency of the present petition.
        After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and with their
consent, we finally dispose of the writ petition with a direction to the
Deputy Commissioner, Silchar to ensure that drain cum footpath is
constructed strictly in accordance with the plan, estimate and
specifications prepared by the Public Works Department. We also
direct that construction work must be completed positively by
31.3.2018. And if during the period of construction, the local residents
complain of water logging and other inconvenience, the Deputy
Commissioner shall endeavour to redress them.
            JUDGE                                   CHIEF JUSTICE
