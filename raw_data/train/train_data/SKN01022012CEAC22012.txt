                          Through Mr. R. Krishnan, Advocate.
                    versus
      COMMISSIONER OF CENTRAL EXCISE.. Respondent
                          Through Mr. Satish Kumar, Sr. Standing

       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.V.EASWAR
                  ORDER
%                 01.02.2012
      The present appeal under Section 35G of the Central
Excise Act, 1944 (Act, for short), is directed against the order
dated 29th July, 2011, passed by the Customs, Excise and
Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (tribunal, for short) dismissing
the rectification application filed by the appellant. The appellant
had earlier impugned order dated 1st July, 2010 dismissing their
appeal, before this Court in CEAC No. 4/2011. The said appeal
was dismissed by the High Court vide order dated 25th January,
2011, inter alia, recording as under:-
                “   In  this  appeal     preferred    by   the
CEAC No. 2/2012                                              Page 1 of 12

                appellants the only issue which is raised
                relates to penalty imposed upon the
                appellants which is equal to duty under
                Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act,
                1944. The order of the Tribunal, however,
                does not show that such a contention if
                made was dealt with.
                      Learned counsel for the appellant
                makes a statement at the Bar that the issue
                was specifically raised. If that is so, it would
                be appropriate for the Tribunal to deal with
                the same in the first instance.
                      In these circumstances, we permit the
                appellant to move an application under the
                appropriate provisions of law seeking review
                of the order on the aforesaid term.
                      While granting the aforesaid liberty,
                this appeal is dismissed.”
2.    Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention
to the order in original dated 5th March, 2004, the operative
portion of which reads as under:-
                “     In view of the above discussion and
                findings, I proceed to pass the following
                order:-
      (i)       I confirm duty of Rs.17,88,262/- involved on
                the goods cleared without payment of duty
                during the period 1999-2000 and 2000-01
                under proviso to Section 11A(1) of the
                Central Excise Act, 1944.
      (ii)      I appropriate an amount of Rs.2,50,000/-
                voluntarily paid by the party as duty which
                may be adjusted against the above
                confirmed demand.

      (iii)     I impose penalty of Rs.17,88,262/- upon the
                party under Rule 173Q of Central Excise
                Rules, 1944 and Section 11 AC read with
                Section 38A of the Central Excise Act, 1944.
      (iv)      I also demand interest at the appropriate
                rate under Section 11AB of the Central
                Excise Act, 1944.
      (v)        I also impose penalty of Rs.10,000/-
                (Rupees Ten thousand only) upon Shri Raj
                Kumar, Partner of the firm under Rule 209A
                of Central Excise Rules, 1944 read with
                Section 38A of the Central Excise Act, 1944
                for the reasons stated above.”
3.    It is submitted that the operative portion did not give
benefit of Section 11 AC of the Act and our attention is drawn to
a judgment of this Court in K.P. Pouches (P) Limited versus
Union of India, 2008 (228) ELT 31 (Del), judgment of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court in Commissioner of Central
Excise, Rohtak versus J.R. Fabrics (P) Limited, 2009 (238)

4.    Section 11AC of the Act, reads as under:-
                “11AC. Penalty for short-levy or non-levy
                of duty in certain cases.—Where any duty
                of excise has not been levied or paid or has
                been     short-levied     or   short-paid     or
                erroneously refunded by reasons of fraud,
                collusion or any wilful mis-statement or
                suppression of facts, or contravention of any
                of the provisions of this Act or of the rules
                made thereunder with intent to evade
                payment of duty, the person who is liable to
                pay duty as determined under sub-section
                (2) of section 11A, shall also be liable to pay
                a penalty equal to the duty so determined:
                [Provided that where such duty as
                determined under sub-section (2) of section
                11A, and the interest payable thereon under
                section 11AB, is paid within thirty days from
                the date of communication of the order of the
                Central Excise Officer determining such
                duty, the amount of penalty liable to be paid
                by such person under this section be twenty-
                five per cent of the duty so determined:
                Provided further that the benefit of reduced
                penalty under the first proviso shall be
                available if the amount of penalty so
                determined has also been paid within the
CEAC No. 2/2012                                              Page 4 of 12

                period of thirty days referred to in that
                proviso:
                Provided also that where the duty
                determined to be payable is reduced or
                increased by the Commissioner (Appeals),
                the Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may
                be, the Court, then, for the purposes of this
                section, the duty, as reduced or increased,
                as the case may be, shall be taken into
                account:
                Provided also that in case where the duty
                determined to be payable is increased by the
                Commissioner (Appeals), the Appellate
                Tribunal or, as the case may be, the Court,
                then, the benefit of reduced penalty under
                the first proviso shall be available, if the
                amount of duty so increased, the interest
                payable thereon and twenty-five per cent. of
                the consequential increase of penalty have
                also been paid within thirty days of the
                communication of the order by which such
                increase in the duty takes effect.
                 Explanation.—For the removal of doubts, it
                is hereby declared that—
                 (1) the provisions of this section shall also
                apply to cases in which the order
                determining the duty under sub-section (2) of
                section 11A relates to notices issued prior to
                the date on which the Finance Act, 2000
                receives the assent of the President;
                 (2) any amount paid to the credit of the
                Central Government prior to the date of
                communication of the order referred to in the
                first proviso or the fourth proviso shall be
                adjusted against the total amount due from
                such person.]”
5.    The contention of the appellant is that the Assessing
CEAC No. 2/2012                                             Page 5 of 12

Officer in terms of the first proviso to Section 11AC should have,
while passing ultimate directions and in the final portion of the
order, should have specifically stated that in case the appellant
assessee pays the disputed tax and interest along with 25%
penalty, they would not be liable to pay 100% penalty which had
been imposed under Rule 173Q of the Central Excise Rules,
1944 and Section 11AC read with Section 38A of the Act. This it
is submitted vitiates the order in original and the tribunal should
have interfered.
6.    In the present case, as notice above, the order in original
was passed on 5th March, 2004 and was duly communicated to
the appellant assessee.       The appellant did not approach the
Assessing Officer with a request that he wanted to pay the duty
amount and the interest and, therefore, only 25% penalty should
be imposed. The total duty demand as per order in original was
Rs.17,88,262/-.    In addition, the appellant was liable to pay
interest on the said amount.           The allegation against the
appellant was that he had suppressed production/clearance of
finished goods i.e. man-made fabric laminated with PU foam and
these were clandestinely removed during the period 1999-2001.
The    appellant   thereafter    filed   first appeal   before      the
CEAC No. 2/2012                                          Page 6 of 12

Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals). In the first appeal
also the appellant did not question or challenge the order in
original for failure to give the option or make the computation to
enable the appellant to make payment under Section 11AC of
the Act. The appellant challenged the order in original on merits,
questioning the duty liability, interest and penalty. The appeal
was dismissed vide order dated 20th December, 2004.
Thereafter, the appellant filed the second appeal before the
tribunal on or about 18th March, 2005. At that stage also the
appellant did not deposit the duty demand or the interest. An
application for waiver of pre-deposit was moved. The appellant
had paid Rs.2.5 lacs during investigation. The tribunal asked
the appellant to make pre-deposit of Rs.4 lacs.        At the first
appellate stage, the appellant had made payment of Rs.1.5 lacs.
Thus, in all the appellant had deposited Rs.8 lacs, out of the
total duty demand of Rs.17,88,262/-.        As noticed above, the
appeal of the appellant was dismissed on merits vide order
dated 1st July, 2010.
7.    We have noted the aforesaid facts in view of the legal
contention raised by the appellant that benefit of Section 11AC
of the Act has been denied to him, because of the fault of the
CEAC No. 2/2012                                         Page 7 of 12

respondent and he being compelled to pay 100% penalty equal
to Rs.17,88,262/-, whereas in case benefit of the first proviso is
given, the appellant would be liable to pay Rs.4.47 lacs, in
addition to duty demand of Rs.17,88,262/- plus interest.
8.    We may have issued notice on the present appeal and
examined the said contention, but in view of the facts stated
above, we are of the opinion that the conduct of the assessee
shows that he was not interested and did not want to take
advantage or benefit of the first proviso to Section 11AC. He
never intended and wanted to make payment of the duty amount
or the interest. As noticed above, the order in original was passed
on 5th March, 2004 and his conduct since then does not show that
he was inclined to pay Rs.17,88,262/- (less Rs.2.5 lacs already
paid) or the interest payable thereon along with 25% penalty.
Since March, 2004 till today the only amount paid by him is Rs.8
lacs (Rs.2.5 lacs, Rs.1.5 lacs and Rs.4 lacs).
9.    The decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of K.P.
Pouches (P) Limited (supra) is distinguishable. In the said case,
the assessee had paid the full duty even before issue of the show
cause notice.     In these circumstances, the High Court felt that
imposition of 100% penalty was contrary to the terms of Section
11AC. The       contention  that  the  duty must     be paid      after
CEAC No. 2/2012                                           Page 8 of 12

the order in original is passed, was rejected.           Obviously, an
assessee, who has paid the duty in advance, cannot be denied
the benefit of Section 11AC on the ground that duty was paid
earlier in point of time. The Court also noticed that the order in
original     did    not   refer to   Section    11AC   and in these
circumstances in paragraph 27 of the judgment it was observed
as under:-
                “27. To obviate and similar situation from
                arising in future, we are of the opinion that in
                its adjudication order the adjudicating
                authority under the Act should explicitly state
                the options available to the Assessee under
                Section 11AC of the Act. Once the choices
                are made known to the Assessee and it still
                does not take advantage of the first proviso
                to Section 11AC of the Act, it will be entirely
                at its own peril. Therefore, it would be
                beneficial, both from the point of view of the
                Revenue as well as the Assessee, if the
                options available to the Assessee are
                mentioned in the adjudication order itself.”
10.   Pursuant to the aforesaid observations, the respondent
had issued instructions vide file No. 208/07/2008-CX-6 dated
22nd May, 2008, which reads as under:-
                “It is seen that these provisos to Section
                11AC of the Act have been specifically
                inserted to ensure speedy recoveries of the
                disputed amount. It is an incentive given to
                the assessee that if he pays the duty amount
                along with interest, the penalty is reduced to
CEAC No. 2/2012                                              Page 9 of 12

                25% of the duty. This provision is beneficial
                to the Department as well as the assessee
                as rightly pointed out by Delhi High Court
                and therefore, the assessee should be made
                aware of the option available to him.”
11.   Subsequently, the tribunal issued circular No. 898/18/09-
CX dated 15th September, 2009. For the sake of convenience,
paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said circular are reproduced:-
                “2. The matter has been examined. The
                provisions relating to reduction of penalty to
                25% are contained in proviso (1) to (4) of
                Section 11AC. In terms of proviso (1) and
                (2), a penalty imposed under Section 11AC
                can be reduced to 25% on fulfillment of
                following conditions.
      i.        Duty determined under Section 11A(2) and
                interest payable thereon has been paid
                within 30 days.
      ii.       The said period of 30 days is calculated from
                the date of communication of the order
                passed by a Central Excise Officer
                determining the duty.
      iii.      The reduced 25% penalty is also paid within
                30 days of the date of communication of the
                order passed by the Central Excise Officer.
                3.    From the above it is clear that in order
                to avail the benefit of 25% penalty, the duty,
                interest and penalty are required to be paid
                within 30 days of communication of the order
                passed by the adjudicating authority.
                Further, the reading of proviso (4)would also
                support this interpretation because the said
                proviso stipulate that wherever duty amount
                is increased at any appellate stage, in that
                case in order to avail the benefit of 25%
                penalty, the assessee is required to pay
CEAC No. 2/2012                                             Page 10 of 12

                differential amount within 30 days of the
                passing of the order by the appellate
                authority. A combined reading of all the 4
                proviso would, therefore, make it clear that
                the benefit of 25% penalty is applicable only
                when the assessee has paid duty, interest
                and the reduced penalty within 30 days of
                communication of the order passed by the
                adjudicating authority.    However, if the
                penalty amount is increased at the appellate
                stage, in that case the 25% of differential
                amount of penalty can be paid within 30
                days of communication of said appellate
                order. Therefore, the view taken by the
                Commissioner (Appeal) is not as per the
                provision of law.”
12.   The decision of the Delhi High Court and the aforesaid
circulars do not support the case of the appellant in view of the
factual background noticed above. The decision of the Punjab
and Haryana High Court in J.R. Fabrics (P) Limited (supra) is
also distinguishable as the assessee in the said case had
conceded and accepted their defaults and deposited the entire
duty amount before issue of the show cause notice. Similarly,
the decisions of the Gujarat High Court can be distinguished on
the ground that they pertain to the factual matrix applicable to
the said cases. In the present case, as noticed above, it is clear
from the conduct of the assessee that he never wanted or
showed any inclination to pay the duty amount or the interest
CEAC No. 2/2012                                           Page 11 of 12

and was throughout contesting the order in original on merits. In
case the appellant assessee had any grievance with regard to
non-compliance of Section 11AC, the said grievance should
have been raised at the earliest opportunity.       The appellant
should have deposited the duty amount. In view of the above
factual matrix, we hold that no substantial question of law arises.
      The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
