HON’BLE MS JUSTICE INDIRA BANERJEE
HON’BLE MR JUSTICE V. KAMESWAR RAO
                                 JUDGMENT
V. KAMESWAR RAO, J. (ORAL)
W.P.(C) 7714/2016
1.       The challenge in the writ petition is to the order dated May 23,
2014 issued by the respondents whereby it was decided that under the
provisions of Rule 50 of the Indo Tibetan Border Police Force Rules,
1994, Sh. Rama Kant Sharma, Deputy Inspector General at Headquarters
(Northern) Frontier, Indo Tibetan Border Police Force was detailed to
prepare the records of evidence against the petitioner herein.
2.       Some of the relevant facts are that the petitioner who had joined the
W.P.(C) No. 7714/2016                                                 Page 1 of 6

Indo Tibetan Border Police Force as a Medical Officer on July 29, 1987,
was promoted as Senior Medical Officer on July 29, 1991. She was
further promoted as Chief Medical Officer on July 29, 1997 and
thereafter as Chief Medical Officer (Senior Grade) on April, 4, 2002. In
the month of September, 2012, respondent no.4 made a specific
complaint against the petitioner alleging therein that petitioner had
demanded Rs.10,000/- from him as illegal gratification and further
accepted Rs.5,000/- as part payment from him to declare him medically
fit. It is averred in the Writ petition that the respondents have conducted
two Court of Enquiries in 2013 and also a record of enquiry in the month
of June, 2014. It is also averred that a Writ Petition being W.P.(C)
4364/2016 was filed by the petitioner challenging the impugned charge
memo issued to the petitioner dated May 23, 2014. The said Writ Petition
was disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court vide order dated July
26, 2016 with the following observations:
       “2. There are averments concerning application of the rule of
       double jeopardy. There are averments suggestive of the fact
       that the complaint by Ct./S.K.(Recruit) Ajeet Singh had no
       concern with the earlier inquiry. There is copious reference to
       the philosophy of the law concerning Austin view on legal
       theories.
       3. Faced as aforesaid counsel seeks leave to withdraw the writ
       petition with right reserved to file a fresh petition on the same
       cause but projecting the cause clearly. The cause would relate
W.P.(C) No. 7714/2016                                                Page 2 of 6

       to the challenging to the chargesheet issued after a
       preliminary inquiry was held concerning complaint made by
       Ajeet Singh.”
3.       The only submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner
pointing out the order dated October, 30, 2014 is that out of the two
charges framed against the petitioner, the second charge has not been
proved and the first charge which is under Section 44 (e) of the Indo
Tibetan Border Police Force Act, 1992 being an offence under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 needs to be tried by the Special Judge
and not by the respondents. In this regard, he would draw our attention to
Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. He also relied upon
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Crl. A. 943/2008 titled as State
Through: CBI v. Jitender Kr. Singh decided on February 5, 2014 to
contend that the Supreme Court in the said case has upheld the view taken
by the Special Judge, CBI by holding that he had the jurisdiction under
Sub-Section 3 of Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
Since the only issue raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is with
regard to the charge, as noted above, we had put a specific query to the
learned counsel for the respondents, whether the petitioner is being
prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, to which the
answer was in the negative. If that be so, the issue raised by the counsel
for the petitioner needs to be decided keeping in view Section 44 (e) of
W.P.(C) No. 7714/2016                                             Page 3 of 6

the Indo Tibetan Border Police Force Act, 1992 (for short, Act of 1992).
The said Section 44 reads as under:
       “44. Miscellaneous offences.-Any person subject to this Act
       who commits any of the following offences, that is to say,---
         (a) being in command at any post or on the march, and
         receiving a complaint that any one under his command has
         beaten or otherwise maltreated or oppressed an person, or
         has disturbed any fair or market, or committed any riot or
         trespass, fails to have due reparation made to the injured
         person or to report the case to the proper authority; or
         (b) by defiling any place of worship, or otherwise,
         intentionally insults the religion, or wounds the religious
         feelings of any person; or
         (c) attempts to commit suicide, and in such attempt does any
         act towards the commission of such offence; or
         (d) being below the rank of subordinate officer, when off
         duty, appears without proper authority, in or about camp, or
         in or about, or when going to, or returning from any town or
         bazzar, carrying a rifle, sword or other offensive weapon; or
         (e) directly or indirectly accepts or obtains, or agrees to
         accept, or attempts to obtain, for himself or for any other
         person, any gratification as a motive or reward for procuring
         the enrolment of any person, or leave of absence, promotion
         or any other advantage or indulgence for any person in the
         service; or
         (f) commits any offence against the property or person of any
         inhabitant of, or resident in, the country in which he is
         serving,
         shall, on conviction by a Force Court, be liable to suffer
         imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years or
         such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.”
4.       On a perusal of Section 44 of the Act of 1992, it is clear that an
W.P.(C) No. 7714/2016                                               Page 4 of 6

Officer, who has committed an offence which is as depicted in first
charge, i.e., “Directly agreeing to accept for herself any gratification as
a motive or any other advantage” can be tried for such an offence under
the said provision. The said provision also stipulates, on conviction, the
Officer is liable for imprisonment. If that be so, from the intent of the
said Section under which the petitioner has been proceeded it is clear
that the authorities have the power and they are competent to proceed
against an Officer under such provision, the outcome of which would
necessarily depend upon, whether the offence is proved or not. We
restraint from saying anything on the merit of the charge / offence.
Hence, the plea of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that she should
be proceeded under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
and be tried by a Special Judge is rejected.
5.       We agree with the submissions made by the learned counsel for
the respondents that before initiating an action under the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988, certain procedures needs to be carried out and
such procedure has not been carried out in the case in hand. In any case,
the charge / offence against which the petitioner is being proceeded is
under the provisions of Section 44 (e) of Act of 1992 and it is the process
laid down under the said Act, which needs to be followed and not the
W.P.(C) No. 7714/2016                                             Page 5 of 6

provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998 as contended by the
learned counsel for the petitioner. The Judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of State Thr: CBI v. Jitender Kumar Singh has no
applicability in the facts of this case.
6.       Having held that the petitioner can be proceeded under the
provisions of Section 44 (e) of the Act, 1992, we do not see any merit in
the only submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
7.       The writ petition is dismissed.
CM No.31835/2016 (for stay)
         Dismissed as infructuous.
