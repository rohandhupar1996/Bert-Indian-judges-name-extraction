HON'BLE MS.JUSTICE HIMA KOHLI
HIMA KOHLI, J. (ORAL)
1.           The present petition is filed by the petitioner praying inter alia
for restoration of the allotment of stall/unit No.81 located at Chhoti Sabzi
Mandi, Tilak Marg, New Delhi, by setting aside the cancellation letter dated
10.10.2005.
2.           It is averred in the writ petition that the petitioner is a hawker,
who used to hawk in Nehru Place since the year 1980. On 07.04.1998, the
petitioner was given an alternative hawking site at Tilak Marg, in lieu of his
hawking site at Nehru Place on the basis of a draw of lots. On 30.11.1998,
the respondent/DDA demanded a sum of `1,71,405/- from the petitioner for
handing over possession of the aforesaid site. It is averred by the petitioner
that in June 2004, an initial amount of `43,000/- was deposited by him. On
W.P.(C) 7635/2010                                                     Page 1 of 4

06.05.2004, the respondent/DDA called upon the petitioner to pay an
additional sum of `7,754/- as the balance amount of 25% of the initial
amount paid by him. The petitioner paid the said amount in May 2004. On
16.06.2004, possession of the stall in question was handed over to the
petitioner. However, the petitioner admittedly failed to deposit the remaining
installments with the respondent/DDA in terms of the allotment.            As a
result, vide impugned letter dated 10.10.2005, his allotment was cancelled
and he was called upon to hand over vacant physical possession of the stall
(Annexure-K).     In the aforesaid letter, the respondent/DDA had also
informed the petitioner that two post dated cheques handed over by him,
which were due on 01.11.2004 and 01.05.2005 did not get encashed.
Counsel for the petitioner concedes that the aforesaid cheques were indeed
returned by his banker on account of insufficient funds maintained in the
account of the petitioner.
3.           Thereafter, for the next five years, the petitioner did not take
any steps to approach the respondent/DDA for restoration of the allotment
of the stall in question. The only correspondence placed on record is a
representation dated 03.05.2010 addressed by the petitioner to the Lt.
Governor, Delhi, praying inter alia for restoration of the allotment of the stall
in his favour. Counsel for the petitioner states that the said representation
was made by the petitioner by relying upon an order passed in a writ
W.P.(C) 7635/2010                                                  Page 2 of 4

petition filed by another vendor, who was relocated from Nehru Place to
Chhoti Sabzi Mandi, Tilak Marg, New Delhi, and had approached the Court
for condonation of delay beyond a period of 360 days in making the payment
in terms of the allotment, registered as W.P.(C) 7355/2007 entitled Nek
Ram Gupta vs. DDA. A copy of the order dated 01.12.2008 passed in the
aforesaid writ petition is placed on record as Annexure-M. In the aforesaid
order, the Court had noted that the prayer made by the petitioner therein
was for directions to the respondent to accept the balance amount of the
demand notice and further that the petitioner therein had already deposited
a sum of `50,000/- approximately towards part payment and had made a
representation to the Commissioner (Lands) for condonation of delay in
making the payment. Unlike the aforesaid case wherein no cancellation order
had been passed, in the present case, due to repeated defaults on the part
of the petitioner, a cancellation order came to be passed             by the
respondent/DDA on 10.10.2005.
4.           Be that as it may, having regard to the fact that counsel for the
petitioner states that the petitioner is ready and willing to pay the balance
outstanding amount payable by him in terms of the demand-cum-allotment
letter issued by the respondent/DDA and then complete all requisite
formalities, upon being so intimated by the respondent/DDA, the petitioner
is granted one      last opportunity to submit a representation to          the
W.P.(C) 7635/2010                                                 Page 3 of 4

Commissioner (Land) DDA for restoration of the allotment of the subject stall
in his favour.   In case the Commissioner (Lands), DDA is empowered to
restore the said allotment in terms of the prevalent policy of the DDA, the
said representation to be made by the petitioner shall be considered and
disposed of by passing a speaking order. However, in case the Commissioner
(Lands), DDA is not empowered to restore the said allotment, the said
representation to be    made by the petitioner shall be forwarded to the
Chairman/Vice Chairman, DDA for consideration and disposal in accordance
with the prevalent policy of the DDA. Thereafter, the decision taken shall be
communicated in writing to the petitioner by either of the authorities, within
a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of the said representation.
5.           The present petition is disposed of in terms of the aforesaid
order, alongwith the pending application, while leaving the parties to bear
their own costs.
