                                              JUDGMENT AND ORDER
                       Heard Mr. K.N. Choudhury, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
               petitioners. The respondents are represented by Mr. D. Saikia, the learned Addl.
               Advocate General, Assam.
               2.      The petitioners applied for admission for medical studies against the 85%
               State quota seats, but they are considered ineligible because of Rule 3(1)(c) of the
               Medical Colleges and Dental Colleges of Assam (Regulation of Admission into 1st
               year MBBS/BDS Course) Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the “Admission
               Rules, 2017”). The Rule stipulates that a student should have studied in a Assam
               School in all classes from Class VII – Class XII. The applicants have done their
               schooling outside the State and they seek prospective operation of the Rule 3(1)(c),
               from the next year’s admission.
               3.      In this case, the admission seekers are Bikram Roy (All India Rank-24571,
               State Rank-55), Shahrukh Khan (All India Rank-57800, State Rank-274), Chinmoy
               Saikia (All India Rank-72606, State Rank-407), Kunal Dey (All India Rank-82004,
               State Rank-514) and Uday Buragohain (All India Rank-90857, State Rank-609).
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                         Page 2 of 14

               4.      Some candidates who have pursued their school education in outside Assam
               schools for which, they are considered ineligible for the 85% State quota seats in
               the Government Medical Colleges of Assam, by application of Rule 3(1)(c) of the
               Admission Rules, 2017 challenged the validity of Rule 3(1)(c) but the Division Bench
               on 2.8.2017, had declared the Rule 3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017, to be
               valid. However, the matters were remanded to the Single Judge to determine
               whether, the new Rule gazetted on 11.7.2017, will govern this year’s admission, for
               which the admission process started with the Notice issued on 30.1.2017 by the
               CBSE, for conducting the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) (UG) for
               2017-2018, for admission to MBBS/BDS Courses.
               5.      The admission for medical seats was regulated earlier by the Medical
               Colleges of Assam, Regional Dental College, Guwahati and the Government
               Ayurvedic College, Guwahati (Regulation of Admission of Under-Graduate Students)
               Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2007 Regulation”). This was repealed by
               the Assam (Regulation of Admission into 1st Year MBBS/BDS Courses) Rules, 2015
               (hereinafter referred to as “the 2015 Regulation”). Under Rule 3(1) of the later
               Regulation, it was stipulated that the candidates must study in all classes from Class
               VII to XII in the State of Assam to avail the Assam Quota Seats. Thereafter, by the
               educational notice dated 6.5.2015, the provision was relaxed and made applicable
               for candidates applying for the Combined Entrance Examination or CEE, 2015.
               6.      Those affected by the stipulation for studying in Assam School for availing
               the State Quota Seats, challenged the vires of the amended 2015 Regulation and
               the substitution of Rule 3(1)(c), by the amendment notification dated 30.1.2016.
               The WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury Vs. State of Assam) and other cases
               were analogously decided by the High Court on 28.9.2016 and the Division Bench
               declared the classification to be irrational, legally discriminatory and violative of
               Article 14. It was accordingly held that Rule 3(1)(c) as amended in 2016 cannot be
               invoked, to deny admission, to the concerned aspirants.
               7.      In supersession of the 2015 Regulation, the Admission Rules, 2017 was
               gazetted on 11.7.2017 and as earlier noted, the stipulation of studies in Assam
               Schools under Rule 3(1)(c), is again obstructing the admission of the aspirants to
               the State quota seats, in the session 2017.

               8.                 RELEVANT DATES FOR 2017 ADMISSION.
                       30.01.2017- CBSE issued Notification for NEET (UG) Examination for
                                     admission to MBBS/BDS Courses, for the session 2017 –

                                     apply through NEET (UG) 2017 conducted by the CBSE. The
                                     candidates were also advised to visit the CBSE Website for
                                     Online application and also to gather information on other

                                     inviting applications from those in the Assam State Merit List,
                                     indicating the Reserve Category Seats for 12 groups and
                                     specifying the schedule for admission with first round
                                     counselling, commencing on 16.7.2017.
                       11.07.2017- Admission Notice issued by the DME, Assam specifying the

                       11.07.2017- Gazette Notification bringing into force the Admission Rules
                                     2017.
                                           PETITIONERS’ ARGUMENT
               9.1     Referring to the above dates, the petitioners contend that the admission
               process for the session 2017 commenced with the CBSE’s notification dated
               30.1.2017 and the DME’s notification of 8.2.2017. With the declaration of the NEET
               result on 23.6.2017 and the release of the State Merit List on 1.7.2017 (based on
               NEET examination performance) and also the Educational Notice dated 3.7.2017
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                          Page 4 of 14

               notifying the dates of counselling for the State Quota Seats, the rights to secure
               admission for this year’s medical seats got crystalized. Therefore it is argued that
               the change of the eligibility criteria with the Admission Rules, 2017 enforced on
               11.7.2017, cannot disturb the already crystalized rights of the petitioners.
               9.2      Mr. K.N. Choudhury, the learned Senior counsel submits that the Admission
               Rules, 2017 notified midway through the process, cannot be applied for to the 2017
               session as the disability attached for the aspirants, under Rule 3(1)(c) of the
               recently notified Rules, 2017, should not effect those, who started their admission
               quest, well before the new Rules were notified.
               9.3      The norms of admission to the State Medical Colleges have been changed
               from time to time and the petitioners contend that when the admission process
               commenced for the session 2017, the Medical Colleges of Assam, Regional Dental
               College, Guwahati and the Government Ayurvedic College, Guwahati (Regulation of
               Admission of Under-Graduate Students) Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as “the
               2007 Regulation”) was made the basis of admission in 2015 where, the eligibility
               criteria was specified under Rule 3(2)(c), as under -
                        “…………………..
                        (c)    unless he/she has completed minimum of 4 years schooling either at (i)
                               HSLC or equivalent stage or (ii) HSLC and HSSLC or equivalent stages
                               combined from the recognized schools conducting regular classes situated
                               within the State of Assam.
                               Provided if the candidate has not done 4 years of schooling in the State then
                               their Father or Mother must have completed his/her schooling in the State
                               for minimum 4 years in HSLC level and they must furnish the certificate
                               listed in the Annexure-II whichever is applicable, in order for their
                               son/daughter to be eligible to appear in the Common Entrance Examination
                               for any of the Courses.
                               Provided further that nothing contained in the clause shall be applicable to
                               the sons and daughters of the officers of All India Services allotted to
                               Assam.”
               9.4      The 2007 Regulation was superseded by the 2015 Regulation which in turn
               was amended on 30.1.2016 through substitution of Rules 3(1)(c). Since under the
               judgment dated 28.9.2016 in the WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury vs. State
               of Assam and others), the Division Bench struck down Rule 3(1)(c) substituted by
               2016 amendment in the 2015 Regulation, the eligibility criteria specified in the 2007
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                                 Page 5 of 14

               Regulation, was followed by the respondents. Hence it is argued that for this year’s
               admission, the norms in the Educational Notice of 6.5.2015 should govern, the
               admission for the 2017 session and the Admission Rules, 2017 gazetted on
               11.7.2017, cannot be applied to deny admission for the aspirants, in the current
               session.
                                          RESPONDENTS’ ARGUMENT
               10.1    On the other hand, Mr. D. Saikia, the learned Addl. Advocate General
               submits that the admission process for the State Quota Seats commenced only on
               11.7.2017, when the admission notice was issued by the DME, Assam and since the
               Admission Rules 2017 was also gazetted on the same date i.e. 11.7.2017, the
               respondents argue that the eligibility criteria prescribed under Rule 3(1)(c) of the
               Admission Rules, 2017, should apply for the 2017 session also.
               10.2    The learned Addl. Advocate General refers to sub-rule (2) of Rule 1 to
               project that the Admission Rules, 2017 was made applicable from the academic
               session 2017 itself and accordingly it is argued that it is not a case of retrospective
               application of the norms. Moreover since the norms have been simultaneously
               notified with the admission notice, the admission for the State Quota Seats must be
               made, on the basis of the norms in the Admission Rules, 2017.
               10.3    The respondents contend that the eligibility of the aspirants must be judged
               on the date of the admission notice i.e. 11.7.2017 and participation in the NEET
               (UG) 2017 examination and securing their respective ranks as per the result
               declared on 23.6.2017, will not entitle the aspirants to claim admission on the basis
               of the norms prevalent prior to 11.7.2017.
               10.4    The respondents claim that success in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination
               merely qualifies an aspirant for admission for MBBS/BDS seats but the merit in the
               entrance test will not confer any vested right for admission, for the State Quota
               Seats and the learned Addl. A.G. compares the NEET examination with the TET
               examination, the success in which, does not guarantee a job but it is only a
               qualifying barrier.
               10.5    According to the respondents the Admission Rules, 2017 have been notified
               in exercise of the executive powers of the State under Article 162 of the
               Constitution and projecting the Admission Rules to be a case of subordinate
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                             Page 6 of 14

               legislation, the learned Addl. Advocate General argues that such subordinate
               legislation can also be enacted, with retrospective effect.
               10.6     The learned Addl. A.G. submits that when the High Court struck down the
               Rule 3(1)(c) as substituted on 30.1.2016 in the 2015 Regulation, under the
               judgment dated 28.9.2016 in the WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury Vs. State
               of Assam and others), the admission to the concerned litigants was granted without
               disqualifying them for having done their schooling (Class-VI to Class-X) in outside
               Assam Schools, only because of the direction issued by the Court in paragraph 18 of
               the judgment dated 28.9.2016. But for this mandamus of the Court, the Rule
               3(1)(c) as originally enacted of the 2015 Regulation, should have governed the
               admission of those litigants. As the Division Bench had quashed only the substituted
               Rule 3(1)(c) incorporated by the amendment notification dated 30.1.2016 but the
               original Rule 3(1)(c) before substitution in the 2015 Regulation, remained intact, Mr.
               Saikia argues that if the Admission Rules, 2017 does not apply for the current
               session, the aspirants will have to satisfy the requirement of Rule 3(1)(c) of the
               2015 Regulation.
                                          DISCUSSION AND DECISION
               11.      The admission notice issued on 30.1.2017 by the CBSE indicated that as per
               amendment made in 2016 to the Indian Medical Counsel Act, 1956 (hereinafter
               referred to as the “MCI Act”), admission to all seats of MBBS/BDS Courses will be
               done through NEET (UG) 2017 examination and all categories of seats, including
               State Government Quota Seats, will be filled up through this process. The eligibility
               criteria for appearing in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination was specified and it was
               stated that admission including those for the Reserve Categories will be considered,
               on the basis of the marks obtained in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination. The CBSE
               was required to provide the entrance examination results to the admitting
               authorities who are to invite application for counselling, as per the merit list, drawn
               up on the basis of ranking in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.
               12.      The Section 10D inserted on 14.8.2016 to the MCI Act, introduced the
               uniform mode of medical admission and the same being relevant, is extracted
               hereinbelow for ready reference :
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                            Page 7 of 14

                       “10D. There shall be conducted a uniform entrance examination to all medical
                       educational institutions at the undergraduate level and post-graduate level through
                       such designated authority in Hindi, English and such other languages and in such
                       manner as may be prescribed and the designated authority shall ensure the conduct
                       of uniform entrance examination in the aforesaid manner
                       Provided that notwithstanding any judgment or order of any court, the provisions of
                       this section shall not apply, in relation to the uniform entrance examination at the
                       undergraduate level for the academic year 2016-2017 conducted in accordance with
                       any regulations made under this Act, in respect of the State Government Seats
                       (Whether in Government Medical College or in a private Medical College) when
                       such State has not opted for such examination.”
               13.     The candidates appeared in the Entrance Examination on 7.5.2017 and their
               result was declared on 23.6.2017, whereafter the State Merit List was released on
               1.7.2017. On the basis of their performance in the Entrance Test and their
               respective ranking, the candidates were to be admitted in the 2017 session and
               through the Educational Notice dated 3.7.2017, the schedule for counselling for all
               categories of aspirants, as per the State Merit List was notified by the DME, Assam
               on 3.7.2017. The subsequent Admission Notice of 11.7.2017 in continuation,
               indicated the different dates of counselling as per the ranking in the State Merit List,
               for various categories of aspirants.
               14.     It is important to be aware that the right to secure admission in the 2017
               session, was based entirely on the performance in the Entrance Test and such right
               got crystalized through declaration of NEET (UG) 2017 examination result on
               1.7.2017, followed by the DME’s Educational Notice of 3.7.2017. Now the question
               is whether the Admission Rules, 2017 gazetted on 11.7.2017 should be applied for
               the aspirants, whose right to secure admission perhaps got crystallized, on the basis
               of their performance in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.
               15.     The Admission Rules, 2017 stipulates that it shall come into force when it is
               published in the official gazette and as can be seen, the 2017 Rules was published
               in the Gazette on 11.7.2017. The sub-clause (2) of clause 1 specified that the new
               norms shall be applicable from the academic session 2017 to regulate the admission
               to the MBBS/BDS Courses in the Medical/Dental Colleges of Assam. As earlier noted,
               the admission process for the 2017 session, commenced on 30.1.2017 with the
               CBSE’s notice for the NEET (UG) 2017 examination. The DME, Assam under the
               Education Notice of 8.2.2017, had directed the aspirants from the State, to apply for
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                                Page 8 of 14

               the Assam Quota Seats, through the NEET (UG) 2017 examination conducted by the
               CBSE. Therefore, unless the Admission Rules, 2017 commencing from 11.7.2017 is
               retrospectively applied to the process which started 6 months earlier, the norms
               under the Rule 3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017 cannot be made applicable for
               the aspirants, whose right to admission might have got crystallized, through
               declaration of results in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination on 23.6.2017 based upon
               which, the State Merit List was released on 1.7.2017.
               16.     The Legislature is empowered to enact laws with retrospective operation.
               But here we are not dealing with any legislation but norms formulated by the
               Executive, where the power for retrospective change, would be severely
               circumscribed. Unless the authority of the Executive to make retrospective change
               of norms, is demonstrated without any ambiguity, the Court will not permit
               extinguishment of vested right through executive fiat.
               17.     To understand the principles of retrospective operation, we can be guided by
               the ratio in The Income Tax Officer, Alleppy, vs. M.C. Ponnoose and Others reported
               in (1969)2 SCC 351, where the court observed as follows –
                       “……………….
                       Now it is open to a sovereign legislature to enact laws which have retrospective
                       operation. Even when the Parliament enacts retrospective laws such laws are - in the
                       words of Willes, J. in Phillips v. Eyre (40 Law J. Rep (N.S.) Q.B. 28 at p.37) - 'no
                       doubt prima facie of questionable policy and contrary to the general principle that
                       legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought, when
                       introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the
                       character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.' The
                       courts will not, therefore, ascribe retrospectivity to new laws affecting rights unless
                       by express words or necessary implication it appears that such was the intention of
                       the legislature. The Parliament can delegate its legislative power within the
                       recognised limits. Where any rule or regulation is made by the person or authority to
                       whom such powers have been delegated by the legislature it may or may not be
                       possible to make the same so as to give retrospective operation. It will depend on the
                       language employed in the statutory provision which may in express terms or by
                       necessary implication empower the authority concerned to make a rule or regulation
                       with retrospective effect. But where no such language is to be found it has been held
                       by the courts that the person or authority exercising subordinate legislative functions
                       cannot make a rule, regulation or bye- law which can operate with retrospective
                       effect
                       …………………..”
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                                    Page 9 of 14

               18.     The above ratio makes it amply clear that the authority to make rules or
               regulation with retrospective impact is circumscribed. Therefore unless the authority
               is vested with specific power, they cannot formulate midstream changes to impact
               vested rights.
               19.     Commenting on presumption of prospective operation of legislation, the
               constitution bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Income
               Tax vs. Vatika Township Private Limited reported in (2015)1 SCC 1, observed that
               the idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern current activities and
               law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past. It is therefore stated that
               the basis of the principle against retrospectivity, is the principle of “fairness” which
               must be the basis of every legal rule. The legislation which modifies accrued right or
               imposes a new disability, have to be treated as prospective unless the legislative
               intent is to give the enactment, a retrospective effect.
               20.     In the present case, the Court is not examining any legislative enactment
               but the Admission Rules, 2017 notified by the government on 11.7.2017 which
               made midstream change, impacting the eligibility for admission in a process which
               commenced 6 months earlier on the basis of the CBSE’s notice for the NEET (UG)
               2017 examination and the notice dated 8.2.2017 of the DME, Assam, for the
               aspirants for the State Quota Seats to appear in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.
               When the aspirants applied for admission by appearing in the NEET (UG) 2017
               examination, they would expect their admission to be considered on the basis of the
               norms applicable on the date, when the process commenced or at least on the date
               when the entrance test result were declared. But what is seen here is that only on
               the eve of starting the counselling process, the new norms were notified. The Court
               will therefore be slow to allow retrospective application of the changed norms.
               21.     The NEET (UG) 2017 examination, in my understanding cannot be equated
               to an eligibility test to apply for admission since it is the performance in the
               entrance test which makes one entitled for admission for the current session. Only
               those who satisfy the education and age criterion specified in the CBSE’s notice for
               the NEET examination, can appear in the entrance test and since the performance
               in the entrance test confers right of admission, the NEET examination cannot be
               equated to an eligibility test like the TET.
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                             Page 10 of 14

               22.     That apart, the result of the NEET (UG) 2017 examination does not have
               indefinite application like the TET result, since performance in the NEET (UG) 2017
               examination will enable admission in the current session only, whereas qualification
               in the TET examination, will enable the successful candidate to apply for teacher’s
               job whenever vacancies accrue. Moreover, the Court cannot be unmindful of the
               fact that NEET (UG) 2017 examination was never intended to be an eligibility test
               since the performance in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination is made the basis for
               admission to MBBS/BDS courses. Therefore arguments made to the contrary by the
               learned Addl. A.G. is not accepted.
               23.     The Admission Rules, 2017 was gazetted on 11.7.2017 and it cannot be
               accepted as piece of delegated legislation, as has been argued by the State. Only on
               the basis of power delegated by a primary legislation, the exercise of power by the
               delegatee can be construed as an exercise of delegated legislative power. But the
               Assam Government has not enacted any law to regulate admission in the
               MBBS/DMS Courses in the Government Colleges and therefore, the Admission Rules,
               2017 cannot be construed to be a legislative enactment.
               24.     The so called Admission Rules that the Court is concerned with in the
               present case, are not framed either under any statutory enactment or under any
               provision of the Constitution. They can at best be considered as administrative
               instruction but certainly not to be construed as Rules under Article 162 of the
               Constitution. The Supreme Court in the case of G.J. Fernandez Vs. State of Mysore
               reported in AIR 1967 SC 1753, while commenting on the executive power of the
               State under Article 162 stated that-
                        “…………………………………..This Article in our opinion merely indicates the
                        scope of the executive power of the State; it does not 'confer any power on the State
                        Government to issue rules thereunder. As a matter of fact wherever the
                        Constitution, envisages issue of rules it has so provided in specific terms. We may,
                        for example, refer to Article 309, the proviso to which lays down in specific terms
                        that the President or the Governor of a State may make rules regulating the
                        recruitment and the conditions ,of service of persons appointed to services and posts
                        under the Union or the State. We are therefore of opinion that Article 162 does not
                        confer any power on the State Government to frame rules and it only indicates the
                        scope of the executive power of the State. Of course, under such executive power,
                        the State can give administrative instructions to its servants how to act in certain
                        circumstances; but that will not make such instructions statutory rules which-are
                        justiciable in certain circumstances. In order that such executive instructions have
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                                  Page 11 of 14

                        the force of statutory rules it must be shown that they have been issued either under
                        the authority conferred on the State Government by some statute or under some
                        provision of the Constitution providing therefore. It is not in dispute that there is no
                        statute which confers any authority on the State Government to issue rules in
                        matters with which the Code is concerned; nor has any provision of the Constitution
                        been pointed' out to us under which these instructions can be issued as statutory
                        rules except Article 162. But as we have already indicated, Article 162 does not
                        confer any authority on the State Government to issue statutory rules. It only
                        provides for the extent and scope of the executive power of the State Government,
                        and that coincides with the legislative power of the State legislature. Thus under
                        Article 162, the State Government can take executive action in all matters in which
                        the legislature of the State can pass laws. But Article 162 itself does not confer any
                        rule making power on the State Government in that behalf. We are therefore of
                        opinion that instructions contained in the Code are mere administrative instructions
                        and are not statutory rules……………”
               25.     In the context of Rule 1(2) of the Admission Rules, 2017 urged by the
               learned Addl. A.G., the Executive made Rules one must understand, stand on a
               much weaker footing. The power of the legislature to prescribe norms
               retrospectively, is not available with the executive. Therefore the executive made
               Rules cannot be allowed to retrospectively destroy any vested right, as was held in
               Uday Pratap Singh Vs. State of Bihar reported in 1994 Suppl. (3) SCC 451. The ratio
               of this verdict of the Supreme Court applies here.
               26.     The notice issued by the DME, Assam on 8.2.2017 clearly reflected that all
               aspirants for the Assam Quote MBBS/BDS Seats should apply through the NEET
               (UG) 2017 examination, to be conducted by the CBSE and therefore, there is no
               ambiguity on commencing the process of admission for the session 2017, well
               before the Admission Rules, 2017 was gazetted on 11.7.2017. Therefore I am of the
               considered opinion that obstruction to admission cannot be caused under Rule
               3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017 for those, who might have acquired their right
               of admission, on the basis of their performance in the entrance examination and the
               publication of the State Merit List on 1.7.2017.
               27.     Consequently, if the admission for the 2017 session is not to be governed by
               the Admission Rules, 2017, the question is which norm will govern the admission of
               the aspirants, who appeared in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination. For answering
               this issue, one has to take into account that this Court under the judgment dated
               28.9.2016 in the WP(C) No.4904/2016 (Hiralal Choudhury Vs. State of Assam and
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                                   Page 12 of 14

               others), struck down the substituted Rule under the amendment notification of
               30.1.2016 in the 2015 Regulation. It is relevant to note that Rule 3(1)(c) as
               originally incorporated in the 2015 Regulation, is not touched by any judgment of
               the High Court. Therefore when the substituted Rule 3(1)(c) under the amended
               notification of 30.1.2016 was struck down, the admission for the litigants should
               have been considered under the originally enacted Rule 3(1)(c) of the 2015
               Regulation. But this was not done only because of the mandamus issued by the
               Court in paragraph 18 of the judgment dated 28.9.2016 in Hiralal Choudhury
               (supra). Therefore, it rationally follows that the 2015 Regulation should govern the
               admission, in the current year. It is accordingly held that the 2015 Regulation must
               be the basis for admission, in the current year for those, who applied for admission,
               by appearing in the NEET (UG) 2017 examination.
               28.     The Rule 3(1)(c) of the 2015 Regulation being relevant is extracted
               hereinbelow:-
                        “………………………….
                        3.     Eligibility for appearing in the Common Entrance Examination for
                               admission.-
                               The following conditions must be fulfilled.-
                               (1)(a) ……………………
                               (b)      ……………………
                               (c)      The candidate including son/daughters of officers of All India
                                        Services must study in all classes from Class-VII to XII in the State
                                        of Assam and must pass the qualifying examination from the
                                        Institutes situated in Assam. (Certificate at Annexure-II in
                                        Application Form B at Schedule-I of these rules must be submitted if
                                        a candidate is called for counseling):
                                       Provided that if a candidate studies outside Assam from Class-VII
                                       onwards because his/her father/mother is posted outside Assam as a
                                       State Government employee on deputation or transfer or regular
                                       posting then the period for which father/mother is working outside
                                       the State shall be relaxable for such candidate. (Certificate of
                                       employment of father/mother outside the state indicating the period
                                       of service must be submitted if a candidate is called for counseling).
                       ………………………….”
               29.     In the above context, the admission granted under the 2007 Regulation
               under DME’s notice of 6.5.2015, has no connection with the Court’s later judgment
               dated 28.9.2016 in Hiralal Choudhury (supra). Therefore, the submission made by
               the petitioners that in the event the Admission Rules, 2017 is not to be applied, the
WP(C) 4058/2017                                                                                   Page 13 of 14

               2007 Regulation will govern the admission, in the current session, is not acceptable.
               This is because the 2007 Regulation was superseded by the 2015 Regulation and it
               will be illogical to revert back to the already superseded norms, when the
               Regulation 2015 as originally enacted, has remained valid.
               30.      The Supreme Court in Dolly Chhanda Vs. Chairman, JEE reported in (2005)9
               SCC 779 had declared that while applying for any course of study, the person must
               possess the eligibility qualification on the last date for application. The period for
               application for this year’s admission was scheduled during 30.1.2017 to 1.3.2017
               and hence the eligibility for the petitioner must be with reference to the last date of
               application i.e. 1.3.2017. Therefore, the admission must be granted on the basis of
               the norms, prevalent on the date when the aspirants could last apply and logically
               therefore, the new Rules cannot apply for admission in the current session.
               31.      Following the above conclusion, the respondents are directed to ensure
               admission to the State Quota Seats for the petitioners to the MBBS/BDS courses in
               the 2017 session, in accordance with their respective ranking in the entrance test.
               As the mop-up round by the admission authorities is scheduled between 26th – 28th
               August 2017 as per the Educational Notice dated 3.7.2017 of the DME, the
               respondents should re-determine the eligibility with reference to the 2015
               Regulation and then allow admission of the eligible aspirants without enforcing the
               Rule 3(1)(c) of the Admission Rules, 2017, against them. However it is made clear
               that the norms under the 2015 Regulation will have to be satisfied by the aspirants.
               It is ordered accordingly.
               32.      With the above order, the case stands allowed in the manner indicated. No
               cost.
                                                                                    JUDGE
