2.      The core issue, which calls for our consideration, is whether in the fact
situation of the case, the respondents, who are Muster Roll workers, Work
Charged workers and Casual workers, are entitled for regularization of their
services with consequential benefits such as pension etc.
3.      In several engineering and works related Departments of the State, a
muster roll of workers is maintained in addition to the employees working in the
regular cadre and such workers are known as Muster Roll Workers. Likewise,
there is another category of workers, whose tenure of service with pay and
allowances are charged to a particular ongoing work and they are commonly
known as Work Charged employees. Apart from these two categories, several
departments of the State also employ a large number of Casual Workers
including Fixed Pay and Daily Rated Workers.
4.      On 23.9.1983, a Cabinet decision was taken by the State Government to
regularize the services of all Muster Roll Workers, who have completed 15 years
of service or more as Class III employees. Thereafter, the Chief Secretary of the
State vide communication dated 15.3.1984 also informed the General Secretary
of the Public Works Department Employees Union that Muster Roll workers of
the Public Works Department and other Engineering Departments, who have
completed 15 years of continuous service, will be regularized with effect from
1.8.1984. By the same communication, the Union was further informed that
Work Charged workers of the Engineering Departments, who have completed 5
years of continuous service, shall be brought under the regular establishment.
However, no Scheme was prepared providing the procedure to implement the
Cabinet decision.
5.      And after about 9 years, the Chief Secretary, vide communication dated
20.4.1995, apprised all the concerned authorities that despite Cabinet decision,
                                                                     Page 2 of 12

the services of the Muster Roll and Work Charged workers were not being
regularized. He also directed all the Departments to take necessary action in
consultation with the Finance Department for early regularization of the services
of Muster Roll and Work Charged workers, who were engaged prior to 1.4.1993.
This communication was followed by an Office Memorandum dated 11.10.1995
issuing strict instructions to all concerned not to engage any further Muster
Roll/Work Charged workers after 1.4.1993. On 13.10.1995, another clarification
was issued to the effect that Office Memorandum dated 20.4.1995 was to
operate provided the Muster Roll/Work Charged workers were not discharged or
terminated on or before 20.4.1995.
6.      It is relevant to mention here that in various writ petitions filed by Muster
Roll/Work Charged workers, this Court has even directed the State Government
to regularize such category of workers in terms of above mentioned               Office
Memorandum dated 20.4.1995.
7.      But, later, on the issue regarding regularization of employees working in
Grade III posts in the Transport Department, one case of Jitendra Kalita vs.
State of Assam was referred to Full Bench of this Court which held that Office
Memorandum dated 20.4.1995 did not reflect a valid policy decision of the State
on regularization of Muster Roll/Work Charged workers. The Full Bench although
did not disturb those already regularized on the strength of Office Memorandum
dated 20.4.1995, it made clear that there would be no further regularization in
terms of the Office Memorandum. The Full Bench decision is dated 17.5.2006
and reported in 2006(2) GLT 654 and we shall hereinafter refer it as “Jitendra
Kalita Case”.
8.      Interestingly, on 14.11.2005, during the course of hearing of Jitendra
Kalita’s case, the Chief Secretary filed an affidavit stating therein that on
22.7.2005, the State Government had taken another Cabinet decision to
regularize the services of Muster Roll/Work Charged workers, who were engaged
prior to 1.4.1993 and the Full Bench did not express any opinion on the Cabinet
decision dated 22.7.2005. Also, following the Cabinet decision, the State
                                                                          Page 3 of 12

Government created large number of posts and is reported to have regularized
as many as 30,000 (thirty thousand) Muster Roll/Work Charged workers.
9.     Also in WP(C) No.2186/2007 and WP(C) No.2384/2007, a Single Judge
Bench, vide order dated 21.5.2008, allowed the relief of pension and family
pension in favour of Muster Roll/Work Charged workers, who were engaged prior
to 1.4.1993 and had retired. However, another Single Judge Bench, in Review
Petition No.124/2012, vide order dated 14.3.2013, relying upon the decision of
the Supreme Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4
SCC 1, held that relief of pension and family pension is impermissible to such
workers.
10.    In yet another group of cases, the lead case being WP(C) No.1271/2006
(Ramani Deka vs. State of Assam), wherein this court was considering the issue
of regularization of services of the Muster Roll/Work Charged workers engaged
prior to 1.4.1993, a statement was made by the State Government on 6.9.2010
that a policy to regularize the services of such workers within 3(three) months is
under active consideration. And the Court, on the same date, directed the
Government to implement its policy.
11.    In one Suo Motu case, being WP(C) (Taken Up) No.24/2007, a Division
Bench of this court was considering the conditions of Prisons in the State,
including engagement of adequate staff and other related issues and vide order
dated 30.7.2010 it directed the State Government to frame policy for
regularization of Casual Workers in terms of the Full Bench decision in the case
of Jitendra Kalita. But, on 1.11.2010, when the Additional Advocate General
informed the Court about the statement made in the case of Ramani Deka
(supra) regarding consideration of policy to regularize the services of Muster
Roll/Work Charged workers within three months, the Division Bench observed
that no further steps need be taken pursuant to direction issued on 30.7.2010.
12.    On 14.12.2011 also when the case of Ramani Deka was taken up, a
statement was made on behalf of the Finance Department that the matter of
regularization was under active consideration in co-ordination with the
                                                                       Page 4 of 12

Departments of Health, PWD, Directorate of Zoology and Mining, Water Resource
etc. and the benefit of the deliberation was likely to be positive in favour of the
petitioners therein.
13.    However, notwithstanding the above statement made before the Court,
the State Government filed MC No.597/2012 in WP(C) (Taken Up) No.24/2007
seeking leave to implement its policy of regularization and the Division Bench,
having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court in Umadevi case, vide order
dated 27.3.2012, declined to grant the leave. Immediately, thereafter, the
Finance Department, Government of Assam, issued Office Memorandum dated
16.6.2012 stating therein that there shall be no further regularization of services
of Muster Roll/Work Charged or similarly placed workers, even if such workers
were engaged prior to 1.4.1993. The Office Memorandum dated 16.6.2012 also
stated that there would be no more regularization by creating supernumerary
posts for one day in respect of those Muster Roll/Work Charged workers, who
were engaged prior to 1.4.1993, but have died or had attained the age of
superannuation.
14.    The respondents claim themselves to be Muster Roll/Work Charged
workers engaged prior to 1.4.1993. Their grievance is that for some reason or
the other, their cases were not considered by the State Government for
regularization in the light of its Cabinet decision dated 22.7.2005. Feeling
aggrieved, they, therefore, filed writ petitions for directing the State Government
to regularize their services. Some of the respondents, who were engaged prior to
1.4.1993 and have retired, prayed that they be paid pension or family pension by
creating supernumerary posts to the incumbents and regularizing their services
for one day. The respondents also challenged the validity of Office Memorandum
dated 16.6.2012. Surprisingly, none of the respondents challenged the above
mentioned order dated 27.3.2012 of the Division Bench passed in MC
No.597/2012 declining leave to implement the policy of regularisation.
15.    The learned Single Judge having regard to the undertaking given by the
State Government before the Court and the exception carved out in paragraph
53 of the Umadevi case to regularize those employees who have worked for
                                                                         Page 5 of 12

more than 10 years as a one-time measure which was also later explained by the
Supreme Court in State of Karnataka vs. M.L.Kesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247 has
directed the appellant State Government to consider regularization of the
services of respondents in terms of Cabinet decision taken on 22.7.2005 by
framing an appropriate policy/scheme. The learned Single Judge has also
observed that there was no bar for creating supernumerary post and
regularization for one day of the Muster Roll, Work Charged and similar category
of  employees      engaged prior       to    1.4.1993    after  attaining   the    age    of
superannuation or in case of death for the purposes of grant of pensionary
benefits. The learned Single Judge has even quashed the Office Memorandum
dated 16.6.2012 issued by the appellant pursuant to order dated 27.3.2012
passed by the Division Bench in MC No.597/2012.
16.    It is in this background, we shall examine whether the respondents who
are working as Muster Roll/Work Charged employees prior to 1.4.1993 can be
considered for regularization in the light of exception carved out in paragraph 53
of the decision in Umadevi case. For ready reference, paragraph 53 is
reproduced as under:-
               “One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular
               appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in S.V.
               Narayanappa, R.N. Nanjundappa and B.N. Nagarajan and referred to in
               para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts
               might have been made and the employees have continued to work for
               ten years or more but without the intervention of orders of the Courts or
               of tribunals. The question of regularization of the services of such
               employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the
               principles settled by this Court in the cases above referred to and in the
               light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State
               Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularize
               as a onetime measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who
               have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under
               cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure
               that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned
               posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or
               daily wagers are being now employed. The process must be set in motion
               within six months from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any
               already made, but not sub-judice, need not be reopened based on this
               judgment, but there should be no further by passing of the constitutional
                                                                              Page 6 of 12

             requirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly
             appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”
17.   Also the term “one-time measure” as explained by the Supreme Court in
paragraphs 9,10 and 11 in M.L.Kesari case read as under:-
              “9.The term “one-time measure” has to be understood in its proper
             perspective. This would normally mean that after the decision in
             Umadevi(3), each department or each instrumentality should undertake a
             one-time exercise and prepare a list of all casual, daily-wage or ad-hoc
             employees who have been working for more than ten years without the
             intervention of Courts and tribunals and subject them to a process
             verification as to whether they are working against vacant posts and
             possess the requisite qualification for the post and if so, regularise their
             services.
             10.At the end of six months from the date of decision in Umadevi(3),
             cases of several daily-wage/ad-hoc/casual employees were still pending
             before Courts. Consequently, several departments and instrumentalities
             did not commence the one time regularization process. On the other
             hand, some government departments or instrumentalities undertook the
             onetime exercise excluding several employees from consideration either
             on the ground that their cases were pending in Courts or due to sheer
             oversight. In such circumstances, the employees who were entitled to be
             considered in terms of para 53 of the decision in Umadevi(3), will not lose
             their right to be considered for regularisation, merely because the one-
             time exercise was completed without considering their cases, or because
             the six-month period mentioned in para 53 of Umadevi(3), has expired.
             The one-time exercise should consider all daily-wage/ad-hoc/casual
             employees who had put in 10 years of continuous service as on 10-04-
             2006 without availing the protection of any interim orders of Courts or
             tribunals. If any employer had held the one-time exercise in terms of
             para 53 of Umadevi(3), but did not consider the cases of some
             employees who were entitled to the benefit of para 53 of Umadevi(3), the
             employer concerned should consider their cases also, as a continuation of
             the onetime exercise. The one-time exercise will be concluded only when
             all the employees who are entitled to be considered in terms of para 53
             of Umadevi(3), are so considered.”
             11. The object behind the said direction in para 53 of Umadevi(3), is
             twofold. First is to ensure that those who have put in more than ten
             years of continuous service without the protection of any interim orders
             of Courts or tribunals, before the date of decision in Umadevi(3) was
             rendered, are considered for regularisation in view of their long service.
             Second is to ensure that the departments/ instrumentalities do not
             perpetuate the practice of employing persons on daily wage/ad-
                                                                           Page 7 of 12

               hoc/casual basis for long periods and then periodically regularise them on
               the ground that they have served for more than ten years, thereby
               defeating the constitutional or statutory provisions relating to recruitment
               and appointment. The true effect of the direction is that all persons who
               have worked for more than ten years as on 10-04-2006 [the date of
               decision in Umadevi(3)] without the protection of any interim order of
               any Court or tribunal, in vacant posts, possessing the requisite
               qualification, are entitled to be considered for regularization. The fact that
               the employer has not undertaken such exercise of regularization within
               six months of the decision in Umadevi(3), or that such exercise was
               undertaken only in regard to a limited few, will not disentitle such
               employees, the right to be considered for regularization in terms of the
               above directions in Umadevi(3) as a one-time measure”.
18.     The Supreme Court in Umadevi case, but for exception carved out in
paragraph 53 of the decision, has issued a Mandamus that henceforth, no
regularization shall be made bypassing the constitutional requirement or making
permanent, those not duly appointed as per the Constitutional scheme. And,
after 10.4.2006, on which date, judgment of Umadevi was delivered, the State
Government has not regularized the services of any Muster Roll/Work Charged
worker or an employee of similar category whose appointment was either illegal
or was not made on duly sanctioned vacant post. Also what is explained by the
Supreme Court in the case of M.L.Kesari is that if, for some reason, the
employees, who were entitled to the benefit of paragraph 53 of the decision in
Umadevi were not considered, they will not lose their right to be considered for
regularization merely because the one-time exercise was completed without
considering their cases or because the six months period mentioned therein has
expired. In paragraph 53 of the decision in Umadevi, it is held in unequivocal
terms that only irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) of duly
qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts, who have worked for 10 years
or more in duly sanctioned posts without cover of orders of the courts or of
tribunals be considered for regularization as one-time measure within six
months. According to the State Government, not one respondent was either
appointed on a sanctioned vacant post or is working against a sanctioned vacant
post. And, it is for these reasons, the State Government, despite having framed a
policy to regularize the Muster Roll, Work Charged employees working prior to
                                                                                Page 8 of 12

1.4.1993, sought leave of this Court to implement the same in MC No.597/2012,
which was rightly declined by the Division Bench, vide order dated 27.3.2012.
The learned Single Judge overlooked the fact that respondents were not
appointed on duly sanctioned vacant posts and are also not working on duly
sanctioned posts, while directing the State Government to consider their cases
for regularization. The impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge is,
therefore, not in tune with the decision of the Supreme Court in Umadevi case
and hence, cannot be sustained. After Umadevi case, the State Government also
cannot create posts to regularize the services of Muster Roll/Work Charged
employees as none of them are working against sanctioned posts. And for filling
up the sanctioned vacant posts or newly created posts, the State will have to
adopt a normal procedure of recruitment by giving opportunity to all qualified
and eligible persons to participate in the recruitment process.
19.    It is true that the State Government took a Cabinet decision on 22.7.2005
to regularize the services of Muster Roll/Work Charged workers who were
engaged prior to 1.4.1993 and pursuant to which, the State Government
regularized the services of large number of such workers after creating posts.
The respondents, therefore, also claim for the same benefit of Cabinet decision
by invoking the theory of legitimate expectation and taking a plea that they
cannot be subjected to discrimination with those similarly placed workers, whose
services have been regularized. Even this issue submission has been answered in
Umadevi       case against the respondents. Its relevant paragraph 47 reads as
under:-
            “47. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as
            a contractual or casual worker and the engagement is not based on a proper
            selection as recognized by the relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the
            consequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in
            nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for
            being confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be made
            only by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases concerned, in
            consultation with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the theory of
            legitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced by temporary,
            contractual or casual employees. It cannot also be held that the State has
            held out any promise while engaging these persons either to continue them
            where they are or to make them permanent. The State cannot
                                                                              Page 9 of 12

           constitutionally make such a promise. It is also obvious that the theory
           cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of being made permanent in the
           post.”
20.    In the above quoted paragraph 47 of the decision in Umadevi case, the
Supreme Court has clearly held that when a person enters a temporary
employment or gets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the
engagement is not based on a proper selection as recognized by the relevant
rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment being
temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such a person cannot invoke the
theory of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post when an
appointment to the post could be made only by following a proper procedure for
selection. According to the Supreme Court, the theory of legitimate expectation
cannot be successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or casual employees.
The Supreme Court has also held that the State cannot constitutionally make a
promise to such employees for making their services permanent. And, as
mentioned above, after Umadevi case, the State Government has not regularized
any similarly situated workers notwithstanding the Cabinet decision and the
statements made before the Court regarding regularization of their services. We,
therefore,   reject   the   respondents’  plea    of    legitimate expectation    and
discrimination.
21.    Lastly, the respondents have cited decisions of the Supreme Court in Nihal
Singh vs. State of Punjab, (2013) 14 SCC 65, Malathi Das vs. Suresh, (2014) 13
SCC 249 and Yashwant Arjun More vs. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 13 SCC 264
to convince us that even after Umadevi case, the Supreme Court has directed for
regularization even by creating posts although the employees were not working
on sanctioned posts. But these decisions are on different facts and the Supreme
Court itself has held that the ratio decidendi of Umadevi case was not applicable
to them. In the case of Nihal Singh vs. State of Punjab (supra), Special Police
Officers were appointed under Section 17 of the Police Act to meet the law and
order problem. The appointments of Special Police Officers were made in
accordance with the statutory procedure contemplated under the Act, but their
services were not being regularized on the ground that there were no sanctioned
                                                                         Page 10 of 12

posts. The Supreme Court held that since the initial appointments of such Special
Police Officers was made legally under a statute, it cannot be categorized as
irregular much less illegal appointment and therefore the principles laid down in
Umadevi case were not applicable. It is in this fact situation the Supreme Court
directed the State Government to absorb the Special Police Officers by creating
necessary posts. Besides this, in Nihal Singh the Supreme Court was not dealing
with the issue of regularization of Muster Roll/Work Charged employees like the
respondents. In Malathi Das vs. Suresh (supra) the Supreme Court in a
Contempt Petition merely directed the authorities to comply with the order of the
High Court to regularize the employees. The High Court order for regularization
was admittedly passed and affirmed by the Supreme Court much prior to the
decision of Umadevi. The decision of Umadevi was thus clearly not applicable in
the case of Malathi Das. In Yashwant Arjun More vs. State of Maharashtra
(supra) also non salaried copyists were working in the Revenue and Forest
Department of the Government of Maharashtra continuously for 10 or more
years and they could not apply for regularization because neither the required
examination was held by the Department nor the Staff Selection Board was
constituted. The State Government therefore to overcome its lapse decided to
absorb such non-salaried copyists on available vacant posts subject to their
making applications and holding required educational qualifications. The
Supreme Court took note of the fact that non-salaried copyists were victims of
the lapse of State Government and held that the ratio of judgment in Umadevi
cannot be invoked for denying them the benefit of decision of the State
Government to absorb them through a selection process. In the case at hand,
there is no provision of holding examination of the respondents by any Selection
Board for the purposes of their regularization and hence, the State Government
cannot be blamed for any lapse. Hence, the decisions cited by the respondents
do not help them.
22.    It is, however, heartening to learn that the State Government has agreed
not to terminate the Muster Roll, Work Charged and similarly placed employees
working since last more than 10 years (not in sanctioned post) till their normal
retirement, except on disciplinary ground or on ground of criminal offences. The
                                                                      Page 11 of 12

State Government has also agreed to enlist such employees in Health and
Accidental and Death Insurance Scheme, which will be prepared in consultation
with the State Cabinet. We appreciate this positive stand of the State
Government taken as welfare measures for the betterment and security of the
employees, in question. We, accordingly, direct the State Government to
implement the measures without further delay. Besides this, we, in the light of
decision of the Supreme Court in State of Punjab vs. Jagjit Singh, (2017) 1 SCC
148, also direct the State Government to pay minimum of the pay scale to
Muster Roll workers, Work Charged workers and similarly placed employees
working since last more than 10 years (not in sanctioned post) with effect from
1.8.2017.
23.    For these reasons, we are of the view that in the fact situation of the
case, Muster Roll workers, Work Charged workers and Casual workers are not
entitled for regularization of their services with consequential benefits, such as,
pension etc. We, accordingly, subject to our direction in paragraph 22 of the
judgment, allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order
dated 20.12.2013 passed by the learned Single Judge.
