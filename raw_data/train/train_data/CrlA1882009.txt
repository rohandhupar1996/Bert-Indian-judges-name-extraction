                                JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
                   This is appeal under Section 378 of the IPC against the judgment,
     dated 03.09.2009, passed in CR No. 517C/2004 dismissing the complaint
        Crl. A. No. 188 of 2009                                                    Page 1 of 3

by the learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate No. II (S) Kamrup at
Guwahati.
2.             The prosecution case is that on 11.02.2001, the complainant
entered into an agreement for purchase of a part of the 2nd floor of a four
storied RCC building alongwith independent car parking place in the
ground floor, owned and possessed by the accused. On 21.08.2001 the
accused         executed      a    registered   sale  deed    in   favour      of      the
complainant/appellant after receiving the consideration fixed between the
parties. The accused/respondent delivered the possession of the part of the
2nd floor to the appellant as per agreement, although did not provide the
space       for      parking    his   car.   While   the   appellant     insisted      the
accused/respondent to deliver the possession of the car-parking place also,
initially        he       avoided,     and    thereafter,   he     threatened          the
appellant/complainant on 22.02.2004.
3.             The learned Trial Court, after hearing both sides, framed a final
charge under Sections 418/423 of the IPC against the accused/respondent.
The complainant examined only one witness as PW1, i.e., himself.
4.             Heard Mr. SC Biswas, learned counsel for the appellant. None
appears for the respondent.
5.             It has come out from the evidence of the appellant/complainant,
as PW1, before the learned Trial Court that he was provided with the car-
parking place, which was vacant at the time of his taking possession of the
2nd floor of the building as per the sale deed.
6.             That being the evidence, there is no issue left in respect of
providing the car-parking place. The evidence in this respect is very much
clear that at the time of handing over possession of the 2nd floor of the
building,        car     parking   place    was   vacant  for    possession     of     the
    Crl. A. No. 188 of 2009                                                Page 2 of 3

complainant/appellant and that was also indicated in the deed of
agreement for sale.
7.             In view of the above, the learned Trial Court recorded the order
of acquittal, based on the evidence on record. That apart, the complaint
itself alongwith the evidence of the complainant, as PW1, makes it appear
that whole process leading to the fact of this case is a sale deed executed
between both the parties on payment of consideration. The consideration
fixed was paid by the appellant/complainant and possession of the 2nd floor
of the building was also handed over to him as per agreement keeping the
car parking place vacant for him.
8.             That being the position, the complainant was not able to proof
the case at all. Therefore, the order, recording acquittal by the learned Trial
Court, appears to be based on the evidence on record, and therefore,
needs no interference.
9.             Accordingly, the appeal stands dismissed.
10.            Send back the LCR alongwith a copy of this judgment.
                                                                      JUDGE
