                       3
3.       The   challenge    in   this   group   of
appeals is to an order of the Gauhati High
Court dated 28th February, 2017 by which
document No.xiii (i.e. Certificate issued
by the Secretary of the Village Panchayat
and  countersigned     by  the    local   revenue
official in respect of females who have
migrated to other villages after marriage
or     such     certificates        issued      by
jurisdictional circle officers in respect
of   urban     areas)     mentioned      in    the
'illustrative       list       of       documents
admissible' as a supporting document has
been held by the High Court to be invalid
in  law   and  hence   of   no   effect   in   the
process   of   verification     of   claims    for
inclusion in the NRC.       The High Court had
passed   the   aforesaid    order    in   a   writ
proceeding    [i.e.   Writ   Petition     (Civil)
No.2634 of 2016 (Monowara Bewa @ Manora
Bewa  Vs.   The   Union   of   India    &   Ors.)]

                      4
wherein the validity of an order of the
Foreigners    Tribunal    holding    the   writ
petitioner – Monowara Bewa @ Manora Bewa
to be a foreigner was in question.          The
High Court found the contentions advanced
in  the  writ   petition  to  be  without   any
merit and substance and the order of the
Tribunal,   on   the   materials   before   it,
holding   the  writ   petitioner   –   Monowara
Bewa @ Manora Bewa to be a foreigner to be
justified in law.
4.       The   writ   petitioner   –   Monowara
Bewa @ Manora Bewa in support of her claim
to be an Indian citizen had additionally
laid before the High Court a certificate
issued by the Gaon Panchayat Secretary of
the kind noticed above.       The High Court
could have and, in fact, had decided the
writ   petition    on   the   basis    of   the
materials laid before the Tribunal without

                       5
adverting to the aforesaid certificate and
on that basis could have terminated the
proceedings      in   question.      However,   the
High Court took the view that the question
of validity of the certificate issued by
the  G.P.    Secretary     is    of   considerable
public importance and needed a resolution.
Accordingly,      the     High       Court    after
dismissing    the   writ   petition     on   merits
went on to answer the aforesaid question
terming the same to be a “larger issue”.
5.       As the opinion of the High Court
holding the said certificate to be invalid
has  the  potential     of   affecting     a  large
number of persons who were not before the
High   Court   a   series     of    Special   Leave
Petitions have been filed by such persons
before    this      Court      challenging      the
aforesaid part of the order of the             High
Court.        Leave   to   file     Special   Leave

                       6
Petitions    has    been     granted     and    the
grievances raised have been heard.
6.       The   Appeal    arising    out    of   the
Special   Leave     Petition     filed    by    the
aggrieved writ petitioner before the High
Court i.e. Monowara Bewa @ Manora Bewa has
also been entertained and heard along with
the above group of appeals.
7.       We have heard the learned counsels
for the parties.
8.       A reading of the order of the High
Court would go to show that according to
the High Court the document in question
was  a  means   to   facilitate     a   claim   for
inclusion  in   the   NRC   by  reference     to  a
document  which    is  post    24th  March,    1971
i.e. cut off date on the basis of which
citizenship    under     Section     6A   of    the

                             7
  Citizenship Act, 1955 is required to be
  determined.      The High Court took the view
  that all the other documents listed in the
  'illustrative           list       of       documents
  admissible' are prior to the cut off date
  and,   therefore,         there    cannot    be   any
  special reason for inclusion of the said
  document      i.e.         contemporaneous       G.P.
  Secretary    certificate       in   the   said  list,
  even as a supporting document.               In this
  regard, the High Court took the view that
  this Court in Sarbananda Sonowal Vs. Union
  of India1 has held that the State of Assam
  is   facing       “external       aggression”     and
  “internal disturbance” on account of huge
  influx of illegal migrants and keeping in
  mind the seriousness of the problem the
  use   of    the     document      in    question   to
  establish citizenship for inclusion in the
  updated NRC cannot commend for acceptance.
1          (2005) 5 SCC 665

                        8
9.       The High Court also took the view
that  under   the   provisions      of   the   Assam
Panchayat    Act,    1994    issuance      of    such
certificate    is   not    contemplated       and/or
authorized.     Referring to the provisions
of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the High
Court was also of the opinion that as the
said certificate is not issued by the G.P.
Secretary   on   the   basis    of   any   official
records,   the    same     is    not   a    'public
document'     and,     in     fact,     the      said
certificate    partakes    the   character      of  a
'private   document'      issued    by    the    G.P.
Secretary.   The   evidentiary      value    of   the
same, therefore, is open to serious doubt.
It is on the aforesaid broad basis that
the  High    Court    thought      it   proper     to
invalidate the certificate in question.
10.      The       invalidation         of        the

                      9
certificate which was an agreed document
in the matter of processing of claims for
inclusion in the updated NRC undoubtedly
has the effect of affecting a large number
of  claimants   who   may  have  filed  their
applications for inclusion in the NRC.
11.     It may therefore be necessary to
very briefly notice the circumstances in
which the illustrative list of documents
including  the    certificate   of  the  G.P.
Secretary appearing at Serial No.13 of the
said list had come into existence.
12.     A     set     of    modalities    for
preparation of the NRC was formulated by
the  State  Government    through  a  Cabinet
sub-committee. The sub-committee which was
initially constituted on 3rd August, 2010
had been reconstituted from time to time.
The   modalities     were   discussed   after

                         10
several     rounds     of    deliberations       with
various   stakeholders      including     All   Assam
Students'    Union     (“AASU”)    and   26   Ethnic
Unions   as   well   as    All   Assam   Minorities
Students'    Union     (“AAMSU”).     The   list    of
documents     were    part    of    the    aforesaid
modalities which after being finalized by
the  State     Government     were    sent   to    the
Government of India on 5th July, 2013. The
approval of the Union Government of the
said   modalities      was   communicated       by   a
letter   dated    22nd   November,    2014   of    the
Union   Home     Secretary     addressed     to    the
Chief    Secretary      of   the    Government      of
Assam. After the aforesaid approval of the
Union      Home      Secretary,        the      State
Coordinator     (NRC)    informed    the   Registrar
General of India of the decision of the
Union   Government     and   sought    instructions
of the said Authority, i.e., R.G.I. with
regard to issuance of such certificates.

                      11
This was communicated by a letter dated 9th
April, 2015 of the State Coordinator. In
response to the said letter, the R.G.I. by
communication dated 5th May, 2015 approved
the  format  of   the   certificate(s)     to  be
issued  by   the    G.P.   Secretary/Executive
Magistrate.      Thereafter,        the     State
Coordinator by a communication issued on
the same day i.e. 5th May, 2015 informed
all the Deputy Commissioners of the States
of  the  decision    of   the  R.G.I.    and  the
approval of the format of the certificates
that are to be issued by a G.P. Secretary
in rural areas and Executive Magistrate in
the   urban    areas     for    married     women
migrating  to   a  new   place   on   account  of
marriage.   The   required    protocol     to  be
followed in issuing such certificates was
also communicated by the said letter of
the Coordinator dated 5th May, 2015.

                       12
13.       From   the   above  it   would   appear
that   the   list  of   illustrative    documents
including    the  G.P.   Secretary   certificate
were agreed to by all stakeholders in the
process   of   updation   of  the   NRC  and  the
same also had the approval of the Union
Government as well as the State Government
pursuant to which instructions were issued
to  the    district   level   officers    in  the
matter of issuance of such certificate in
tune with the required protocol.
14.       The    exercise    in   question    was
undertaken by the High Court to consider
an   issue    not  strictly    arising    in  the
proceedings before it. Resolution of the
issue was not indispensable for         answering
the writ petitions under consideration of
the   High     Court.    The   issue    had   the
potential of affecting the large number of
citizens    who   were   not  before    the  High

                        13
Court. No notice under the provisions of
Order   I   rule   8   of   the    Code   of   Civil
Procedure, 1908 was also issued to enable
the   persons    likely     to    be   affected   to
contest    the   matter    in   a    representative
capacity.     Though, the order of the High
Court insofar as the issue of the validity
of  the     certificate      is    liable    to   be
interdicted on the above basis alone, we
are  of   the  view   that     we   should  proceed
further in the matter and record our views
on   the     issue     of    validity      of    the
certificate     in   question      to   dispel   all
doubts   in   the   matter    and    to  avoid   any
further litigation on the issue.
15.       The certificate issued by the G.P.
Secretary merely acknowledges the shifting
of residence of a married woman from one
village to another. The said certificate
by itself and by no means establishes any

                       14
claim of citizenship of the holder of the
certificate.     This is made clear in the
illustrative list of documents itself by
specifying    the     same    to     be    only   a
supporting document.        The certificate in
question   only     enables     its     holder   to
establish a link between the holder and
the person from whom legacy is claimed.
It  has  been   made    clear   in    the   several
reports of the learned State Coordinator,
NRC,  Assam  that    a   claim   accompanied     by
such a certificate, without details of the
legacy person, is to be discarded and in
the  event  information      as   to   the   legacy
person has been furnished, the certificate
in question is to be used for the limited
purpose of providing a linkage after due
enquiry and verification.
16.      The certificate issued by the G.P.
Secretary,   by    no    means,    is    proof   of

                      15
citizenship.   Such proof will come only if
the  link  between     the   claimant  and  the
legacy person (who has to be a citizen) is
established.     The certificate has to be
verified at two stages.       The first is the
authenticity   of   the   certificate   itself;
and the second is the authenticity of the
contents  thereof.    The   latter  process  of
verification is bound to be an exhaustive
process in the course of which the source
of information of the facts and all other
details recorded in the certificate will
be ascertained after giving an opportunity
to the holder of the certificate.        If the
document   and    its    contents   is   to  be
subjected to a thorough search and probe
we  do not   see   why   the  said  certificate
should have been interdicted by the High
Court, particularly, in the context of the
facts  surrounding      the   enumeration   and
inclusion  of   the   documents   mentioned  in

                         16
the  illustrative       list    of   documents,   as
noticed above. In fact, the said list of
illustrative       documents      was   also    laid
before   this    Court    in  the   course   of  the
proceedings    held     from   time   to  time   and
this  Court    was    aware   of   the  nature   and
effect of each of the documents mentioned
in the list.
17.       The above apart, from a conjoint
reading    of  the    provisions     of  the   Assam
Panchayat    Act,    1994    i.e.   Sections   19(1)
(vi),   21   and   122,    it  would   appear   that
directions        for      issuance      of     such
certificate can come within the ambit of
the jurisdiction of the authorities under
the Act in which event the view taken by
the   High     Court      and    the    contentions
advanced on behalf of the State that the
said   document      is   a   'private    document'
would be legally fragile.

                       17
18.       For all the aforesaid reasons we
set   aside  the   order    of  the   High   Court
insofar     as    the     invalidity     of    the
certificate issued by the G.P. Secretary
is concerned and allow the present appeals
to the above limited extent. We make it
clear that the certificates issued by the
G.P.   Secretary/Executive      Magistrate    will
however be acted upon only to establish a
linkage    between     the    holder    of    such
certificate    and  the    person(s)   from   whom
legacy is being claimed. The certificate
will be put to such limited use only if
the contents of the certificate are found
to   be   established     on   due   and    proper
enquiry and verification.
19.       Civil    Appeal     arising    out    of
Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.12647 of
2017    will   now    be    listed   before    the

                             18
         appropriate Bench for disposal on merits
         so  far as   the order  of  the  High  Court
         holding  the  writ petitioner   –  appellant
         (i.e. Monowara Bewa @ Manora Bewa) to be a
         foreigner is concerned.
