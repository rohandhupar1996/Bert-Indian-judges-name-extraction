                                           BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
14.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Mahammad Ali Sheikh, learned counsel for the petitioners and
    Mr. Nava Kumar Kalita, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam appearing for
    the State opposite party No. 1. Also heard Md. Moinul Hoque Choudhury, learned
    counsel for opposite party No.2, complainant.
             The opposite party No.2 as complainant on 03.05.2016 lodged a criminal
    complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bongaigaon being CR Case No.
    53C/2016 against the petitioners alleging offences under Sections 161/341/323/294
    IPC stating that on 27.04.2016, he filed an application under Right to Information
    Act, 2005 before the Public Information Officer in the Office of the Circle Officer,
    Bongaigaon seeking certain documents. Said complainant stated that as he was
    told to come on the very next day for the documents, he accordingly reported
    before the concerned PIO of the Circle Office, Bongaigaon, but he was not attended
    by the concerned official. As such, he again went to the said office after three days
    of filing the said RTI application and asked the authority to provide him the
    required information. It is stated by the complainant that from the concerned Lat
    Mandal of the Revenue Authority of Bongaigaon, he could come to know that
    documents were already made ready and later the complainant was asked to come
    to the chamber of the Head Assistant of the said office and asked him for an
    amount of Rs.2,000/- and stated that the accused No. 1, the present petitioner told
    him that unless the said amount of Rs.2,000/- is paid, he won’t get the report, to
    which the complainant protested and for which he was misbehaved and was
    abused with foul language. It also alleged by the complainant that when one of
    the witnesses tried to pacify the situation, the accused No. 1/present petitioner
    No.1 hit him with hand.
             On the basis of the said complaint, in CR Case No. 53C/2016 after recording
    the statement of said complainant/opposite party No. 2 under Section 200 Cr.P.C.,
    Crl. Ptn. No. 524 of 2016                                                 Page 1 of 5

learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Bongaigaon by his order dated 11.05.2016,
took cognizance of the offences under Sections 341/323/294 IPC against the
petitioners herein and issued summons to them fixing 30.05.2016 for their
appearance. Since summons in the said CR Case No. 53C/2016 were issued lately,
i.e. only on 16.06.2016, learned magistrate fixed 30.06.2016 as the date of for
appearance of the accused persons of the case, the present petitioners. On
30.06.2016, both the accused persons/petitioners filed appropriate application
through their engaged counsel and prayed for some time for their appearance,
which was accordingly allowed by the learned JMFC, Bongaigaon fixing 29.07.2016
for their appearance.
         On 30.06.2016 itself, the complainant/opposite party No.2 vide petition No.
537/2016 field an application before the Trial Magistrate stating that he had filed
the said criminal complaint being CR Case No. 53C/2016 against the petitioners due
to some misunderstanding and that he does not want to pursue the case further
and as such prayed to terminate the said proceeding. However, the learned JMFC,
Bongaigaon did not consider the said application of the complainant observing that
the same will be considered only after appearance of the accused persons of the
case, i.e. the present petitioners.
         Hence, this criminal petition for quashing the proceeding of said CR Case
No. 53C/2016 pending before the learned JMFC, Bongaigaon.
         It is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the petitioner No.1 on
30.04.2016 lodged an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge, Bongaigaon Police Station
against the said opposite party No. 2 stating that on 27.04.2016 he filed an
application under the RTI seeking certain information and though the opposite
party No. 2 was informed that such information that he had sought for will be
delivered in the next week, said opposite party No.2 abused him with filthy
language in the office itself and when he objected to it, he was beaten up by the
said complainant and the other personnel of the office, present in the office,
rescued him from the said situation and when persons present in the office tried to
apprehend the said opposite party No.2, he fled away from the said place of
occurrence. The said FIR of the petitioner No.1 dated 30.04.2016 was duly
Crl. Ptn. No. 524 of 2016                                               Page 2 of 5

registered as Bongaigaon P.S. Case No. 244/2016 under Sections 448/294/323/506
IPC (corresponding to GR No. 365/2016).
         According to the petitioners, the Trial Magistrate did not consider the
offence alleged in the criminal complaint pertaining to said CR Case No. 53C/2016
as well as the entire alleged incident in proper perspective that allegedly occurred
during discharge of the official duty by the petitioners. Therefore, the petitioners
submitted that the learned JMFC, Bongaigaon, while taking cognizance of the
offences under Sections 341/323/294 IPC, by the impugned order dated
11.05.2016 passed in said CR Case No. 53C/2016 committed illegality as the
cognizance of the offences against the petitioners were taken by the said Trial
magistrate without obtaining any prior sanction as required under Section 197
Cr.P.C. and issued summons against them.
         It is also placed on behalf of the petitioners that the complainant himself on
30.06.2016 by filing an application in said CR Case No. 53C/2016 before the learned
JMFC, Bongaigaon, submitted that he does not want to pursue his said complaint
case against the petitioners that was filed by him due to certain misunderstanding
and that the said Trial Magistrate did not consider the same but insisted for
appearance of the petitioners/accused in said CR Case No. 53C/2016 on 29.07.2016
as reflected from the impugned order dated 30.06.2016.
         Mr. MH Choudhury, learned counsel on behalf of the opposite party No.2/
the complainant categorically submitted that as the matter has been settled outside
the court to their satisfaction and the disputes between them had been
compromised mutually, said complainant does not want to pursue the proceeding
pertaining to said CR Case No. 53C/2016 against the petitioners/accused persons in
the said CR Case.
         The allegations against the petitioners raised by the complainant/opposite
party No.2 as seen from his complaint filed on 03.05.2016, it can be seen that the
alleged incident occurred on 30.04.2016 while the petitioners/accused persons
were discharging their official duty and the learned JMFC, Bongaigaon, the Trial
Magistrate, without obtaining any prior sanction, as required under Section 197
Cr.P.C., more particularly in a private complainant, by his order dated 11.05.2016,
Crl. Ptn. No. 524 of 2016                                                  Page 3 of 5

took cognizance of the offences under Sections 341/323/294 IPC. It is seen that
the complainant/opposite party No. 2 by his application dated 30.06.2016
specifically submitted before the said Trial Magistrate that he filed the said
complaint due to misunderstanding and does not want to pursue the same further
and, as such, prayed to terminate/close the proceeding of said CR Case No. 53C/
2016 and in spite of that, the learned Trial Magistrate, the JMFC, Bongaigaon by his
order dated 30.06.2016, observed that such prayer of the complainant shall be
considered only after appearance of the accused persons/the petitioners herein.
         In the present case, the allegations of the offences under Sections
341/323/294 IPC are private in nature and further, except Section 294 IPC,
Sections 341 and 323 IPC are compoundable in nature, subject to the approval of
the court. The Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh -Vs- State of Punjab &
Another, reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303, have held that irrespective of the fact that
such offences have not been made compoundable, the High Court may within the
framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal
complaint or FIR, if it is satisfied that there is any likelihood of offender being
convicted, if such offences are private in nature and does not have serious impact
on the society, where the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak due to the
fact that the witnesses/victim may not turn up to provide evidence against the
offender due to any such settlement between them.
         Apparently, in the present case, no sanction was obtained under Section
197 Cr.P.C. and further the complainant/opposite party No. 2 does not want to
pursue his complaint case being CR Case No. 53C/2016 against the petitioners
because of mutual settlement between them and in that background, where the
alleged offences under Sections 341/323/294 IPC being private in nature, the Court
is of the opinion that if the proceeding of the said complaint case being CR Case
No. 53C/2016 is allowed to continue against the present petitioners, it would be an
abuse of the process of the court.
         As such, for the ends of justice, the proceeding of said complaint case being
CR Case No. 53C/2016, that was filed by the opposite party No. 2 as complainant
on 03.05.2016, presently pending before the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
Crl. Ptn. No. 524 of 2016                                                  Page 4 of 5

Bongaigaon, including the said complaint dated 03.05.2016 of the complainant/
opposite party No. 2 in said CR Case No. 53C/2016 is set aside and quashed.
         In the result, this criminal petition is allowed.
         The interim order passed earlier on 18.07.2016 stands merged with this
order.
                                                                 JUDGE
