    Crl. Rvsn. Ptn. No. 126 of 2015                                             Page 1 of 5

4.       The informant Sonali Roy, daughter of Aswani Roy of Village- Balagram,

who had died in an accident involving night super bus No. AS-01-G/4157 on
28.06.2001 at Suradi Bridge under Barama Police Station, Assam at National
Highway No.31. Ms. Sonali Roy had submitted that due to her ignorance, she
could not file any case before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in time, but
subsequently she came to know that for the same incident a MACT case being No.
1658/2002 had been filed by someone in her name and the claim was settled with
Oriental Insurance Company Limited, Guwahati on 28.02.2003 for Rs. 1,80,000/-
where payment was released vide Cheque Nos. 646612 dated 13.05.2003 for Rs.
1,40,000/- and Cheque No. 646613 dated 13.05.2003 for Rs.40,000/- issued on
Indian Overseas Bank, Panbazar, Guwahati, in the name of Sonali Roy, which had
been received by someone else impersonating as Sonali Roy.
5.       After the investigation that was made by the CBI, it was disclosed that Md.
Mukutar Rahman, Smti Latika Deka, (sole respondent herein), Shri Narendra
Narayan Deka (advocate), Km. Nurunesha Begum and Sri Ashok Kumar
Bhattacharjee entered into a criminal conspiracy and in furtherance to the said
conspiracy fraudulently and dishonestly filed a false Motor Accident Compensation
claim vide Case No. 1658/2002 on 16.09.2002 at the MACT, Kamrup, Guwahati
wherein said Smti Latika Deka impersonating as Ms. Sonali Roy claimed the
compensation amount of Rs. 4,50,000/- and she falsely claimed that Smti Ashwani
Barman, wife of late Shyam Roy died in road accident while travelling by bus No.
AS-01-G/4157. The accused Narendra Narayan Deka, falsely identified Smti Latika
Deka to be Ms. Sonali Roy before the MACT, Kamrup, Guwahati and said Latika
Deka falsely stated under oath before the learned Member MACT, Kamrup on
10.10.2002 that while returning from Dhubri by bus to Guwahati along with her
mother they met an accident at Barama and that her mother succumbed to
injuries. The other accused Shri Ashok Kumar Bhattacharjee, now expired, who
was the investigator of the Company submitted a false report on 10.2.2003 along
Crl. Rvsn. Ptn. No. 126 of 2015                                           Page 2 of 5

with a photograph of Smti Latika Deka purporting it to be that of Sonali Roy, on
the basis of which the Oriental Insurance Company Limited agreed and settled the
claim for an amount of Rs. 1,80,000/- in a conciliation settlement on 28.02.2003.
The said compensation amount of Rs. 1,80,000/- was awarded and disbursed by
the MACT, Kamrup vide two numbers of State Bank of India, Account payee
cheques bearing one Cheque Nos. 646612 dated 13.05.2003 for Rs.1,40,000/- and
No. 646613 dated 13.05.2003 for Rs. 40,000/- issued on Indian Overseas Bank,
Panbazar, Guwahati one in favour of Sonali Roy and other cheque in favour of the
Branch Manager, Indian Overseas Bank, Panbazar, Guwahati and that those two
numbers of cheques were received by the accused Latika Deka impersonating and
forging the signature of Ms. Sonali Roy on the money receipt dated 13.5.2003
given to the MACT, Kamrup. Said Latika Deka impersonating as Sonali Roy opened
an account in the Indian Overseas Bank, Panbazar and said accused Narendra
Narayan Deka, Advocate, dishonestly introduced said Latika Deka as Ms. Sonali
Roy, while opening the said account in the Bank and said Latikia Deka deposited
the cheque of Rs. 1,40,000/- in the said account and Ms. Deka by withdrawal slips
dated 19.05.2003 and 20.05.2003 had withdrawn Rs. 1,35,000/- and Rs. 4,500/-
respectively impersonating as Ms. Sonali Roy.
6.       The petitioner submits that the learned Trial Magistrate committed illegality
in passing the impugned order dated 23.8.2013 when the charges under Section
120B/419/420/467/471 IPC are yet to be proved in the prosecution evidence and,
as such, the learned Trial Court should not have considered the prayer made by
the accused respondent under Section 306 Cr.P.C. where there is specific
allegation that the said accused entered into criminal conspiracy with other
accused and fraudulently and dishonestly filed said MACT No.1658 of 2002 on
16.09.2002 before the MACT, Kamrup, claiming Rs. 4,50,000/- and that making
the said accused a prosecution witness and to lead pivotal evidence and prove
would set the entire prosecution case into inescapable motion.
7.       The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Suresh Chandra Bahri -Vs- State
of Bihar, reported in 1995 (Suppl) (1) SCC 80, have held that “the Magistrate
tendering pardon has to maintain a record stating – (i) the reason for his
tendering pardon; and (ii) whether or not the same was accepted. It is held by the
Crl. Rvsn. Ptn. No. 126 of 2015                                          Page 3 of 5

Hon’ble Supreme Court that ordinarily it is for the prosecution to ask for pardon a
particular accused, out of several, may be tendered pardon (AIR 1968 SC 594).
But, even where the accused directly applies to the special judges, the said
accused must first refer the request to the prosecuting agency and unless the
prosecution joins in the request of the accused with objectivity, the Court would
not grant pardon to the accomplish. As provided under Sub-Section (3)(a) of
Section 306 Cr.P.C., it is the duty of the Magistrate to record the reasons while
granting pardon to an accused and, if no reasons are recorded, the whole order of
the magistrate can be quashed.”
8.       The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of P.C. Mishra -Vs- State (CBI),
reported in (2014) 14 SCC 629, have held that “the power to grant pardon enjoins
under Section 306 Cr.P.C. is a substantial power and the reason for tendering
pardon must be recorded and the same can be granted only when it is necessary
in the interest of successful prosecution of other offenders or else the conviction
of those offenders would not be easy.”
9.       In the present case, it is seen from the impugned order dated 23.08.2003
passed by the learned Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam that while accepting the
tender of pardon and directing the said accused – the sole respondent herein, to
examine herself as prosecution witness, did not state any such reason for granting
her pardon except stating that her pardon is accepted on condition of her making
a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within her knowledge relating
to the offence and to every other person concerned, whether principal or in the
commission thereof.
10.      Finding the impugned order dated 23.8.2013, passed by the Special
Judicial Magistrate, CBI, Assam, at Guwahati in Case No. 4403 of 2007 accepting
the application under section 306 Cr.P.C. of the accused Latika Deka, the sole
respondent herein, granting her pardon and directing to examine her as
prosecution witness, being not in conformity with the provisions of Section 306
Cr.P.C. and the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, as noted above, the
said order is hereby set aside and quashed.
11.      This revision petition is accordingly allowed.

Judicial Magistrate, CBI, Assam, at Guwahati as well as to the office of the Chief
