                           IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
(THE HIGH COURT OF ASSAM : NAGALAND : MIZORAM & ARUNACHAL PRADESH)
                                    WP(C) 5796/2010
                  Sri Monoj Shah
                                                                            ……..Petitioner
                          - VER SUS -
                  The State of Assam & Ors.,
                                                                            ………Respondents
                                               BEFORE
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ACHINTYA MALLA BUJOR BARUA
          Advocate for the petitioner       :-None appears.
          Advocate for the respondent No.3:- Mr. S. Bora
          Advocate for the state respondent:- Mr. G. Pegu
          Date of Hearing & Judgment          : 03.08.2017
                                  JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
          None appears for the petitioner, when the matter is called upon. Heard Mr. G. Pegu,
 learned state counsel appears for the state respondents as well as Mr. S. Bora, learned counsel
 for the respondent No.3.
 2.       This being a matter pending since the year 2010, where no steps have been taken by the
 petitioner to get the matter listed after 15.12.2010, this Court deems it appropriate that keeping
 the matter pending further is no longer justifiable. It is more so, in view of the fact that this writ
 petition is against the eviction notice dated 08.06.2010 of the respondent authorities of the
 Deputy Commissioner Kamrup(M) in Eviction Case No.25/2010. It is noticed that the writ petition
 was filed on 12.10.2010, wherein an interim order dated 12.10.2010 was passed by this Court at
 the time of issuing notice, whereby, it was provided that till the returnable date, the petitioner
                                                                            Page 1 of 3

was not be evicted from land which forms the subject matter of eviction case No.25/2010,
pursuant to the eviction notice dated 08.06.2010.
3.       On 12.11.2010, when the matter was listed, learned state counsel had made a
submission that pursuant to the eviction notice on 08.06.2010, the petitioner had already evicted
from the concerned land. However, as the same was a mere submission, this Court had provided
that for a fair adjudication, the state respondents shall file affidavit on the basis thereof and
accordingly, continued the interim order till the next date fixed and fixed the matter on
15.12.2010. On 15.12.2010, learned counsel for the petitioner had made a prayer that the mater
be again listed in the next week, but what is noticeable is that the interim order was not
continued any further. The state respondents through the Additional Deputy Commissioner,
Kamrup(M) filed an affidavit-in-opposition on 19.01.2011, wherein, in paragraph-4, it has been
averred that the land covered by Dag No.1182 (Pt) of Sahar Ulubari, Part-II under Ulubar Mouza
is a government land and it is reserved for a cremation ground.
4.       In paragraph-8, it is stated that the land in question is a sarkari land and the government
has all the right to clear encroachment of such land and in doing so all the necessary formalities
had been observed.
5.       In paragraph-10 it has been reiterated that the land is reserved for cremation ground. It
has further been specifically stated that the eviction had been carried out by following all the
formalities required on 18.06.2010.       No reply has been filed by the petitioner against the
affidavit-in-opposition. It is noticeable that the eviction notice is dated 08.06.2010 and the
required eviction had already been carried out on 18.06.2010. On the other hand, the petitioner
had approached this Court in October, 2010, and the interim order dated 12.10.2010 was
obtained subsequent to the eviction being carried out.
6.       In such view of the matter, as the eviction notice dated 08.06.2010 had already been
carried out and executed, no further adjudication is required to examine the validity of the said
eviction notice. Subsequently, the petitioner filed an additional affidavit, wherein, another notice
dated 23.03.2012 had been annexed in respect of the same land, which has been issued
pursuant to Encroachment Case No.16/2012. By bringing on record, the said notice dated
                                                                              Page 2 of 3

23.03.2012 in Encroachment Case No.16/2012, the petitioner seeks to make out a case that the
said notice be also set aside. It is not understood as to under what circumstance the subsequent
notice 23.03.2012 had been issued by the Addl. Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup(M). More so, the
same Addl. Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup(M) had earlier filed affidavit-in-opposition dated
19.11.2011 wherein, specifically it has been stated that the petitioner had already been evicted
on 18.06.2010, pursuant to the earlier notice dated 08.06.2010.
7.       In any view of the matter, if the petitioner is aggrieved by any subsequent notice in
Encroachment Case No.16/2012, the petitioner is at liberty to approach any appropriate forum as
may be advised against such notice and the validity of the same cannot be examined in the
absence of any such challenge to the said notice in an appropriate forum, in a situation where
the notice had merely been brought on record by filing an additional affidavit in an existing writ
proceeding against some earlier notice. Accordingly, if so advised, and also if aggrieved, the
petitioner is granted liberty to proceed against the subsequent notice dated 23.03.2012. But
against the earlier notice dated 08.06.2010, which had already been executed on 18.06.2010,
this Court does not find any reason to further proceed to determine the validity of the said notice
of 08.06.2010.
          In view of the above, this petition stands closed.
         Interim order passed earlier stands vacated.
                                                                                           JUDGE
