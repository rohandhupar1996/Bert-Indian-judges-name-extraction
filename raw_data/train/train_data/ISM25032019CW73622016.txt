       %                      25.03.2019
Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
1. In all these petitions, the facts more or less are similar and the reliefs
sought are almost identical. They are accordingly being disposed of by this
common order. Nevertheless, each of the petitions was heard separately.
   W.P. (C) 7362 of 2016 and batch                                    Page 4 of 10

2. In each of these petitions, the main relief sought is for a declaration of
deemed lapsing of the land acquisition proceedings under Section 24 (2) of
the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 („the 2013 Act‟). The declaration
is sought in respect of land situated in the Revenue Estate of Village
Barwala in Delhi. The acquisition is by means of notification dated 21 st
March 2003 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
(LAA) followed by a declaration dated 19th March 2004 under Section 6
LAA and an Award No. 12/2005-06 dated 5th August 2005. The public
purpose of the acquisition was for the Rohini Residential Scheme. The only
difference in the petitions is as regards the khasra Nos. and the extent of
land.
3. Two facts are admitted by the Petitioners in these petitions. One is that
each of them has received compensation in terms of the land acquisition
Award. Second, that the same land acquisition proceedings in respect of
lands in the Revenue Estate of Village Barwala, were challenged in an
earlier round of litigation by way of a batch of writ petitions where the lead
matter was W.P. (C) 2501/2013 (Naresh Kumar & Ors. v. Union of India),
By a detailed judgment dated 17th April 2013, a Division Bench (DB) of this
Court dismissed the writ petition inter alia holding as under:
      “We, at the inception, put to learned senior counsel for the
      petitioners as to why and how can we permit a settled position to
      be unsettled after a decade. This is so as the petitioners chose to
      remain silent when the acquisition proceedings were initiated,
      accepted the same, took compensation and sought references for
   W.P. (C) 7362 of 2016 and batch                                   Page 5 of 10

 enhancement of compensation. The aforesaid facts have to be
 examined in the conspectus of the purpose for which the land
 was acquired which was planned development of Rohini
 Residential Scheme. In Delhi there has been large scale
 acquisition by the DDA which was originally the only authority
 which was engaged in development of land and meeting the
 housing needs of the people. No doubt in this process while large
 tracts of land were acquired, some land remain undeveloped and
 the DDA could not protect its land pool with the result
 encroachment took place. These encroachments have been on
 such a massive scale with practically no prevention that a large
 part of habitants of Delhi reside in these colonies. The
 Government has come up now with schemes of regularization of
 these colonies.
 Rohini Residential Scheme like other schemes is in the nature of
 a mini township. Such a mini township will contain all the
 essential features, i.e. residential areas, commercial areas,
 institutional areas. Thus, while there will be development of
 residential plots, there would also be development of commercial
 areas to take care of the needs of residents. These may be
 shopping arcades or there may be hotel sites, etc. Similarly there
 would be institutional requirements like for purpose of schools,
 hospitals, community facilities, etc. If land is allotted for all these
 purposes it cannot be said that the purpose of acquisition has
 disappeared or there is mala fide exercise of the power of
 acquisition. The DDA would spend large amount of monies on
 development of the area and, thus, to have a transparency auction
 is often the method, adopted for allotment, at least, with
 commercial areas while in case of residential areas there may be
 auction of plots or particular schemes under which plots and flats
 are allotted. It may be possible even to allot land to certain
 societies for their needs. Similarly hotel sites and commercial
 buildings are often auctioned.
 We are, thus, of the view that the nature of allegations made in
 this writ petition cannot be said of such a nature as to suggest that
 there is a mala fide exercise of power or improper use of the land,
W.P. (C) 7362 of 2016 and batch                                     Page 6 of 10

     which has been acquired.
     ………
     We are of the view that the petitioners cannot after such a long
     period seek to rake up the issue of acquisition merely on the basis
     of some recent pronouncements by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
     even when they accepted the compensation qua acquisition of the
     land by neither challenging the acquisition proceedings nor the
     award but on the other hand were only interested in enhancement
     of compensation for which they have sought a reference. They
     have also recovered the compensation and for them now to say
     that they are willing to return that compensation after number of
     years and should be permitted to assail the acquisition
     proceedings would not, in our view, be the appropriate direction
     to be passed.
     In view of these facts and circumstances, we are not inclined to
     entertain the petition seeking to challenge the acquisition
     proceedings both on grounds of delay and laches as also on
     account of the acquiescence and conduct of the petitioners qua
     the acquisition proceedings.
     Dismissed.”
4. On 3rd February 2015 the Supreme Court of India passed the following
orders in SLP (C) No. 17121/2013 (Naresh Kumar v. Union of India) and a
batch of special leave petitions (SLPs), all of which were directed against the
above order dated 17th April 2013 of the DB of this Court in W.P. (C)
2501/2013 and batch. The order reads as under:
       “SLP (C) Nos. 17121, 33188 of 2013 & SLP (C) 17482, 13358
       of 2014
       Shri T. N. Singh and Dr. Surat Singh, learned counsels for the
       Petitioners in respective matters on instructions, seek
       permission of this Court to withdraw these petitions.
       Permission sought is granted.
   W.P. (C) 7362 of 2016 and batch                                  Page 7 of 10

       The special leave petitions are disposed of as withdrawn.
       Contempt Petition (S) No. 319 of 2013 in SLP (C) 17121 of 2013
       In view of the withdrawal of the special leave petition, nothing
       survives for consideration and decision in this contempt
       petition. The contempt petition is dismissed in terms of the
       signed order.”
5. Thus no liberty was granted to the Petitioners in the above matters to
challenge the land acquisition proceedings afresh. The order dated 17 th April
2013 passed by the DB of this Court in Naresh Kumar (supra) rejecting the
challenge to the land acquisition proceedings qua the lands in village
Barwala for the Rohini Residential Scheme attained finality.
6. Mr. S. K. Rout, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners while not
disputing the above two facts, bases his claim for the relief of deemed
lapsing under Section 24 (2) of the 2013 Act on the ground that possession
of the lands in question still remains with the Petitioners. He questioned the
stand of the LAC as well as the DDA in their respective counter affidavits
that actual physical possession of the land in question has been taken from
the Petitioners.
7. In this context, a reference needs to be made to the orders passed by the
Supreme Court on 10th March 2015, 28th January 2016 and 18th October
2016 in SLP (C) Nos. 16385-88/2012 (Rahul Gupta v. Delhi Development
Authority) and in the interlocutory applications („I.As‟) in the said SLPs.
Although, in the order dated 10th March 2015, the Supreme Court referred to
the acquisition of land for the Rohini Residential Scheme in Sectors 34, 35,
   W.P. (C) 7362 of 2016 and batch                                  Page 8 of 10

36 and 37, in the subsequent order dated 18th October 2016, it was made
clear that the effect of the said order of the Supreme Court was to be applied
to all the lands acquired for the Rohini Residential Scheme. In the order
dated 18th October 2016 while disposing of various I.As in the
aforementioned SLPs, the Supreme Court directed as under:
      “Heard Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
      applicants and perused the interlocutory applications.
      In view of the order dated 10.03.2015, passed by this Court in
      SLP (C) Nos. 16385-16388 of 2012, and a subsequent order
      dated 28.01.2016, passed in the same special leave petitions, the
      interim order passed by the High Court of Delhi on 04.3.2015 in
      W.P.(C) No. 1915/2015 (Annexure A-4 in the instant
      interlocutory applications), is liable to be vacated, and is
      accordingly vacated.
      We grant liberty to the Delhi Development Authority to produce
      a copy of this order in all matters, pertaining to land
      acquisition relating to the Rohini Residential Scheme,
      pending before the High Court, for vacation of similar interim
      directions.
      It is made clear that in case the applicants have re-entered
      possession or otherwise, they shall vacate the said land and hand
      over its possession forthwith to the Delhi Development
      Authority, failing which it shall be assumed to be in possession
      of the Delhi Development Authority, after the expiry of ten days
      from the passing of the instant order.
      With the aforesaid directions, these interlocutory applications
      stand disposed of.” (emphasis supplied)
8. These directions were repeated in the remaining I.As which were disposed
of on the same date i.e. 18th October 2016. In effect therefore, the position is
that if anyone still in possession of lands acquired for the Rohini Residential

Scheme had not surrendered possession thereof to the DDA within ten days
of the order dated 18th October 2016, then the possession thereof was
deemed to be with the DDA. It would no longer be open to such persons to
contend that actual physical possession of the lands in question remains with
them.
9. This legal position has been clarified by this Court in its order dated 22nd
November 2018 in W.P. (C) 51118/2016 (Jawahar Singh v. Lt. Governor)
and reiterated in the order dated 25th January 2019 in W.P. (C) 3438/2015
(Krishna Devi v. Union of India).
10. Thus with neither of the two essential ingredients of Section 24 (2) of
2013 Act viz., retention of actual physical possession or non-tendering of
compensation, being satisfied in the instant case, the reliefs sought cannot be
granted.
11. The petitions are accordingly dismissed.
