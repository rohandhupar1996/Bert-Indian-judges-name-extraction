RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.
1.      W.P.(C) 537/2010 & W.P.(C) 5886/2010 seek mandamus for
payment of the compensation for acquisition of land under the Special
Rehabilitation Package (SRP) announced by the Land & Building Deptt.
of the Govt. of NCT of Delhi on 1st October, 2008. Though in W.P.(C)
Nos.6984 to 6992 all of 2011, besides the said relief, a relief for payment
of the award amount was also claimed but the counsel for the petitioners
state that the same has been since received and now does not survive;
however the said writ petitioners also seek direction for payment of
interest @ 18% per annum on the award amount from the date the said
amount was deposited by the DDA with the office of the respondent Land
Acquisition Collector (LAC) and till the date of its disbursement.
2.      I will first take up the aspect of claim for interest.
3.      Though at first blush, it appeared that the claim for interest should
have been a subject matter of reference under Section 18 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 but the counsel for the petitioners has contended
that Section 18 envisages disputes as to compensation till the making of
the award in as much as the reference has to be sought within 42 days
from the date of service of notice of making of the award. It is contended
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                              Page 3 of 10

that the claim for interest made in the writ petitions is for the reason of
the delay in making the payment after the award and particularly when
DDA, for whose benefit land was acquired, had deposited the awarded
amount with the LAC. It is thus stated that the claim for post award
interest cannot be subject matter of reference under Section 18 of the Act.
The senior counsel for the respondent LAC also does not controvert the
said position.
4.      The counsel for the petitioners has contended that under Section
23(1A) of the Act, interest on the compensation as per market rate from
the date of Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act till the date of
award or of taking possession, whichever is earlier is provided; that the
purport was to compensate the owner of the land for the delays; that the
Act does not provide for any interest for the period of delay between date
of making of award and taking over of the possession. It is stated that in
the present case the award was made on 16th February, 2009, the
compensation amount was deposited by the respondent DDA with the
respondent LAC in November, 2009 but possession taken only in June,
2011 and in pursuance to the order in W.P.(C)5886/2010 and the award
amount disbursed only in August, 2011. It is contended that the
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                            Page 4 of 10

respondent LAC cannot be permitted to enjoy the amounts deposited by
the respondent DDA and is liable to pay interest thereon as claimed.
5.      On enquiry from the counsel for the petitioners as to why the
petitioners should be held entitled to interest for the said delay even if any
since the petitioners continued to enjoy the benefits and possession of the
land, the counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioners could not
fully enjoy the land even though continued in possession thereof since
under threat of acquisition they could not be expected to make any
improvements etc. on the land and thus could not fully beneficially enjoy
the land. On further enquiry, as to what improvements could have been
made, the land being agricultural, the counsel states that the irrigation
facilities for better yield from the land could have been improved and
improvement whereof was not made owing to the sword of acquisition
hanging over their head.
6.      On further enquiry from the counsel for the petitioners, that
acquisition being in the nature of compulsory exaction of land, as to how
in the absence of any statutory provision the claim for interest can be
made, the counsel for the petitioners refers to Ram Chand v. Union of
India (1994) 1 SCC 44 (para 22 & 26) to contend that interest beyond
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                               Page 5 of 10

what is provided in the Act can also be awarded.
7.       Per contra, the senior counsel for the respondent LAC has
contended that the matter is squarely covered by the judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court in Udey Singh v. Union of India 112 (2004)
DLT 739 where it has been held that in the absence of any provision in
the Act for payment of interest from the date of award, if no possession is
taken, the Courts cannot fill up the gap and have no option but to reject
the claim for payment of interest for the said period. He also contends
that the interpretation by the counsel for the petitioners of the judgment in
Ram Chand (supra) is erroneous and the Supreme Court has not laid
down any such proposition as is contended. It is further contended, that
the Supreme Court in Ram Chand had only directed payment of
additional amount; that Ram Chand pertains to the pre 1984 amendment
period and therefore in any case would not be applicable to the position
as prevailing now.
8.      The counsel for the petitioners in rejoinder contends that binding
judgment of the Apex Court in Ram Chand was not noticed by the
Division Bench in Udey Singh (supra) and the judgment in Udey Singh is
thus per incuriam. He has also contended that the Division Bench did not
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                               Page 6 of 10

consider the devaluation of the rupee and the entitlement of the land
owner whose land has been compulsorily acquired to compensation of the
value as on the date of the Notification.
9.      Having perused the judgment of the Division Bench in Udey
Singh, I am of the view that the same completely covers the claim made
by the petitioners for interest for the period between the date of the award
and the date of taking over of the possession and it is not for this Bench to
form a different opinion. If according to the counsel for the petitioners,
any relevant arguments remained to be considered in Udey Singh, the
same have to be raised before the Division Bench only and not before this
Bench. Thus the claim for interest made in W.P.(C) Nos. 6984-6992 all of
2011 cannot be entertained and is dismissed.
10.     As far as the claim for SRP is concerned, the respondents in
W.P.(C) 537/2010 & W.P.(C) 5886/2010 have been repeatedly given
time for taking instructions with respect thereto. The senior counsel for
the respondent LAC today also states that since a dispute had arisen as to
the solatium and interest on the SRP, the same has been referred to the
Cabinet of the Delhi Government for decision and only thereafter
payment can be released.
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                              Page 7 of 10

11.     It is further contended that in terms of the order dated 1 st October,
2008 announcing the SRP, the land owners desirous of availing of the
same were required to make an application therefor. It is contended that
without making any such application, the land owners cannot be held to
be entitled to seek any relief for grant of such SRP.
12.     Per contra, the counsel for the petitioners controverts that there was
any such requirement. It is contended that the petitioners have not sought
reference under Section 18 of the Act within the prescribed time in the
light of the said SRP, and as per Clause 7 of the order dated 1st October,
2008 which is as under:-
                “7.    The Special Rehabilitation Package should be
                       accepted by individual farmers and made
                       applicable in each case only, if they do not
                       mount a challenge to the award already
                       announced by the LAC. If they have challenged
                       the award they must withdraw the petition to
                       avail of the benefit of the Special Rehabilitation
                       Package.”
        are required to make        statement only at the time of receiving
payment under the SRP.
13.     The order dated 1st October, 2008 does not provide for any
application as contended to be made; rather Clause 7 aforesaid indicates
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                                Page 8 of 10

that even those who may have challenged the award are entitled to avail
of the SRP upon withdrawing the challenge earlier made by them.
Moreover in view of the categorical statement of the counsel for the
petitioners that none of the petitioners have challenged the award, the
delay in implementation of the SRP is inexplicable.
14.     Need is not felt to keep the petitions pending on this aspect. The
only relief possible is to direct the respondents to offer the payments
under the SRP in a time bound fashion. The petitions in so far as claiming
the relief of mandamus directing the respondents to make payment of the
SRP announced on 1st October, 2008 is concerned, are disposed of with a
direction to the respondent LAC to offer payment under the SRP
announced on 1st October, 2008 on or before 1st December, 2011.
15.     The senior counsel for the respondent LAC has contended that the
payment should be directed as per the decision to be taken by the Cabinet.
It is further contended that the Cabinet is to take a decision as to whether
the SRP is to contain the elements of solatium and interest which in terms
of the order dated 1st October, 2008 were to be as per Rules.
16.     The counsel for the petitioners contends that the SRP announced
and on the basis whereof the petitioners have not sought reference, having
W.P.(C) No.537/2010                                             Page 9 of 10

mentioned that the elements of award namely solatium and interest would
be allowed as per Rules, the Cabinet cannot now change the decision. The
counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) 537/2010 further contends that the
respondent LAC had appeared in person before the Court on 18 th April,
2011 and had assured that the compensation will be released on or before
16th May, 2011. It is further stated that only relief in the said writ petition
was of compensation under the SRP.
17.     This Court today can issue the direction only in terms of order
dated 1st October, 2008 before this Court. If the said order is re-
called/reviewed, the parties will have appropriate remedies with respect
thereto.
18.     The petitions are accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs.
