INDERMEET KAUR, J.
1.    This appeal has impugned the judgment and decree dated
14.22007 which had reserved the finding of the trial judge dated
28.4.2005 whereby the suit filed by the plaintiff Om Prakash
seeking recovery of money had been decreed for a sum of
Rs.41,680.68 along with interest at 9% per annum.        Impugned
judgment had reversed this finding.      Suit of the plaintiff stood

dismissed.
2.    Plaintiff is the proprietor of M/s Pawan Iron & Steel Store;
he had supplied steel pipes to the defendant.                 Payments were
being made by the defendant. A running account was maintained.
It had been agreed that the defendant would make payment
against each bill within seven days from the receipt of the goods
otherwise interest would be chargeable at the rate of 24 % per
month. Despite demands this amount was not paid. Suit was filed
claiming a sum of Rs.41,680.68 for which Rs.36561.88 comprised
of the principal and the balance was the                interest @ 24% per
annum w.e.f. 01.5.1999 to 30.11.1999; interest quotient was
Rs.5119/-.
3.    Defendant contested the suit.               It was denied that any
amount of payable by the defendant much less than the interest
amount.
4.    From the pleadings of the parties the following four issues
were framed:
      “1.Wheher the suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable in the
      present form? OPD
      2.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree of amount claimed
      in the suit? OPP
      3.Whether the plaintiff is entitled to any interest on the amount so
      claimed and if yes at what rate and for what period? OPP
      4.Relief.”
RSA No.243/2007                                                      Page 2 of 7

5.     Oral and documentary evidence was led. The invoices/bills
were proved as Ex.PW-1/1 to Ex.PW-1/18; statement of account
was proved as Ex.PW-1/23. The trial judge on the basis of the oral
and documentary evidence held that the plaintiff is entitled to the
decree of the aforenoted amount. Suit was accordingly decreed.
6.     Impugned judgment had reserved this finding.                  The first
appellate court had held that the statement of account was by
itself was not sufficient to establish the claim of the plaintiff; no
sales tax receipt, balance sheet, ledger book or account books
have been proved by the plaintiff; the extraction from the account
books does not fulfill the requirement of law. Section 34 of the
Evidence Act had been adverted to.               It was noted that the
document         Ex.PW-1/20 to Ex.PW-1/23 are loose sheets of paper
and do not fall within the definition of books of account. Suit of
the plaintiff was accordingly dismissed.
7.     This is a second appeal.         It has been admitted and on
03.8.2010     the    following   substantial     question      of   law     was
formulated:
             “Whether the first Appellate court has illegally ignored the
             documentary evidence adduced by the plaintiff, if so, its
             effect? “
RSA No.243/2007                                                      Page 3 of 7

8.     On behalf of the appellant, it has been urged that the
judgment of the trial court is illegal and perverse; it had not
appreciated the fact that the original record of the Ex.PW-1/1 to
Ex.PW-1/18 and Ex.PW-1/23 had been brought to the Court and
this is evident from the testimony of PW-1. A notice (Ex.PW-1/20)
under Order 12 Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure had also
been issued to the defendant asking him to produce the original
documents but no reply had been furnished to the said notice.
Attention has been drawn to the testimony of DW-1 wherein in his
cross-examination he had admitted that he had given a reply to
Ex.PW-1/20 but the same is not on record.      It is pointed out that
the impugned judgment dismissing the suit of the plaintiff is an
illegality; it is liable to be set aside.
9.     Arguments have been countered. It is pointed out that the
findings of fact have been correctly appreciated by the court
below and the impugned judgment calls for no interference.
10.    Perusal of the record shows that the suit had been dismissed
primarily on two counts. The impugned judgment had noted that
Ex.PW-1/23 which is the statement of account are mere loose
sheets of paper and under Section 34 of the Indian Evidence Act
entries on the books of account unless properly proved cannot be
a piece of evidence. It was noted that these entries in the books
RSA No.243/2007                                             Page 4 of 7

of account were not regularly kept in the course of the business of
the plaintiff.  This finding suffers from a perversity.  PW-1 had
stepped into the witness box and in his affidavit by way of
evidence (Ex.P) he had proved Ex.PW-1/23. He had deposed that
the parties were maintaining a running account and the statement
of account maintained by the plaintiff regularly in the ordinary
course of business which is correct in terms of the cash book and
ledger of the company is Ex.PW-1/23. He had brought the original
ledger and cash book and this is evident from his testimony dated
21.9.2004; the original invoices had also been brought on that
date. Trial judge had noted that the invoices Ex.PW-1/1 to Ex.PW-
1/18 are only photocopies of the carbon copies maintained by the
plaintiff; originals have not been produced.      The case of the
plaintiff is that the originals of these documents were lying with
the defendant and notice under Order 12 Rule 8 of the Code
(Ex.PW-1/20) had been served upon the defendant asking him to
produce these originals.     As per the court record no reply had
been furnished to this notice. DW-1 in his cross-examination had
however admitted that he had sent a reply to the notice Ex.PW-
1/19 ( u/O 12 Rule 2 of the Code ) and Ex.PW-1/20 (u/O 12 Rule 8
of the Code); these replies are not on the court file as the same
had not been filed. This is a clear and categorical admission of
RSA No.243/2007                                           Page 5 of 7

the defendant.         DW-1 had further in his cross-examination
admitted :
      “All the bills through which I had purchased the goods from the
      plaintiff firm are also in my power and possession till today.”
11.   This admission of the defendant clearly establishes that the
impugned judgment rejecting the bills Ex.PW-1/1 to Ex.PW-1/18
for the reason that the originals have not been produced is clearly
a perversity; it is liable to be set aside. This finding is accordingly
set aside.
12.   Ex.PW-1/23 the statement of account was maintained by the
plaintiff in his regular course of business; as per testimony of PW1
the original cash book and ledger account on the basis of which
this statement account had been prepared had been tendered in
the court.    Not a single suggestion has been given to the PW-1
that this document is forged or fabricated.             Finding of the trial
judge rejecting Ex.PW-1/23           for the reason that they are loose
sheets of paper and original had not been produced is again a
perversity. This judgment is also set aside.
13.   Result is that the plaintiff has been able to prove that he had
through the aforenoted bills (Ex.PW-1/1 to Ex.PW-1/18) supplied
goods to the defendant; defendant had not denied his business
transactions with the plaintiff. The discussion noted supra
RSA No.243/2007                                                       Page 6 of 7

establishes and proves the case of the plaintiff.     The appellate
court had illegally ignored the evidence. Substantial question of
law is answered in favour of the appellant and against the
respondent. Appeal is allowed. Suit of the plaintiff is decreed.
