HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA

1.      A suit being CS No.168/11/92 (New suit No.293/2014) was filed by
Man Singh for partition and injunction. Subh Ram was the Defendant No.1
CM(M) 545/2015 & 551/2015                                          Page 1 of 4

in the suit who died and thus his legal heirs Ved Pal Singh, Shri Pal,
Rishipal, Smt. Indra, Smt. Kamlesh and Smt. Raj Rani were impleaded. In
the suit vide order dated 3rd December, 1994 an interim injunction
application was disposed of thereby restraining the Defendants including the
Petitioners herein from raising construction, addition and alternation in the
portion shown in yellow colour in the site plan and from transferring,
alienating or otherwise parting with the possession of the same till the
disposal of the suit.
2.      An application under Section 151 CPC was filed by the Petitioners,
that is, LRs of late Subh Ram seeking modification of the said injunction
order dated 3rd December, 1994 which was dismissed vide order dated 1 st
February, 2013 which is impugned in CM (M) No.545/2015. Another
application filed by the Petitioners, that is, LRs of deceased Subh Ram
prayed that the present suit be consolidated with another suit pending trial
being CS No.294/2014 instituted by the Petitioners and in order to avoid
repetition, the Petitioners want to adopt the evidence as produced by them in
Suit No.166/11/95 new number CS No.296/14 as the testimony of witnesses
cover the real controversy involved between the parties in the present suit.
This application was dismissed vide order dated 21 st March, 2015 which is
impugned in CM (M) No.551/2015.
3.      The Petitioners state that in case the injunction order dated 3rd
December, 1994 is not modified and they are not permitted to demolish the
existing structure of the property and reconstruct the same will endanger
their life and they would be on roads if the property falls down and thus they
may be permitted to make material structural changes to give support and
strength to the building and renew the same to make it fit for habitation of
CM(M) 545/2015 & 551/2015                                        Page 2 of 4

the applicants and their family. The suit property is in possession of the
Petitioners and besides residential, the same is used for commercial purpose
also. Photographs of the suit property were placed on record. Vide the
impugned order dated 1st February, 2013 the learned Trial Court held that the
evidence in the suit was completed on 19th August, 1998 and thereafter the
matter is lingering on one pretext or the other for deciding the miscellaneous
applications.       From a perusal of the photographs there appears to be no
eminent danger of the building falling and if the injunction order is modified
at this stage the very purpose of filing of the suit by the Plaintiff/Respondent
would be frustrated and the same would result in grave injustice and injury
and further delay in proceedings. Thus the application under Section 151
was dismissed with cost of Rs.3,000/-
4.     Before this Court learned counsel for the Petitioner re-agitates the
same pleas. This Court has also perused the photographs placed on record.
Though the structure is old one however, in no way it is dilapidated or on the
verge of collapsing. The finding of the learned Trial Court that despite the
evidence having been concluded in the year 1998 one after another
miscellaneous applications are being filed to prolong the proceedings cannot
be said to be without any basis and I find no reason to interfere in the said
order.
5.     As regards the order dated 21st March, 2015, impugned in CM (M)
No.551/2015 the learned Trial Court noted that the present suit was for
partition wherein the Plaintiffs had sought preliminary decree and partition
in respect of Gher/Gitwar measuring 1 Bigha comprised I Khasra No.173
min situated in Village Lado Sarai whereas in Suit No.296/14 permanent
injunction has been sought from raising any construction on the property F-
CM(M) 545/2015 & 551/2015                                           Page 3 of 4

118 measuring 260 sq. yards at Village Lado Sarai. The issues framed in the
two suits are entirely different and thus different evidence would have to be
led on the basis of the pleadings in the two suits. Further one such similar
application was withdrawn by the Petitioner vide order dated 19 th February,
2014.
6.     The main plea of learned counsel for the Petitioner before this Court is
that the Petitioners be permitted to adopt the evidence led by them in CS
No.296/2014 in the present suit, that is, Suit No.293/2014 and the cross-
examination be also restricted to the cross-examination already done and not
beyond thereto. As noted by the learned Trial Court the prayers in the two
suits are different and thus the pleadings are also different. The issues
framed in the two suits are different and hence no order can be passed
permitting the parties to adopt the evidence in Suit No.296/2014 and also
restricting the right of cross-examination.        The prayer made in the
application deserves to be rejected outright. I find no error in the impugned
orders.
7.     Petitions and applications are accordingly dismissed.
                                                          (MUKTA GUPTA)
