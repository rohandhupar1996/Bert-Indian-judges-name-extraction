1.      This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 20.05.1998
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi in sessions
case No. 123/1996 arising out of FIR No.261/1994 under Section 302
IPC registered at P.S. Pahar Ganj. The appellant has been convicted
CRL.A. No.119/1999                                            Page 1 of 4

for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and by virtue of the
order on sentence dated 21.05.1998 passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, he has been sentenced to undergo imprisonment for
life and to pay a fine of Rs. 1000/- and in default of payment of fine to
further undergo simple imprisonment for three months. The appeal is
also directed against the said order on sentence.
2.      During the pendency of the present appeal, the appellant Prem
Kumar had moved an application being Crl.M.A. 119/1999 claiming
that he was a juvenile on the date of the incident i.e., 22.05.1994.
Consequently, the appellant prayed that he be treated as a juvenile and
be dealt with under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act). While
disposing of the said application, a Division Bench of this Court, by
virtue of its order dated 04.05.2011, directed the Additional Sessions
Judge to conduct an inquiry with regard to the age of the appellant and
also directed that a report be submitted. The report of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge has been received which is dated
01.10.2011. As per the said report/order, the appellant has been found
to be of the age of 17 years 3 months and 17 days on the date of the
incident.

3.      There is no contest with regard to this determination by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge. As such, the appellant would have
to be treated as a juvenile within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the
said Act.
4.      We find that the appellant had already undergone incarceration
for about 10 years and 10 months when this court had granted him the
benefit of suspension of sentence and had directed his release on bail
by virtue of the order dated 26.05.2005.
5.      Keeping in mind the decisions of the Supreme Court in the
cases of Hari Ram v. State of Rajasthan & Anr (2009) 13 SCC 211
and Dharambir v. State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr 2010 (4) SCALE 316,
the consequent benefit under the said Act would have to be given to
the appellant. In view of the provisions of Section 15 and 16 of the
said Act, the appellant could not have been ‘detained’ for a period
extending beyond three years, whether in a special home or in a place
of safety. Since the appellant has already been in custody for a period
far in excess of the stipulated period of three years, he cannot be kept
under detention of any kind any further.
6.      The learned counsel for the appellant states that the appellant is
not interested in challenging his conviction but is only seeking the
CRL.A. No.119/1999                                            Page 3 of 4

benefit with regard to the sentence under the said Act. In view of
Section 20 of the said Act, while we do not disturb the finding of guilt
returned by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, the sentence
awarded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge is to be set aside.
The maximum period of detention under the said Act being only three
years, whether in a special home or any place of safety, no further
order under Section 15 or 16 of the said Act can be passed in view of
the fact that the appellant has already been in custody for over 10
years and 10 months.
7.      In view of the foregoing, while the conviction of the appellant
under Section 302 IPC is upheld, the sentence passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge is set aside. It is obvious that the appellant
will get the benefit of Section 19 of the said Act. The bail bonds are
cancelled and the surety stands discharged.
        The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
                                 BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
