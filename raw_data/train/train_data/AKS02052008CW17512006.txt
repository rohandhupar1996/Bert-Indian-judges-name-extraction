A.K. SIKRI, J.
                All these petitioners who have filed separate writ petitions are
claiming identical relief in a similar factual background. They are all retired
Air Force Officers who sought pre-mature retirement after getting offers
from Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs); and were subsequently absorbed in
the said PSUs. At the time of retirement, they opted to get their 100%
pension commuted.             On giving this option, they were paid lump sum
commuted pension. Obviously, since 100% pension was commuted, these
petitioners are not getting any monthly pension.                   After 15 years they
requested for restoration of their pension. The respondents have passed
orders restoring 43% of the commuted pension. The petitioners’ grievance
is that instead of 43%, full 100% pension should have been restored.                    In
addition, they have also pleaded that commutation of 100% pension at the
time of their retirement was not as per the Rules, as per which only 1/3rd of
the pension could have been commuted.                    Since legal issue is same in all
these petitions and flow from similar circumstances, our purpose would be
served by taking note of the facts of one case. We accordingly proceed to
state the factual merits of W.P.(C) No.1751 of 2006.
                The petitioner in this case joined Indian Air Force on
31.12.1967 and was commissioned as Pilot Officer in the Flying Branch. In
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06                     Pg.2 of 13

the due course he was selected and promoted to the ranks of Flying Officer,
Flight Lieutenant, Squadron Leader and then to the select rank of Wing
Commander. In the year 1988, the Indian Air Force sought volunteers from
specified category of officers i.e. Flying Helicopter Pilots to join M/s.Pawan
Hans Ltd., a Public Sector Undertaking which was facing Pilots crunch and
this was affecting its operations. The petitioner who fulfilled the terms on
the basis of which volunteers were sought, applied for permanent absorption
in Pawan Hans Ltd. through Air Head Quarters and was duly selected by the
Combined Selection Committee of M/s.Pawan Hans Ltd and Air Head
Quarters. He was thus granted pre-mature retirement by the Air Force on his
permanent absorption in the said Pawan Hans Ltd. w.e.f. 6.10.1988. At the
time of pre-mature retirement he had a total service of 20 years 10 months
and 6 days in the Indian Air Force. He was also entitled to weightage
element of 7 years for calculation of qualifying service for pension and on
reckoning this his pension was to be commuted on the basis of 28 years of
service. At the time of pre-mature retirement, he was drawing the pay of
Rs.5250/-per month. His retiring pension was fixed at Rs.1621/-per month.
According to the petitioner, it was less by Rs.609/-per month as weightage
element of 5 years has not been added to the qualifying service of the
petitioner for the calculation of gratuity.
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06            Pg.3 of 13

                The respondents had issued O.M. No.4/42/91-P & PW(d) dated
31.3.1995. As per para-3 thereof, if a retiring Air Force Officer wanted
pension to be commuted, he was to get 100% pension commuted. Thus the
petitioner filled up his form seeking 100% commutation of pension. His
request was accepted and lump sum amount was paid to the petitioner. After
15 years thereafter the respondents issued PPO No.08/14/A/0184 of 2004
which was received by the petitioner in August,2004. As per this PPO, the
respondents restored 43% out of the 100% commuted pension. Weightage
element of 5 years was also not given while commuting the pension. The
petitioner made representation to the respondents and according to the
petitioner he was informed that the matter regarding weightage element of
pension and gratuity was pending in the Supreme Court in Appeal No.2737
of 2002 and after the said case is decided the respondents shall implement
the judgment. However, since only 43% of commuted pension was restored
the petitioner filed the present writ petition with following prayers:
            A. “ Issue a writ of Certiorari or any other writ or directions
                quashing the Note-1 to para 5 of the respondents
                impugned executive order GOI, MOD No.1(5)/87/D
                (Pensions/Service) dated 30.10.1987 and declaring it
                illegal and in operative.
            B. Issue a writ of Certiorari or any other writ or directions
                quashing the PPO No.08/14/A/0215 of 1990 dated
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06              Pg.4 of 13

                16.3.1990 & Corr. PPO No.08/14/A/0184 of 2004 and
                declaring them ultravirus.
            C. Issue a writ of Certiorari or any other writ or directions
                quashing para 6(b) of the letter No.8(3)/86/A/D
                Pensions/Service) dated 19-2-1987 and declaring it ultra-
                virus.
            D. Issue a writ of Mandamus or any other writ or directions
                to the respondents to recalculate and release the pension
                and gratuity of the petitioner as the petitioner is entitled
                to the residuary pension (i.e. of weightage element) along
                with DA on the total pension month to month +
                weightage element of gratuity BOTH along with 12%p.a.
                interest and revisions if any.
            E. Issue a writ of Mandamus or any other writ or directions
                to the respondents to restore 100% of the commuted
                pension along with revision and DA.
            F. AND pass such other further orders in the interest of
                justice and circumstances of the case.”
            Insofar as prayer for giving weightage in the service for the
purpose of calculation of pension is concerned, the same has to be rejected
in view of authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the case of
Union of India Vs. A.S.Gangoli & others (2007) 6 SCC 196.                  In that
judgment the Supreme Court has categorically decided that such weightage
is not admissible after the implementation of recommendation of 5th Pay
Commission w.e.f. 1.1.1996.                 The learned counsel for the petitioner
conceded this legal position and, therefore, did not press this relief.
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06               Pg.5 of 13

                It is clear from the above that we are concerned with the
following two issues in these writ petitions:
    1. Legality and/or validity of the action of the respondents in
        commuting 100% of the pension.
    2. Restoration of 43% pension in stead of entire 100% which was
        commuted earlier.
        We now proceed to deal with the aforesaid two issues:
ISSUE NO.1
             The case of the petitioner is that as per the Pension Rules
governing these petitioners, not more than 43% of the pension should have
been commuted. This Pension Rule is in AFI 4/S which is to the following
effect:
                “COMMUTATION OF PENSION
                13. Officers may commute a portion not exceeding 43%
                and airmen, a portion not exceeding 45% of the revised
                rates of pension introduced by this Instruction, subject to
                the conditions and limitations prescribed in Pension
                Regulations, Part I, (1961).”
                It is the submission of the petitioner that contrary to the
aforesaid Rule, O.M. dated 19.2.1987 was issued dealing with the case of
officers on their permanent absorption in Central Public Enterprises and
para-6 thereof provided as under:
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06              Pg.6 of 13

                “6. Every absorptee will be required to exercise an
                option within six months of his absorption for either of
                the alternatives indicated below:
            (a) Receiving pro-rate monthly pension and Death-cum-
                Retirement gratuity as admissible under the rules.
            (b) Receiving Death Cum Retirement gratuity and a lump
                sum amount in lieu of monthly pro-rate pension, worked
                out with reference to the Commutation tables as
                obtaining on the date on which commuted value becomes
                payable.
                Where no option is exercised within the prescribed
                period the officer is automatically governed by
                alternative (b) above.”
                As per para-6 an absorptee was required to exercise his option
(a) or (b) within six months of his absorption in Public Sector Undertaking,
failing which his case was to be dealt with as per option (b).
                It was submitted that though Regulation provided commutation
of 43% of pension, but in view of OM dated 19.2.1987, the petitioner was
given no choice in the matter of commutation but to accept 100%
commutation of pension. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner was that
this provision was contrary to the Pension Regulation.
                In the counter-affidavit filed by the respondents, the
respondents have, inter alia, taken the plea that the petitioners had exercised
their option in terms of Clause-(b) of para-6 of the aforesaid OM and had
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06            Pg.7 of 13

received the benefit of commutation for 16 years. It is highlighted that the
petitioner was given a lump sum of Rs.2,89,835/- as commuted value of
100% pension on 16.3.1990 and, therefore, he cannot now turn around and
state that only 43% of the pension should have been commuted. We find
force in this contention of the respondents. The petitioner has filed the
present petition 16 years after he exercised his option on his own volition
and without any reservation and accepted the lump sum amount of pension.
In fact, as shall be noted hereafter while dealing with second issue, it is only
when part of pension is restored after the judgment of the Supreme Court the
petitioner has become wiser and is challenging the aforesaid action. The
OM dated 19.2.1987 dealt with specific aspect, namely, pro-rata pension
admissible to such officers who got themselves absorbed in Central Public
Undertaking. This specific provision contained in the said OM was never
challenged by the petitioners at the time of their pre-mature retirement on
their absorption in Pawan Hans Ltd. Not only they took the lump sum
amount, they enjoyed the said amount for all these years. It is clear from the
option exercised by them that they did not want to receive pro-rata pension
every month and instead wanted commutation. If the case of the petitioners
was that 100% pension should not be commuted and they should be allowed
to part of the pension in terms of Pension Regulation, they could have
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06            Pg.8 of 13

challenged para-6 contained in OM dated 19.2.1987 at that stage. Having
not done so at that time and voluntarily making an application for
commuting 100% pension, receiving the lump sum amount and keeping the
said amount for all these years with them, the petitioners would be estopped
from challenging the said action of the respondents at this distant of time.
That apart the writ petitions suffer from unexplained laches and delays in
coming to the Court after a gap of more than 15 years, challenging this
action. It is not possible to turn the clock back as it would create so many
administrative and other problems as well. We, therefore, do not find any
merit in this issue.
ISSUE No.2
                To appreciate as to why 43% of the commuted pension is
restored, we will have to take into consideration some of the judgments of
the Supreme Court wherein such kind of direction is given. In respect of
civil servants the Government passed the Central Service Commutation of
Pension Rules 1981. Under those Rules civil employees under Government
of India can commute up to 1/3rd of their pension. After 15 years of service
this 1/3rd of pension is allowed to be restored. As the similar provision for
restoration of commuted portion of pension was not available in the Pension
Regulation for Defence Personnel, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06          Pg.9 of 13

form of petition under Article 32 was filed, namely, Common Cause Vs.
Union of India and the judgment given in that case is reported as [1987] 1
SCR 497. The said petition was allowed and it was directed that after 15
years the commuted portion of pension in case of Armed Forces Personnel
be also restored. In case of Defence Personnel commutation is admissible
up to 43% ( in case of officers) and up to 45% in case of other ranks and,
therefore, direction was given for restoration of 43% pension in case of
Defence personnel as well. Thereafter, issue came up before the Supreme
Court in the case of Welfare Association of Absorbed Central Government
Employees in Public Enterprises and others Vs. Union of India and another
AIR 1996 SC 1201. Following earlier judgment in Common Cause case
(supra) the Supreme Court, inter alia, held that civilian/defence personnel
would be entitled to restoration of 1/3rd/43% of the pension as the case may
be. In this case the Court was primarily concerned with those Government
servants who after putting some years of Government service were allowed
to be absorbed in Public Sector Undertakings/Public Sector Enterprises. The
Court specifically took note of the fact that though as per the Pension Rules,
1/3rd of the pension could be commuted, such officers on their absorption
were also allowed to commute the balance 2/3rd of the pension, i.e., they
were allowed to commute full pension. This facility, therefore, created was
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06          Pg.10 of 13

in case of persons, namely, (1) the persons who had not commuted their
pension and therefore, were drawing full monthly pension from the
Government (2) the persons who had commuted 1/3rd of the pension and,
therefore, were drawing sliced monthly pension, reduced to the extent of
commuted amount and (3) the persons who had commuted the full pension
and were not getting any monthly pension by deeming monthly pension to
have been reduced to nil. The Court noted that while the persons falling in
the first category continue to derive all the benefits of being Government
pensioners and were getting all the Interim Reliefs, liberalization and /or
whatever reliefs were given by the Government, the persons in the second
category were denied these benefits to the extent of 1/3rd commutation
whereas third category was the worst hit as they were totally denied these
benefits. In normal course when full pension is commuted, there was no
question of restoration of the commuted pension which was applicable only
in those cases where up to 1/3rd of the pension was commuted. The Court,
however, following its earlier judgment in Common Cause case (supra)
directed that 1/3rd of pension for civilian and defence personnel respectively
be restored after the expiry of 15 years even when such a person had got
100% pension commuted.
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06          Pg.11 of 13

                On the basis of this judgment, Ministry of Personnel and Public
Grievances and Pensions, [Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare]
in the Government of India issued OM dated 30/9/1986. While allowing
1/3rd of commuted pension in case of civilian, similar benefit was extended
to defence personnel as well.                Para-4 of the said OM thus contained a
provision for restoration of 43% of their pension in the following manner:
                “4.The Armed Forces Personnel including officers under
                their Service Regulations are entitled to commutation of
                43% of their pension on their retirement in normal cases
                instead of 1/3rd commutation of pension that is
                admissible in the case of civilian Govt. servants.
                Accordingly, the Armed Forces Personnel who had
                commuted full pension shall be entitled to the restoration
                of 45% of their pension and the officers in the Armed
                Forces shall be entitled to the restoration of 43% of their
                pension in accordance with the above procedure.”
                Pursuant to this OM dated 19.2.1987 the petitioners before us
have been able to get their pension to the extent of 43% restored. This
action of the respondents thus clearly is in accordance with the aforesaid
judgment of the Supreme Court.                     But for the said judgment, these
petitioners, who got 100% of their pension commuted and received lump
sum amount, could not have got the benefit of restoration at all even after the
expiry of 15 years. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the petitioners are
W.P.(C) Nos. 1751/06, 3141/01, 20237/05, 21489/05, & 8716/06               Pg.12 of 13

not entitled to restoration of 100% of the commuted value. As a result, we
dismiss these petitions with no orders as to costs.
