1.      Heard Mr. D. Mazumdar, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr.
M. J. Quadir, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner. Also heard
Mr. Diganta, Das, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. G. Alam,
learned counsel representing the respondent No.4. Mr. D. Nath,
learned Senior Govt. Advocate, Assam, appears for respondent Nos.1
to 3. Since the respondent Nos. 5 to 7 did not contest the proceeding

before the Election Tribunal and no relief is claimed against them, with
the consent of the contesting parties, this writ petition is being
disposed off at the motion stage.
2.     In this writ petition the judgment and order dated 27.06.2017
passed by the learned District Judge –cum- Panchayat Election
Tribunal, Karimganj, declaring the respondent No.4 as the elected
candidate for post of President of 43 No. Panighat Gaon Panchayat
by reversing the poll results has been put to challenge.
3.      In the last Panchayat Election held on 12.02.2013, the writ
petitioner and the respondent Nos.4 to 7 had contested the polls for
the post of President of the Panighat Gaon Panchayat falling under
No.9 Sadarashi Lakshmibazar Zilla Parishad in the district of Karimganj.
The polling took place on 12.02.2013 and the counting of votes was
held on 14.02.2013 in the campus of Karimganj College, Karimganj.
The total number of votes polled in the election was 4524. After
completion of the counting, the petitioner was found to have secured
the highest number of 1608 votes and his nearest rival i.e. the
respondent No.4 had secured 1582 votes. Accordingly, the writ
petitioner was declared as the elected candidates by defeating his
nearest rival i.e. respondent No.4 by a margin of 26 votes.
4.     Aggrieved by the aforesaid result, the respondent No.4            as
election petitioner had challenged the election of the writ petitioner
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                           Page 2 of 15

by filing Misc. (Election) Case No.57/2013 before the Panchayat
Election Tribunal, Karimganj, inter-alia alleging that on the date of
counting there were as many as 10 counting agents deputed by the
election petitioner/respondent No.4 who had later informed him that
it was the respondent No.4/election petitioner who had actually
received 1608 number of votes and not the writ petitioner. On the
basis of such allegation the respondent No.4 had sought recounting of
the ballots.
5.     The writ petitioner/ returned candidate had contested the
Election Petition by filing written statement. On conclusion of trial, the
learned Election Tribunal had passed judgment and order dated
03.12.2014 directing recount of the ballots. The review application
being Misc. (Review) No.01/2015 preferred by the writ petitioner
against the order dated 03.12.2014 was rejected by the order dated
06.06.2015 as a result of which the writ petitioner had approached this
Court by filing CRP No.256/2015 which was also dismissed by the
judgment and order dated 08.01.2016 passed by this court. Even the
Special Leave Petition being SLP No.4688/2016 preferred by the writ
petitioner against the judgment and order dated 08.01.2016 came to
be dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court by order dated
23.02.2016.
6.     With the dismissal of the SLP, the judgment and order dated
03.12.2014 had attained finality and therefore, the process of
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                          Page 3 of 15

recounting of the ballots was undertaken by the Munsiff No.1,
Karimganj as per the order of the Election Tribunal. Thereafter, a report
dated 16.03.2016 was submitted by the learned Munsiff containing the
findings pertaining to the recounting of 1266 ballots held on
15.03.2016 and 16.03.2016. The recounting of the remaining ballots
could not be done since those ballot papers were not made available
for counting.
7.      Since the total number of votes polled in the election was 4524
and the report dated 16.03.2016 was only in respect of 1266 ballots,
hence, by the order dated 21.03.2016 passed in Misc. (Election) Case
No.57/2013, the learned Election Tribunal had called for a detailed
report to be submitted by the Munsiff No.1 regarding recounting of all
votes. As per the order dated 21.03.2016, recounting of the remaining
3238 ballots was carried out on 06.06.2016 and 07.06.2016 and a report
dated 08.04.2016 was submitted in respect thereof.
8.     As per the result of the re-count, the writ petitioner was shown to
have polled 1570 votes in total as against 1580 votes polled by the
respondent No.4. Taking note of the two reports submitted by the
Munsiff No.1, Karimganj, the impugned judgment and order dated
27.06.2017 was passed by the learned Election Tribunal in Misc.
(Election) Case No.57/2013 declaring that the total votes polled by the
respondent No.4 was 1580 as against 1570 votes polled by the writ
petitioner. On the basis of such findings, the respondent No.4 was
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                              Page 4 of 15

declared as the elected candidate by defeating the writ petitioner by
a margin of 10 votes.
9.     Referring to the impugned order dated 27.06.2017, Mr.
Mazumdar, learned senior counsel representing the writ petitioner,
submits that there is no dispute about the fact that the total number of
votes polled in the election is 4524. However, from the reports
submitted by the learned Munsiff based on the recounting of ballots, it
is apparent that the total number of ballots counted by the learned
Munsiff were only 4504 and as many as 20 ballots are missing. That
apart, submits Mr. Mazumdar, 16 ballots were found to be un-used
and another 21 ballots were treated to be doubtful votes by the
learned Munsiff on the ground that those ballots did not bear the full
signature of the Returning Officer but only had his initials. According to
Mr Mazumdar, 17 out of those 21 ballots treated as doubtful have
been cast in favour of the writ petitioner but those were neither
rejected nor taken into account while declaring the final result by the
learned Tribunal by the impugned order dated 27.06.2017. Since the
difference of votes between the writ petitioner and the respondent
no. 4 is only 10 votes, hence, in the absence of any clear finding as
regard the fate of those 21 votes, the result of the election could not
have been held to be materially affected warranting reversal of the
same.
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                             Page 5 of 15

10.     The learned senior counsel for the petitioner further submits that
there is no category of ‘doubtful’ votes under the Assam Panchayat
(Constitution) Rules, and as per Rule 44(3) a ballot paper can be
rejected only on the grounds mentioned therein. According to Mr.
Mazumdar, none of the grounds mentioned in Rule 44(3) is attracted in
the facts of the present case. Moreover, submits Mr. Mazumdar, the
learned Munsiff did not have the mandate to declare any of ballots as
doubtful. Since, those ballots have not been shown as rejected nor
has the learned Tribunal recorded any finding as regards those ballots,
the impugned judgment dated 27.06.2017, according to the learned
senior counsel, was not sustainable in the eye of law and hence, liable
to be set aside by this court. The learned senior counsel has also
assailed the validity of the impugned order on the ground that the re-
counting process having been conducted in two different dates, the
same stood vitiated on such count alone meriting recounting of the
ballots afresh.
11.    Mr. Diganta Das, learned senior counsel representing the
respondent No.4, submits that there are valid reasons as to why the
recounting could not be done in one go and that is because only
1266 out of the 4524 ballots polled in the election were found when
the sealed packets were opened before the learned Munsiff. He
submits that in the results sheet prepared on the basis of the
recounting      process  held   on  06.06.2017    and    07.06.2017,     the
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                            Page 6 of 15

representative of the writ petitioner had put his signature recording his
satisfaction as regards the process but it was only on 02.07.2017 that
the petitioner had filed an objection in the matter after a delay of
nearly a month, by way of an afterthought , only to make out a false
case. Mr. Das submits that the short fall of ballots in the recounting
process is only in respect of 4 ballots and if the 16 un-used ballots are
added to the 4504 ballots counted by the learned Munsiff, the total
figure will come to 4520 ballots as against 4524 ballots polled in the
election. Although the learned senior counsel has fairly admitted that
the impugned judgment and order dated 27.06.2017 does not clearly
spell out as to the manner in which 21 doubtful votes have been dealt
with in the recounting process, yet, by drawing the attention of this
Court to the conduct of the writ petitioner, more particularly the delay
on his part in raising objection in the matter, Mr. Das submits that the
decision and conclusion of the learned        Election Tribunal does not
merit interference by this Court in the facts and circumstances of the
present case.
12.    I have considered the rival submissions made by learned
counsel for the parties and have also perused the materials available
on record. As noted above, there is no dispute at the bar regarding
the fact that in the election held on 12.02.2013 there were altogether
five candidates including the writ petitioner and the respondent Nos.4
to 7 and the total number of votes polled in the election was 4524. It is
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                           Page 7 of 15

submitted by the learned counsel for the parties that 16 ballots had
been found inside the ballot box along with the counter-foils and
therefore, those have been kept out of the counting process by
treating them as unused. Since the challenge made by the writ
petitioner to the judgment and order dated 03.12.2014 directing re-
count of the votes has attained finality, the only issue that survives for
consideration in the present proceeding is as to whether the process
of recounting of the ballots and the declaration of results thereof has
been done correctly and in accordance with law.
13.    From the materials available on record it is seen that although a
direction was issued by the Election Tribunal for recount of all        the
ballots, yet, the Munsiff No.1, Karimganj, had received only 1266
ballots in the first lot and therefore, the re-counting process had to
remain confined to only those 1266 ballots. Accordingly, recounting of
those 1266 ballots were conducted on 15.03.2016 and 16.03.2016
whereafter, a report dated 08.04.2016 was submitted to the Election
Tribunal. The report dated 08.04.2016 indicates that out of the 1266
ballots, the writ petitioner had polled 441 votes including 7 postal
ballots; the respondent No.4 had polled 411 votes including 18 postal
ballots; the respondent No.5 had polled 189 votes including 1 (one)
postal ballot; the respondent No.6 had polled 80 votes including
1(one) postal ballot and the respondent No.7 had polled 43 votes. 102
rejected votes were found amongst those 1266 ballots.

14.    Thereafter, recounting of as many as 3238 number of ballots
appears to have been conducted by the learned Munsiff on
06.06.2016 and 07.06.2016 as per the order dated 21.03.2016 and
another report dated 07.06.2016 was submitted before the Election
Tribunal. As per the report dated 07.06.2017 the writ petitioner had
polled 1129 votes; the respondent No.4 had polled 1169 votes; the
respondent No. 5 had polled 421 votes; respondent No 6 had polled
201 votes and the respondent No 7 had polled 41 votes. 256 (218+38 )
votes were found to have been rejected. 16 ballots, excluding the 256
rejected votes has been shown as “un-used” ballots. That apart, 21
votes have been shown to be “doubtful” out of which 17 had been
admittedly polled by the writ petitioner and the remaining 4 were in
favour of the respondent No.5.
15.    By interpolating the findings of the recounting process        as
appearing from the two reports dated 08.04.2016 and 07.06.2016
submitted by the learned Munsiff No.1, Karimganj, the picture that
emerges is given here-under in a tabular form :-
Sl.     Candidate                   Original result  Result of recount
No.
1.      Writ petitioner              1608             1570
2       Respondent No.4              1582             1580
3       Respondent No.5               613              610
4       Respondent No.6               285              281
5       Respondent No.7                85               84
               Total     =          4273             4125
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                        Page 9 of 15

Total number of rejected votes in original counting process = 351
Total number of rejected votes in the recounting process       = 358.
16.     From the aforementioned table, it is thus clear that all the 4524
ballots polled in the election were not available during the process of
recounting and only 4520 ballots were ultimately counted. The report
dated 07.06.2016 clearly indicates that 16 unused ballots did not form
part of the 256 rejected votes nor were those ballots counted in favour
of any of the candidates. It would be interesting to note herein that as
per the figures emerging from the re-counting process, the total
number of ballots counted in favour of the five candidates including
the 358 rejected ballots adds upto 4483 ballots. Therefore, taking the
figure of total votes polled in the election as 4524, there is clearly a
deficiency of 41 votes. Out of these 41 votes, 16 appear to be the un-
used ballots and 21 belong to the “doubtful” category which means 4
ballots are missing. It, therefore, becomes evident on the face of the
record that those 21 votes marked as “doubtful” have not been
counted in favour of any of the candidates in the recounting process.
17.   From the discussions made here-in before, it is apparent that the
21 ballots marked as “doubtful” out of which, the writ petitioner has
polled 17 votes, had not been counted in favour of the petitioner in
the re-counting process. From a reading of the impugned order dated
27.06.2017, it is also not clear as to the manner in which those 21 votes
have been dealt with by the learned Tribunal. There is also nothing on
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                            Page 10 of 15

record to establish as to the reason why those 21 votes had been
marked as doubtful.
18.     It is to be noted here-in that those 21 votes have neither been
rejected by the learned Munsiff nor by the Election Tribunal but has
merely been marked as doubtful. Therefore, those votes cannot be
treated as rejected. If the 17 votes polled by the writ petitioner out of
those 21 “doubtful” votes are counted in his favour, then it would be
the writ petitioner who will emerge as the winning candidate even
after the re-counting of ballots. In other words, if the 21 doubtful ballots
are treated as valid votes, then 17 of those would have to be counted
in favour of the writ petitioner in which event, the total number of
votes polled by the writ petitioner would go up to 1587 i.e. higher than
the figure of 1580 which is shown to have been polled by the
respondent No.4.
19.            In the above context, the findings recorded by the learned
Tribunal in paragraph 8 and 9 of the impugned judgment and order
dated 27.06.2017 would be relevant and are therefore, extracted
here-in below :-
       “8.      The aforesaid showed the following position so far as the
       number of valid votes secured by the contestants in the said
       election is concerned.
                The Petitioner                              :     1580
                The principal respondent number 1           :     1570
                The pro-forma Respondent number 5           :     610
                The Pro-forma Respondent number 6           :     281
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                             Page 11 of 15

               The Pro-forma Respondent number 7           :      84
       The two reports showed that the total number of 102 + 256 = 356
       ballots were found rejected in both the counting done by him.
       The reports also shows that 21 numbers of doubtful votes and 16
       numbers of unused ballots were also found. This shows that the
       total number of ballot papers handled by the learned Munsiff
       number 1, Karimganj was 4520 as against 4524 number of votes
       stated to have been used in the said election.
       9.      Vide petition number 4 dated 02.07.2016, the Principal
       Respondent number 1 raised the point that the total number of
       ballots used in the Gaon panchayat election was 4524 and that
       the total number of ballots handled by the learned Munsiff
       number 1, Karimganj was 4504 which, according to him, means
       that there was a shortage of 20 number of ballot papers. In the
       said petition, he has raised the issue that on the box of the ballot
       papers produced on the 2nd occasion on direction by this
       Tribunal, the boxes were found not intact, and that loose
       packets of cloth were seen which meant that the trunk
       containing ballot boxes was mishandled. However, the report of
       the learned Munsiff number 1 dated 13.06.2016 clearly states
       that the trunk was found sealed, and after unsealing the trunk
       two bags containing ballot papers were found therein. The
       report clearly states that the same was unsealed in presence of
       the concerned parties and their learned counsels. The report of
       the learned Munsiff number 1, does not show that any objection
       with regards the trunk not being in a sealed condition was raised
       by the Principal Respondent No.1. The petition number 04 dated
       02.07.2016 also does not show that any objection was raised
       and disallowed in the said regard. As such, the objection at the
       belated stage regarding unsealed trunk of the ballot papers
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                            Page 12 of 15

       having been produced before this Court and then to the
       learned Munsiff number 1 at Karimganj cannot be accepted
       and is rejected.”
20.    A plain reading of the observations made in the judgment and
order dated 27.06.2017 leaves no manner of doubt that the results of
the poll has been reversed by the learned Tribunal without recording
a proper finding as to fate of the 21 votes. Since the difference of
votes polled by the two candidates is only 10, hence, these 21 votes
would have a decisive impact on the final outcome of the results. As
such, the failure on the part of the learned Election Tribunal to clearly
record a finding on the 21 votes, in my opinion, would have a vitiating
effect on the decision and conclusion drawn by the learned Tribunal.
21.    Coming to the plea of the writ petitioner as regards the
piecemeal recounting process adopted by the learned Munsiff, since
the petitioner had participated in the process without raising any
objection, I am not inclined to entertain the said plea of the petitioner
on the point of validity of the re-counting process merely on the
ground that the same had been done in a piecemeal manner.
22.       For the reasons sated here-in above, I am of the considered
opinion that the impugned judgment and order dated 27.06.2017 is
not sustainable in the eye of law and the same is accordingly set
aside.

 23.   The matter is remanded back to the learned Election Tribunal
to pass a fresh order after recording a clear finding as to the fate of
the 21 votes marked as “doubtful”. In doing so, the learned Tribunal
shall be at liberty to direct a fresh re-count, if the same is found to be
necessary in the facts and circumstances of the case. Considering the
submission of Mr. Das that the term of the present Panchayat body will
come to an end in the month of December, 2017, it is hereby
observed that an attempt be made to complete the exercise, as
directed by this Court, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a
period of 30 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
24.         Before parting with the records, it would be pertinent to
mention here that this writ petition was initially listed for motion hearing
on 06.07.2017 and was fixed again on 12.07.2017 and thereafter on 17-
07-2017.    Since,   the   order   dated   27.06.2017      had    not   been
implemented, hence, a prayer was made by the petitioner’s counsel
for suspending the operation of the same. However, taking note of a
categorical assurance given by the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Das to
the effect that his client would not take oath till the next date, no
interim order was passed by this court. Today when the matter was
called up, Mr. Das submits that, going against the advice of the
counsel, his client has taken oath of office and has taken over charge.
Mr. Das has tendered apology on behalf of his client for the above
conduct and has requested this court not to initiate any contempt
WP(C) No.4034/2017                                               Page 14 of 15

proceeding against the respondent No.4. Although, the conduct of
the respondent No 4, prima facie, merits initiation of a contempt
proceeding, yet, considering the fact that there was no formal order
from the court restraining the said respondent and having regard to
the peculiar facts of the case, taking note of the apology tendered by
the learned senior counsel, this court refrains from initiating any
contempt proceeding against the respondent No.4 but cautions him
not to repeat such conduct in the future. It is, however, made clear
that until such time the matter is considered afresh and a
consequential order is passed by the learned Election Tribunal, the writ
petitioner would continue to function as the President of 43 No.
Panighat Gaon Panchayat for the present term.
