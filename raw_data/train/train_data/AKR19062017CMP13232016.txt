                   HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                            C.M.P. No.1323 of 2016
   In the matter of an application under Articles 226 & 227 of the
   Constitution of India.
                                   -----------
   Subodha Chandra Ghose                       ….         Petitioner
                                             Versus
   Smt. Jayanti Ghose & others                 ….         Opposite Parties
            For Petitioner          …    Mr. D.P Mohanty, Advocate
            For Opposite parties    …    Mr. P.K. Dasmohapatra, Advocate
                            JUDGMENT
   PRESENT:
              THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
   Date of hearing: 19.06.2017        :      Date of judgment: 19.06.2017
DR.A.K.RATH, J.      This petition challenges the order dated 10.8.2016
   passed by the learned Addl. District Judge, Balasore in R.F.A.
   No.01/189 of 2015/12. By the said order, the lower appellate court
   rejected the application of the petitioner under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC
   for admitting certain documents as additional evidence.
   02.          Opposite parties as plaintiffs instituted C.S. No.771/167
   of 2010/2000 in the court of learned Civil Judge (Senior Division),
   Jaleswar for partition of Schedule-Ka property and declaration of title
   in respect of Schedule Ka/1 property impleading the petitioner as
   defendant. The suit was decreed. Challenging the judgment and
   decree, the petitioner filed RFA No.01/189 of 2015/2012 in the court
   of learned Addl. District Judge, Balasore. In the appeal, an
   application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC has been filed to admit

                                      2
certain documents as additional evidence. The same has been
rejected.
03.         Heard Mr. D.P Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner
and Mr. P.K. Dasmohapatra, learned counsel for the opposite parties.
04.         The question does arise as to whether the learned
appellate court can consider the application for additional evidence at
any stage of the appeal ?
05.         The subject-matter of dispute is no more res integra. This
Court in Sankar Pradhan v. Premananda Pradhan (dead) and others,
2015 (II) CLR 583 held thus:
             “7. In Parsotim Thakur and others Vrs. Lal Mohar
            Thakur and others, AIR 1931 Privy Council 143, it is held
            that under Cl.(1) (b) of Rule 27 it is only where the
            appellate Court “requires” it, (i.e., finds it needful) that
            additional evidence can be admitted. It may be required to
            enable the Court to pronounce judgment or for any other
            substantial cause, but in either case it must be the Court
            that requires it. This is the plain grammatical reading of
            the sub-clause. The legitimate occasion for the exercise of
            this discretion is not whenever before the appeal is heard
            a party applies to adduce fresh evidence, but “when on
            examining the evidence as it stands some inherent lacuna
            or defect becomes apparent.” It may well be that the
            defect may be pointed out by a party or that a party may
            move the Court to supply the defect, but the requirement
            must be the requirement of the Court upon its
            appreciation of the evidence as it stands. Wherever the
            Court adopts this procedure it is bound by Rule 27(2) to
            record its reasons for so doing (emphasis laid). The same
            view was taken by this Court in the cases of
            Banchhanidhi Behera Vrs. Ananta Upadhaya and others,
            AIR 1962 Orissa 9 and State Bank of India Vrs.
            M/s.Ashok Stores & others, 53 (1982) C.L.T.552.”
            (emphasis laid)
06.         In view of the authoritative pronouncement of this Court
in the case of Sankar Pradhan (supra), the order dated 10.8.2016
passed by the learned Addl. District Judge, Balasore in R.F.A.
No.01/189 of 2015/12 is quashed. The learned lower appellate court
shall consider the application for additional evidence at the time of

                                    3
hearing of the appeal. Since the appeal is of the year 2012, the
learned appellate court shall dispose of the same within a period of
three months.
07.         The petition is allowed.
                                           …..……………………..
                                             DR. A.K.RATH, J.
Orissa High Court, Cuttack.
