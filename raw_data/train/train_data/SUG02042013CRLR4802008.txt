                          JUDGMENT
1.     Impugned order of 26th May, 2008 upholds petitioner's
conviction and sentence for the offence under Section 138 of The
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. While entertaining this revision
                                             th
petition, it stands noted in the order of 12 February, 2009 that
petitioner has already served sentence of 11 months out of
substantive sentence of one year imposed upon him. However,
the sentence of compensation of `1,12,000/- imposed was stayed
vide aforesaid order.

2.     Finding returned in the impugned order is as under: -
       "Having heard the arguments and after perusal of the
       case file I do not find any infirmity or illegality in the
       order of ld. MM for the reasons that complainant has
       proved his case and accused also does not dispute
       having given cheques to the complainant but his only
       defence is that it was given on account of complainant
       being successful in bid of committee. Original
       agreement as per complainant is in custody of accused
       so there is no question of producing the same by the
       complainant. However, DW2 and DW3 simply mentions
       that accused gave a cheque of Rs.56,000/-.
             They do not refer that three cheques of different
       amount were given. Had there been any committee
       secured by the complainant there would not have been
       any necessity to give three cheques dated 5.10.02,
       10.10.02 and 12.10.02 and only one cheque of last date
       12.10.02 would have been given. DW3 could not even
       give the exact month and year of giving of such cheque
       to the complainant. No such suggestion to complainant
       that cheques were given in presence of the committee
       members including DW2 and DW3. The defence
       witnesses are not believable. There is no suggestion was
       given to complainant that on what account Rs.6000/-
       were encashed by him so no benefit can be given to
       accused on this count. Had, there being any committee
       organized for releasing remaining monthly instalments,
       accused would have taken advance cheques from
       complainant, as is the usual practice. In the obtaining
Crl. Rev.P. No.480/2008                                      Page 2 of 7

       facts and circumstances I uphold the judgment and
       order on sentence."
3.     During the course of hearing, learned counsel for petitioner
had drawn attention of this Court to the answer given by petitioner in
his statement under Section 281 of the Cr. P.C., which reads as
under: -
          "I had to give a sum of Rs.56000/- to the
          complainant. I had given a cheque of Rs.6000/- to the
          complainant which had been encashed. I was running
          a committee and the complainant was a member. The
          complainant took the 8th committee in a bid. The
          complainant has to give a sum of Rs.27,002/-. I have
          to give a balance of Rs.22,998/- to the complainant. I
          have sent the reply to the legal notice."
4.     Petitioner had led evidence in his defence before the trial court
to show that petitioner had infact paid ` 6,000/- by way of cheque.
Attention of this Court was also drawn to the deposition of Mr.
Sanjay Kochar (DW-1), from petitioner's bank, who had deposed in
respect of certified copy of cheque Ex. DW-1/1 to show that the
cheque for a sum of `6,000/- was issued by petitioner in favour of
respondent-complainant herein. Attention of this Court was also
drawn to statement of account Ex. CW-1/C of petitioner to show that
an amount of `6,000/- was debited from his account in favour of
respondent on 18th September, 2002.

5.     At the hearing, the contention advanced on behalf of petitioner
is that the liability of petitioner was for lesser amount than the
cheque amount and so no enforceable debt or liability was there and
ingredients of Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
were not satisfied and so, impugned conviction and sentence
imposed upon the appellant is illegal and liable to be set aside.
Respondent's counsel had chosen not to contest this petition at final
hearing.
6.     In support of above submissions, reliance was placed by
petitioner's counsel upon decisions in Krishan Janardhan Bhat v.
Dattatraya G. Hegde (2008) 4 SCC 54; Suman Sethi v. Ajay K.
Churiwal and Anr. AIR 2000 SC 828; M/s. Alliance Infrastructure
Project Pvt. Ltd. And Ors. V. Vinay Mittal and Sanjeev Kapur II
(2010) BC 203, 2010(2) Crimes 672; M/s. BSI Ltd. & Anr. V. Gift
Holdings Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. AIR 2000 SC 926 and Angu Parameswari
Textiles (P) v. Sri Rajam & Co. in Crl. O.P. No. 24075 of 2000
rendered on 24th January, 2001 by Madras High Court.
7.     After considering the submissions advanced, the evidence on
record and the decisions cited, I find that there can be no quarrel
with the proposition of law enunciated in the above cited decisions,
but what is required to be seen is that whether the ratio of the
decisions cited has any application to the facts of the case in hand.
No doubt, criminal prosecution under Section 138 of The Negotiable
Crl. Rev.P. No.480/2008                                    Page 4 of 7

Instruments Act, 1881 is neither for recovery of money nor for
enforcement of any security etc., but, in the instant case, evidence on
record does not go to show that there was any kind of transaction as
alleged by petitioner-accused, who is bound by his own Affidavit
(Mark-A) which reveals that there was an existing debt/liability
attracting the provisions of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
So, the ratio of the decisions cited does not apply to the instant case.
8.     As regards payment of `6,000/- by cheque to respondent-
complainant by petitioner is concerned, I find that there is no cross-
examination of respondent-complainant on this aspect. However,
the evidence of Sanjay Kochar (DW-1) substantiates the stand taken
by petitioner regarding his paying `6,000/- to respondent-
complainant on 18th September, 2002.           It is so evident from
petitioner's bank statement Ex.CW1/C. But petitioner's counsel had
not addressed any meaningful         argument    during the course of
hearing to discredit petitioner's Affidavit (Mark-A), which clearly
proves that it was a loan transaction. Therefore, even if petitioner
had    paid `6,000/- to respondent-complainant, still petitioner is
liable to pay the balance loan amount of `50,000/- to respondent-
complainant.      In the ultimate analysis, impugned orders stands
modified to the aforesaid extent.
9.     At the hearing before this Court, it was urged by petitioner's
counsel that petitioner is a tailor by profession, who is earning just
Crl. Rev.P. No.480/2008                                       Page 5 of 7

`10,000/- per month and has wife and two school going children to
support and is living in rented accommodation and has already faced
the agony of these proceedings since the year 2003 and so, a lenient
view be taken on point of sentence.
10.    It has to be kept in mind that petitioner has already faced these
proceedings for more than one decade and that he has already
remained behind bars in this case for 11 months as noted in this
Court's order of 12th February, 2009. In the above background, this
Court finds that ends of justice would be met, if the substantive
sentence imposed upon petitioner-accused is reduced to the period
already undergone by him. On the quantum of compensation
awarded, I find that there is no scope for taking a lenient view as
petitioner-accused had settled this matter before the Mediation
Centre and then had backed out before the trial court and has
contested this matter before this Court in spite of his admitting his
liability to pay respondent-complainant in his Affidavit (Mark-A).
Such a conduct of an accused cannot persuade any court to take a
lenient view. So, now the compensation payable to respondent-
complainant would be double the existing liability i.e. `1,00,000/-
(Rupees One Lac). It is ordered accordingly.
11.    To the above extent, order on sentence passed against
petitioner stands modified while directing petitioner to deposit the
Crl. Rev.P. No.480/2008                                       Page 6 of 7

compensation amount of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac) with the trial
court within 12 weeks from today failing which petitioner shall
undergo simple imprisonment for three months. Trial court be
apprised of this decision forthwith to ensure its compliance.
12.    This petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
                                               (SUNIL GAUR)
