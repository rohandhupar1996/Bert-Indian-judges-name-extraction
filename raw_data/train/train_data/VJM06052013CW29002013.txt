CORAM:
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE VALMIKI J.MEHTA
  To be referred to the Reporter or not?
 VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J (ORAL)
1.            This writ petition is filed by one Sh.Ram Avtar who is presently the
employee of respondent No.3/M/s. National Thermal Power Corporation
Limited.    Petitioner seeks change of his date of birth from 3.6.1953 to
5.12.1955.     Alongwith the writ petition, the petitioner has filed his LTC
applications as also medical record book showing that the petitioner’s date of
birth as 5.12.1955. It is also argued that the petitioner had given an affidavit
WPC 2900/2013                                                                  Page 1 of 3

way back in the year 1978 showing his date of birth as 5.12.1955. Finally, it is
argued that as regards one Sh. Jwala Prasad his date of birth has been taken as
per the affidavit filed whereas the petitioner is discriminated against by not
relying upon his affidavit of his date of birth given at the time for his joining.
2.           It is settled law that no person has a right at the fag end of his
service to seek alteration in his date of birth.         In fact the petitioner has
deliberately concealed material documents inasmuch as counsel for the
respondent No.3 has filed in Court the letter of the petitioner given about 13
years back on 13.9.2000 whereby date of birth was sought to be corrected to
5.12.1955 and which representation of the petitioner was rejected way back on
22.9.2000. If the petitioner was aggrieved by the decision dated 22.9.2000
refusing to correct his date of birth, petitioner ought to have immediately
approached the Court thereafter and not after about 13 years in the year 2013.
3.           I may also note that the record which is relied upon by the
petitioner of LTC applications and medical record are in fact filled in by the
petitioner himself as per the statement made before me by the counsel for the
respondent No.3, and the petitioner therefore cannot rely on self-serving
documents which have been conveniently filled in by him, more so because his
representation for change of date of birth has been rejected way back in the year
2000.
WPC 2900/2013                                                                 Page 2 of 3

4.          In view of the above, there is no merit in the writ petition, which is
accordingly dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
