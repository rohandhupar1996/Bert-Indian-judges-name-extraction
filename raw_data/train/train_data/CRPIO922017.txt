                             THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

                                         BEFORE
                  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE KALYAN RAI SURANA
        Advocates for the Petitioners        : Mr. PK Deb Roy,

        Date of judgment and order           : 07.06.2017.
                            JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
           This matter has been taken up for hearing at the admission stage. I
have heard Mr. T. Roy, the learned Counsel for the petitioners and Mr. G.N.
Sahewalla, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Ms. B. Sarma, the learned Counsel
for the respondent.
2)         The order dated 02.11.2016 passed by the learned Munsiff No.1,
Cachar, Silchar, in T.S. No. 61/2011 is impugned in this application under Article
227 of the Constitution of India, by which the petition filed by the petitioners/
defendants under section 30 read with section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code to
call for the records and to order production of two registered deeds from the
Sub- Registry, Cachar, was rejected.
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                                   Page 1 of 10

3)         Owing to the nature of reliefs as sought for in this revision, it is not
deemed necessary to burden this judgment with the respective pleadings of the
parties.
4)         The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that on
02.11.2016, which was the date fixed for filing of evidence-on- affidavit by the
defendants, the petitioners filed a petition under section 30 read with section 151
of the Civil Procedure Code containing the prayer to pass an order to call for the
two registered deeds from the Sub- Registry at Cachar and to direct the
concerned to produce the said records and to depute one capable person to
prove the genuine one.
5)         The learned Munsiff No.1, Silchar by an order dated rejected the said
petition, which was numbered as Petition No. 181/07 dated 02.11.2016, and
closed the evidence of the defendant’s side. Aggrieved by the said order dated
02.11.2016, the present application has been filed.
6)         As per the said impugned order, the evidence of the defendant’s side
was closed by order dated 06.11.2013 and the suit was posted for argument on
29.11.2013. The original defendant thereafter, approached this Court by filing
CRP No. 111/2013 challenging the order dated 06.11.2013. During the pendency
of the said revision, the original defendant had died and the present petitioners
were substituted in place of the deceased defendant. After substitution was
allowed, the present petitioners were allowed to file their written statement and
by filing petition No. 76/22, the petitioners made a prayer before the learned trial
court to allow them to adduce defendant’s witness. The said CRP No. 111/13 was
disposed off by this Court by order dated 10.06.2016 by directing the learned
trial court to take up the herein before mentioned petition No. 76/22 for
consideration.
7)         Thereafter, by order dated 09.08.2016, the learned trial court allowed
petition No. 76/22 on condition that the petitioners- defendants shall adduce
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                               Page 2 of 10

their evidence on the next date i.e. 17.09.2016. However, on 17.09.2016, the
petitioners herein did not examine their witness but prayed for adjournment on
the ground that they did not receive the certified copies required for giving
evidence. As per order dated 17.09.2016, the learned trial court held that
although the prayer for adjournment did not deserve to be allowed, but for the
ends of justice, the adjournment was reluctantly allowed with a cost of Rs.500/-
as condition precedent, and also with a condition that the petitioners- defendants
shall adduce evidence without fail on the next date, i.e. 02.11.2016. However, on
02.11.2016, the petitioners instead of adducing their evidence, took up a plea
that they had applied for certified copies which are yet to be received.
8)         The learned trial Court had held that the petitioners had not disclosed
that for which document, they had applied for the certified copies or the date
when such copies were applied for, or for what reasons the copies were not
received by the petitioners. It was further held that the records does not reveal
why the petitioners could not make prayer for production of the documents at an
early stage or on 17.09.2016, even when they knew that they were required to
adduce their evidence on 17.09.2016 without fail. Hence, by arriving at a finding
that the petitioners were negligent and as the suit was an old pending suit, the
petition was not liable to be allowed. Resultantly, the evidence of the defendants
was closed and the suit was fixed for final argument.
9)         The learned counsel for the petitioners submit that the court had
inherent power to allow adjournment as sufficient causes were shown which
prevented the petitioners from adducing their evidence in the suit. It is also
submitted that the past conduct of the petitioners could not have been made a
ground to reject their genuine prayer for adjournment. It is also submitted that
the document, if allowed to be produced, would enable the learned trial court to
effectually decide the real issues in controversy. The learned counsel for the
petitioners submits that if the documents are allowed to be produced, the
respondent- plaintiff would not be prejudiced as the said documents are referred
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                               Page 3 of 10

in the written statement filed by the petitioners. In support of his argument, the
learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the case of K.K. Velusamy V.
N. Palanisamy, reported in (2011) 11 SCC 275. Para 14 thereof, on which the
learned counsel for the petitioners has relied on, is quoted below:-
                      “14. Neither the trial court nor the High court considered the
                      question whether it was a fit case for exercise of discretion
                      under section 151 or Order 18 Rule 17 of the Code. They
                      have not considered whether the evidence sought to be
                      produced would either assist in clarifying the evidence led on
                      the issues or lead to a just and effective adjudication. Both
                      the courts have mechanically dismissed the application only
                      on the ground that the matter was already at the stage of
                      final arguments and the application would have the effect of
                      delaying the proceedings.”
10)        The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, by referring to the
order dated 09.08.2016 passed by the learned trial court, submits that on
09.08.2016, the learned counsel for the respondent- plaintiff had advanced their
argument and after completion of the argument, the petitioners had filed petition
No. 76/22. On all the grounds, now being urged by the petitioners before this
Court, the learned trial court by exercising powers under section 151 of the Civil
Procedure Code, had allowed the petitioners to adduce evidence on the next date
fixed without fail and, as such, the learned trial court had already exercised
power under section 151 to grant some more time till 17.09.2016 for evidence of
the defendant’s side, with a rider that the defendants shall file their evidence
without fail. It is further submitted that despite the direction contained in the
said order dated 09.08.2016, the petitioners- defendants filed yet another
petition on 17.09.2016, praying for more time to file evidence on the ground that
the certified copies required for adducing evidence are not yet received.
However, the learned trial court showed leniency towards the petitioner and
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                                Page 4 of 10

although it was observed in the order that the petition does not deserve to be
allowed, for ends of justice, one last opportunity was afforded to the petitioners
to adduce evidence with the cost of Rs.500/- as condition precedent and also on
condition that the petitioners- defendants shall adduce their evidence on
02.11.2016 without fail.
11)         The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, by referring to the
petition No. 181/7 dated 02.11.2016, has submitted that there was no prayer to
recall the previous orders dated 17.09.2016 passed by the learned trial court
and, as such, there was no way for the learned court below to review its orders
and call for production of the documents at such a belated stage. It is further
submitted that despite rejection of the petition dated 02.11.2016, the petitioners
did not make any effort to obtain certified copy of relevant document and did not
present their evidence on the next date, but once again filed petition No. 114/21
dated 06.01.2017 under section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code with a prayer to
call for three registered deeds now and allow the petitioners to adduce evidence.
It is submitted that previously, the petitioners wanted two documents to be
called for, which has now increased to three documents. The learned trial court,
by order dated 07.01.2017 rejected the said petition and the suit was fixed for
argument on 10.01.2017. But on 10.01.2017, the petitioners had filed yet
another adjournment petition to defer argument on the ground that the
documents for preparing for argument could not be procured. It is further
submitted that even today, in course of argument, the petitioners could not make
a statement whether the certified copy of relevant documents has been obtained
or not and, as such, no ground is made out for interfering with the impugned
order.
12)         It is further submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the
respondent that in the petition No. 181/7 dated 02.11.2016 as well as in the
present revision application, there is no statement that the document, sought to
be called/ produced was covered by appropriate pleadings in the written
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                              Page 5 of 10

statement, because the court cannot look into any amount of evidence which is
not backed by pleadings. It is also submitted that the two documents mentioned
in the said petition No. 181/7 dated 02.11.2016 were dated 30.09.1985 and
10.10.1980, while the additional third document mentioned in petition No.
114/21 dated 06.01.2017 is dated 06.01.2017, but there is no explanation why
the same could not be filed along with the written statement though the said
documents were all pre-existing documents. Hence, this was a case of absence
of due diligence on part of the petitioners during trial.
13)        The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has submitted that the
power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India must be exercised with great
caution and circumspection and only when the order passed by the court or
tribunal under its jurisdiction has acted in violation of the well established
principles of law, or if the order is vitiated by perversity or to otherwise keep the
courts or tribunals within the bounds of law. It is submitted that the power ought
not to be exercised in a routine manner as if it was hearing an appeal. It is
submitted that on 09.08.2016, when the learned trial Court had allowed the
petitioners to adduce evidence, they were aware of the requirement of proving
documents, but the petitioners were not ready with their evidence and
resultantly, the disposal of the suit has been delayed for 10 months now.
14)         Having heard the arguments advanced by the learned Counsels for
the parties, I have perused the materials available on record. There is no
reference to any of the three documents sought to be called/ produced by the
petitioners in the written statement filed on 08.09.2011. Similarly, there is no
reference to any of the said three documents in the written statement filed on
29.05.2014 by the substituted defendants No. 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c), i.e. the
petitioners. Therefore, prima facie, I find that the petitioners do not have any
pleadings in respect of registered deed dated 17.10.1970, 10.10.1980 and
30.09.1985. It is a trite law that a Court cannot be permitted to look into any
amount of evidence upon a plea which was never put in the pleadings. In this
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                                 Page 6 of 10

connection, I find support from the case of Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal &
anr., reported in (2008) 17 SCC 491. This is the first ground on which I am
disinclined to grant any relief to the petitioners.
15)         It is observed that the petitioners had filed a petition before the
learned Trial Court under the provisions of section 30 read with section 151 of
the Civil Procedure Code. It is a trite law that the provisions of section 151
cannot be invoked when there exists appropriate provisions for the same in the
Code and that it cannot be used to nullify any other provisions of law. In light of
above, as the Civil Procedure Code puts a bar to introduction of any document in
evidence without the leave of the Court under the provisions of sub-Rule (3) of
Rule 14 of Order VII of the Code, I am constrained to hold that the express bar
created thereunder cannot be overcome by invoking the inherent power of the
Civil Court under section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, which, if allowed,
would nullify the provisions of sub-Rule (3) of Rule 14 of Order VII of the Code.
In this I find support from the case of P.S. Kona Anal Vs. The State of Manipur &
4 others, reported in (1989) 2 GLR 142. I also find support from the case of
Meera Chouhan V. Harsh Bishnoi, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 201, where the
Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down that powers under section 151 of the Civil
Procedure Code must be exercised only in exceptional circumstances for which
the Code lays down no procedure. Therefore, in my opinion, notwithstanding the
dismissal of the said petition, the application for introducing documents in the
stage of documents could not have been entertained by applying inherent power
of the Court under section 151 of the Code, for which exceptional circumstances
must exist and successfully demonstrated before the learned Trial Court.
16)         As the said petition filed before the learned Trial Court was also under
section 30 of the Civil Procedure Code, it is deemed fit to examine the provisions
of section 30 of the Code, which reads as follows:-
              “30. P ow er to order discovery and the like.- Subject to such
              conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, the court may, at
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                                Page 7 of 10

             any time, either of its own motion or on the application of any
             party,
             (a) make such orders as may be necessary or reasonable in all
             matters relating to the delivery and answering of interrogatories,
             the admission of documents and facts, and the discovery,
             inspection, production, impounding and return of documents or
             other material objects producible as evidence;
             (b) issue summonses to persons whose attendance is required
             either to give evidence or to produce documents or such other
             objects as aforesaid;
             (c) order any fact to be proved by affidavit.”
17)        The above quoted provisions show that power exercisable under
section 30 of the Civil Procedure Code is made “subject to such conditions and
limitations as may be prescribed”. Moreover, sub-section (a) of section 30 of the
Code appears to be relatable to the provisions of Order XIII of the Civil
Procedure Code, which is for “Production, Impounding and Return of
Documents”. The provision of sub-section (b) of section 30 of the Code appears
to be relatable to the provisions of Order XVI of the Code, which is for
“Summoning and Attendance of Witnesses”. The provision of section (c) of
section 30 of the Code appears to be relatable to the provisions of Order Rule (1)
of Order XIX of the Code. The petitioners’ side has not been able to show that
the Court has power to take recourse of the provisions of section 30 of the Code
to overcome the requirement of leave of the Court to admit a document in
evidence as prescribed in Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 14 of Order VII of the Civil
Procedure Code. In the present case in hand, I find that as the suit was in the
stage of evidence of the petitioners- defendants and, as such, the suit had
crossed the stages when provision of section 30 of the Code was exercisable.
Therefore, this is the second reason for not interfering with the orders impugned
herein.
CRP (I/O) 92/2017                                              Page 8 of 10

18)        On re-visiting the said two petitions filed by the petitioners on
02.11.2016 (Annexure-VII), and 06.01.2017 (Annexure-IX), it is observed that
does not contain any statement as to (i) when they applied for certified copies,
(ii) which were the documents in respect of which certified copies were applied.
The provisions of section 85 of the Registration Act, 1908 provides that if any
document other than will is lying unclaimed in any registration office for a period
exceeding two years may be destroyed, therefore, it is prima facie not an
acceptable argument that the original of the registered deeds pertaining to the
year 1970, 1980 and 1985 would still be available in the Office of the Sub-
Registrar, Sadar Joint, Silchar, Cachar, Assam. Hence, in view of the provisions of
section 85 of the Registration Act, 1908, even if one waits for an eternity, there
is dim chance of the original of the purported registered deeds ever reaching the
court for the purpose of adducing evidence thereon. Thus, by accepting the plea
of the petitioners, the suit instituted in the year 2011 shall never come to an end.
Hence, this is the third reason for not granting any relief to the petitioner.
19)        It is also seen that the by order dated 17.09.2016, the learned trial
court had imposed a cost of Rs.500/- making such cost as a condition precedent.
Therefore, such cost, in my view is an order within the meaning of section 35-B
of the Civil Procedure Code. As per the language of Explanation to sub-section
(1) of Section 35-B, payment of cost shall be a condition precedent to the further
prosecution of the defence by such defendants as have been ordered by the
court to pay such cost. The date of 02.11.2016, was the date fixed in the suit,
subsequent to the date of 17.09.2016, when order was passed to pay cost as a
condition precedent, but in the impugned order dated 02.11.2016, there is no
mention that the said cost was paid by the petitioners. Thus, this is the fourth
ground on which I find that the petitioners have foreclosed their right to further
prosecute their defence.

20)        On careful examination of the impugned order, I do not find any
infirmity in the same. Rather, the learned court below has given due regard to
the facts and circumstances under which the said learned court was inclined to
reject the prayer for adjournment.
21)        Moreover, in view of the foregoing discussions, I am of the considered
view that there is no infirmity in the orders dated 02.11.2016 and 07.01.2017,
passed by the learned Munsiff No.1, Cachar, Silchar in T.S. No. 61/2011. The
said learned Court has not committed any jurisdictional error and, as such, no
interference with the said order is warranted. Accordingly, the said order is
upheld. Consequently, this application stands dismissed. The parties are left to
bear their own cost.
22)        The parties are directed to appear before the learned Court of Munsiff
No.1, Cachar, Silchar on 03.07.2017 to seek further instructions from the said
learned Court, without any further notice to appear before the said learned
Court.
                                                                          JUDGE
