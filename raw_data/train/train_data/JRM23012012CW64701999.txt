1.     No one is present on behalf of the petitioner though as
per record, learned counsel for the petitioner, Shri B.K. Paul
has been served.
2.     The petitioner has challenged the order dated 5th
November, 1988 whereby he was removed from service on the
ground that he overstayed his leave with effect from 2nd May,
1988. The petitionerâ€™s case is that he was granted leave from
19th April, 1988 to 1st May, 1988 but he could not resume his
duty on expiry of the leave due to chronic depression and he
sent the intimation of his illness on telephone to the concerned
officers.    The petitioner claims to have reported for duty in
June, 1997 but was not permitted to join.             The petitioner

submitted an appeal dated 2nd July, 1997 which was rejected
on 2nd July, 1998 as time barred.
3.     The respondents in their counter affidavit stated that a
chargesheet was issued to the petitioner on 15th July, 1988
which was duly served on him. Since no reply/response was
received, an enquiry officer was appointed vide order dated
29th July, 1988. The enquiry officer issued the enquiry notice to
the petitioner which was not responded. The petitioner was,
therefore, proceeded ex-parte and the final order imposing
penalty of removal from service was passed on 5th November,
1988. The petitioner did not file any appeal against the said
order to the appellate authority. After a lapse of 9 years, the
petitioner submitted an appeal to the Inspector General, CISF,
Patna which was rejected on 2nd July, 1988 on the ground of
inordinate delay. The respondents also raised the objection of
lack of territorial jurisdiction of this Court as the petitioner was
working at Dhanbad, Bihar and the entire cause of action arose
there. The petitioner has not filed any rejoinder to the counter
affidavit filed as back as on 16th May, 2000.
4.     In the facts and circumstances of this case, there are no
grounds to interfere with the decision of the respondents as
the petitioner has failed to make out any illegality, irregularity,
perversity      or  any   jurisdictional  error   to  warrant     any

interference by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. However, since no one
is present on behalf of the petitioner, this Court is left with no
option but to dismiss the writ petition in default of appearance
of the petitioner and his counsel.
5.     Dismissed in default for non-appearance.
