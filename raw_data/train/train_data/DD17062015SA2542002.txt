_________________________________________________________________
                  This appeal has been filed challenging the judgment and
decree passed by the learned Ad hoc Additional District Judge, Balasore
in Title Appeal No.89/30 of 2001/1999 setting aside the judgment and
decree passed by the learned Additional Civil Judge (Sr. Division),

                                     // 2 //
Balasore in Title Suit No.228 of 1990. The learned Additional Civil Judge
(Sr. Division) had dismissed the suit for partition of properties described
in schedule ‘B’ and ‘C’ of the plaint with allotment of 1/5th share therein
to the plaintiffs and declaring defendant no.1 to be the adopted son of
Jayakrushna Behera and his wife Kshetri. Learned Additional District
Judge in setting aside the judgment and decree impugned in the appeal
has decreed the suit in its entirety allowing all the prayers made therein.
2.           For the sake of convenience, in order to bring clarity and
avoid confusion, the parties hereinafter have been referred to as they have
been arrayed in the court below.

             It is said that the properties are the ancestral properties of
the parties, i.e., the plaintiffs and defendant nos.1 to 11 and they
constitute the undivided Hindu joint family and are governed by

                                    // 3 //
Maitkshara School of Hindu Law. It is averred that the properties are not
partitioned amongst the parties in metes and bounds and that defendant
nos.12 to 20 had purchased a portion of the said properties from the co-
sharers and they have purchased a portion of the undivided homestead
and house described in schedule ‘C’. It is also the case of the plaintiffs
that this Sarat has been adopted by Jayakrushna one of the five sons of
the common ancestor Rama Chandra.
4.            The defendants contested the suit having denied the case of
the adoption of defendant no.1 by Jayakrushna and his wife in the year
1952 as projected by the plaintiffs. However, the dispute was raised with
regard to the claim that the properties were partitioned amongst the co-
sharers. It is also disputed that schedule ‘C’ property is not undivided
homestead and house of the joint family consisting of the plaintiffs and
defendant nos.1 to 11. Their specific case is that the suit properties have
since been partitioned amongst the five sons of Rama Chandra during
their life time on 01.07.1964 under one ‘Panchayat Bantan Patra’, which
of course was not accepted by the settlement authorities and accordingly
the record of right in the Major Settlement remained joint. With all these
they sought to non-suit the plaintiffs.
5.            The trial court framed nine issues. First of all it took up the
issue relating to the adoption and the approach appears to be right. On
analysis of evidence in the touch stone of settled principle of law holding
the filed, the answer has been given against the plaintiffs categorically

                                    // 4 //
holding defendant no.1 as not the adopted son of Jayakrushna and his
wife Kshetri. The lower appellate court has held in the affirmative giving
much emphasis upon Ext.7, the registered deed of acknowledgement of
adoption said to have been executed by Kshetri the widow of Jayakrushna
on 27.04.1980 concerning the said adoption.
6.          The trial court then taking up the other two issues relating to
the partiability of the suit land and the entitlement of the share as
claimed by the plaintiffs over the same rendered conclusive finding that
there had already been previous partition and the question of reopening
the same does not arise. Accordingly, the suit was dismissed.
            The lower appellate court on these issues beginning with
presumption that every Hindu family is presumed to be joint and giving
stress upon the joint record of right published in the year 1987 differed
with the finding of the trial court holding specifically the document
‘Panchayat Bantan Patra’ (Ext.1) to be invalid and          in-genuine. Then
coming to the issue of sale of undivided homestead and house, the lower
appellate court has held the plaintiffs’ entitlement to the right of
premption in repurchasing the schedule ‘C’ property. The following
substantial questions of law have been formulated at the time of
admission of this appeal:
                         “(a) Whether       the finding of the learned
                   lower appellate court    that the adoption as instant
                   one is sustainable in    the absence of any pleading
                   and evidence that no     witness was available at the

                                     // 5 //
                   time of trail of the suit to prove the factum of the
                   adoption?
                          (b)   Whether presumption under section
                   16 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act
                   would be applicable to a document acknowledging
                   previous adoption in addition to the fact that the
                   document was created after the death of adoptive
                   father which was subsequently cancelled and does
                   not contain any recital relating to giving and
                   taking ceremony?
                          (c)   Whether in view of Ext ‘A’ (alleged
                   Panchayat Bantan Patra) which was marked with
                   consent of the parties and the said document not
                   being challenged as sham or nominal, if the
                   learned lower appellate court committed illegality
                   in holding that there was no previous partition?
                          (d)   Whether there is any discrepancies in
                   alleged partition deed relating to allotment and if
                   though not admitting but assuming that there was
                   any such discrepancies, if such discrepancies are
                   sufficient to discard Ext ‘A’ particularly when the
                   aggrieved parties have accepted the possession
                   which does not effect the plaintiff?
7.           Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the finding of
the lower appellate court accepting the case of adoption is wholly contrary
to the settled position of law as also the evidence on record. He contends
that the document of acknowledgement of adoption (Ext.7) has been
unnecessarily given much emphasis upon when there remains no
foundation for such adoption by duly proving the factum of giving and
taking by leading clear, cogent and acceptable evidence. It is also
submitted that even accepting for a moment that Ext.7 is a genuine
document, from the same the factum of giving and taking cannot be
presumed. It is his further contention that the oral evidence on the score
of giving and taking once having been tendered by the plaintiffs, in

                                      // 6 //
support of his case of adoption, the lower appellate court grossly erred in
law by banking upon the theory of ancient adoption in appreciating the
evidence to conclude about adoption wholly losing sight of the settled
principles of law for attraction of such theory to the instant case.
8.           Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand,
supports the finding of the lower appellate court in favour of adoption.
According to him, it is based on correct approach as per law to the subject
and thus is in consonance with the settled position of law.
9.           In order to address the above submission as to whether the
divergent finding rendered by the lower appellate court is to stand or not,
it would be proper to identify the reasons given by the trial court as well
as the lower appellate court in support of their respective findings. But
before that the settled law on the subject needs to be kept in mind.
             The law is fairly settled that the evidence in support of an
adoption must be wholly sufficient to satisfy the very grave and serious
onus that rests upon any person who seeks to displace the natural line of
succession by alleging an adoption. The fact of adoption must be proved
in the same way as any other fact, but where there is a lapse of long
period between the date of adoption and the time when it is being
questioned, every allowance for the absence of evidence to prove such fact
must be favourably entertained, as after the lapse of a long period, direct
evidence to prove adoption may not be available.

                                     // 7 //
10.         The Supreme Court in the case of L. Debi Prasad V. Smt.
Tribeni Devi; AIR 1970 SC 1268 observed:-
                   “In the case of all ancient transactions, it is but
         natural that positive oral evidence will be lacking.
         Passage of time gradually wipes out such evidence.
         Human affairs often have to be judged on the basis of
         probabilities.     Rendering      of   justice   will  become
         impossible if a particular mode of proof is insisted upon
         under    all   circumstances.       In  judging   whether   an
         adoption pleaded has been satisfactorily proved or not,
         we have to bear in mind the lapse of time between the
         date of the alleged adoption and the date on which the
         concerned party is required to adduce proof. In the case
         of an adoption said to have taken place years before the
         same is questioned, the most important evidence is
         likely to be that the alleged adoptive father held out the
         person claiming to have been adopted as his son; the
         latter treated the former as his father and their relations
         and friends treated them as father and son. There is no
         predetermined way of proving any fact. A fact is said to
         have been proved where after considering the matters
         before it, the Court either            believes it to exist or
         considers it existence so probable that a prudent man
         ought, under the circumstances of the particular case,
         to act upon the supposition that it exists. Hence, if after
         taking an overall view of the evidence adduced into the
         case, we are satisfied that the adoption pleaded is true,
         we must necessarily proceed              on the basis, in the
         absence of any       evidence to the contrary, that it is a
         valid adoption as well”.

                                       // 8 //
               The aforesaid view of the Supreme Court has been followed in
a number of cases of this Court and the other High Courts. The aforesaid
principle only regulates the mode of proof of the factum of adoption.
                In the decision in the case of Sri Kanchumarthi Venkata
Seetharama Chandra Row V. Kanchumarthi Raju; AIR 1925 PC 201,
which has been approved          by the Supreme Court in case of Venkata
Ramarao V. Kesaparagada Bhasararao; AIR 1969 SC 1359, it has
been authoritatively held therein that in the case of an ancient adoption,
it stands to reason that after a very long term of years and a variety of
transactions of open life and conduct upon the footing that the adoption
was a valid act, the burden must rest heavily upon him who challenges
its validity.
11.            At this juncture, it is profitable to place some more
authorities in support of the submission of the learned counsel for the
respondents that          the adoption being an ancient one, the burden of
proving giving and taking ceremony on the party who claims that there
was valid adoption is discharged and shifts to the party who challenges it
by proving that there was no valid adoption. In case of Rup Narain V.
Mussammat Gopal Devi (1909) 36 Ind App 103, It was indicated:-
                   “.... The adoption, if it took place, was about
           fifty years ago, so that direct evidence of much value
           could hardly be looked for.
                   Their Lordships are of opinion that the adoption
           is established. Before the death of Sultan in 1861

                                    // 9 //
          Wazir is described as his adopted son. On the death
          of Sultan, Wazir succeeded to the estate without
          controversy which he could only have done as
          adopted son and enjoyed it, and disposed of it as his
          own without controversy down to his death in about
          1870. Almost every document, both during the life of
          Wazir and since his death, is framed entirely upon the
          basis of adoption.”
             It is worthwhile to note that in the said case the Court took
into account that on account of      the fact  that fifty years had elapsed
direct evidence of much value could hardly be looked for and then it
considered the circumstance      that during the lifetime    of the adoptive
father and after his death till the death of the adopted son, the adopted
son has been treated and has behaved as the only heir of the adoptive
father and dealt with the properties of the adoptive     father without any
controversy.
12.          In the case of Vothoba Bhanji V. Vithal Sakroo; AIR 1958
Bom. 270, adoption was being challenged after forty years and in that
setting, the Court held that the fact that since 1913      the adopted son
has throughout described himself and acted as an adopted son and was
so accepted by various persons including the creditors and persons who
took   transfers of immovable property      from him, was of considerable
property from him, was of considerable importance and relevant to show
that he was being regarded by everyone connected with him in business
or otherwise as the adopted son. Those documents had been brushed

                                     // 10 //
aside by the trial court, but the High Court held that the documents were
relevant in considering the question of adoption especially in a case where
the adoption was being challenged after lapse of thirty years and having
regard to the fact that considerable evidence must have disappeared
during that time.
             This decision is, therefore, not a direct authority in support of
contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that simply because
of the case that the adoption is an old one just looking to the lapse of
time, the court can hold that the onus of disproving the fact of adoption
who challenges it. All the above evidence stretching over the period are to
be placed and accepted.
13.          In the case of Harihar Rajguru Mohapatra V. Nabakishore
Rajaguru Mohapatra; AIR 1963 Orissa 45, a Bench of this Court was
considering the applicability of sections 101 to 104 of the Evidence Act
and in that connection it was held ( para-12):-
                  “……..The law is well settled that the evidence in
           support of adoption must be sufficient to satisfy the very
           grave and serious onus that rests upon any person who
           seeks to displace the natural succession by alleging
           adoption. It is equally well settled that when there is a
           long lapse of years between the adoption, for the absence
           of such evidence to prove such fact must be favourably
           entertained, the reason being that after very long term of
           years, it is difficult to procure evidence. Admittedly, in
           this case there is no oral evidence of giving and taking. It

                                   // 11 //
           is not also possible to procure such evidence after this
           long lapse of years. But evidence is available that
           Gopinath was being treated as the adopted son and this
           is apparent from Exts.5, 5/a of the year 1906, Exts. 6,
           6/a of the year 1926 and Ext.3 of the year, 1951. So
           there is a long variety of transactions upon the footing
           that the adoption of Gopinath to Dasarathi was a valid
           act. In such circumstances, the burden rests very heavily
           upon defendant 5 who challenges its validity”.
             It may be noted that in the aforesaid decision, the Court took
into consideration that there was no oral evidence of giving and taking
and further was not possible to procure such evidence after the long lapse
of years. But where the evidence discloses that witnesses are available to
prove giving and taking, the ratio of the aforesaid case, in my considered
opinion, will not be applicable.
14.          In the case of Smt. Pentapati Venkataraman V. Karri
Venkatanarasayamma; AIR 1964 Andhra Pradesh 109, a Bench of
Andhra Pradesh High Court was considering the case of an old adoption.
In that case, the adoption was being challenged after lapse of more than
forty years. There was also direct evidence of D.W.12 who was about 80
years old on the date when she gave evidence and stated on oath that the
adoption took place in accordance with the ceremony of giving and taking
and she had witnessed the same being invited to the ceremony. The trial

                                      // 12 //
court as well as the High Court had accepted the said evidence and came
to hold in favour of adoption.
15.          In the case of Gouranga Sahu V. Bhaga Sahu; AIR 1976
Orissa 43, S.K. Ray, J (as he then was) was considering the case of an old
adoption and also the burden of proof and the mode of appreciation of
evidence thereto. In paragraph 6 of the judgment, his lordship held:-
                 “....So, even though the normal rule is     that one
          who    seeks to deflect the natural line of succession to
          property by alleging adoption must discharge that heavy
          burden, in cases of ancient adoption every allowance for
          the absence       of evidence to prove   such fact must be
          favourably entertained. Where there       is a long lapse of
          years between the adoption and the time when it is being
          questioned and during that period of interregnum a
          variety of transactions of open life and conduct upon
          the footing that the adoption was a valid act have taken
          place, the initial burden necessarily shifts to the person
          who challenges its validity......”
             After applying the law laid down as above to the facts of that
case, his Lordship held;-
                     “.... Considering the entire evidence on record,
             both documentary and oral, and the variety of
             transactions of open life and conduct upon the footing
             of adoption coupled with the weakness of the defence
             evidence, and absence of any caste-man or relative
             coming forward in support of the defence case, it is
             impossible to say that the plaintiff is the adopted son
             of Mohana is erroneous....”

                                   // 13 //
            From the said judgment, it is not quite clear as to what was
the evidence which His Lordship has considered in coming to the
aforesaid conclusion.
16.         A conspectus of the aforesaid authorities unequivocally lays
down rule that a person who claims title on the basis of adoption must
prove the adoption and it has to be established that the essential
ceremony of giving and taking did take place. That burden however, shifts
to the person who challenges the adoption to disprove the adoption when
on account of long lapse of years, direct evidence     of giving and taking
has disappeared, but there remains the evidence of varieties of
transactions in open life and conduct upon the footing of adoption, the
acceptance as such for all these years and other events happening in
normal course of life. But if direct evidence is available or it somehow
even comes out during trial and shown, then the burden would not shift
and the person who claims title on the basis of adoption must discharge
that hearing burden.
17.         The method of appreciation of evidence regarding an old
adoption, however, is not that strict as in the case of a recent origin. The
Privy Council in the case of Tammanna Shivppa Kori V.              Parappa
Girimallappa Kori; AIR 1945 PC 111, affirmed the judgment of the High
Court. In that case, the trial court had disbelieved the evidence of
adoption    on the ground   that it was discrepant in many materials. The

                                     // 14 //
High Court had reversed that             judgment. The Privy Council while
affirming the judgment of the High Court observed as follows:-
                    “......  They    (discrepancies)    were    mainly
             discrepancies to the respective positions occupied by
             the parties and witnesses during the ceremony in the
             house where it took place; but all the witnesses agreed
             as to the vital facts necessary to establish an adoption.
                    .... Their Lordships agreed with the learned
             judges of the High Court in thinking that in the
             circumstances there was not sufficient ground for
             rejecting the evidence in support of the adoption
             ceremony, and that the discrepancies in such evidence
             can be explained by the length of time which had
             elapsed between the ceremony and the date when the
             witnesses were called upon to give evidence........”
18.          It is the settled position of law that mere creation of
document in support of prior adoption cannot be the substitute of the
actual evidence of giving and taking with regard the alleged adoption.
Onus lies on the person who claims adoption to prove the same by leading
clear, cogent and acceptable evidence with regard to the factum of giving
and taking ceremony. This onus resting on that party is required to be
discharged independently of any document. In the absence of evidence of
actual giving and taking of the child even the presumption arising out of a
registered document acknowledging the factum of adoption said to have
taken place at any anterior date without detail recitals regarding giving

                                    // 15 //
and taking of the child is not enough to hold in favour of adoption. In fact
in the absence of such recital on the vital aspect of adoption and upon
which it is founded in that document, the same in my considered view
can neither be said to be a deed falling within the purview of section 16 of
the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act. What is acknowledged after is
adoption and the adoption when is said to be by giving and taking, it has
to find indicated clearly in the document.
19.          Plaintiff No.2 have been examined as P.W.1 and one P.W.2 to
prove the adoption of defendant No.1 by late Jayakrushna and Kshetri.
Plaintiff No.2 being examined as P.W. 1 has stated           that his brother
defendant No.1 was born in 1952 and on his 21st day of birth function
being held in the house during then          their natural parents gave away
defendant No.1 to Jayakrushna and his wife who accepted by taking him
their adopted son. His evidence is that he was born in the year, 1949 and
passed matriculation in the year, 1968. Thus he is being a boy of the age
of about 3 years coming to depose about factum of giving and taking of
defendant No.1 by his natural parents to the adopted parents can is not
believable when it is extremely unnatural that a boy of that age seeing the
same would be remembering to depose it after such a long lapse of time in
a suit of the year, 1990 and that too in the year 1998. This does not stand
for acceptance.     Next evidence is that       of P.W.2 who claims to have
accompanied his father to the house of Jayakrushna on that day when
the function was being held and that was the function of ‘Namakarana’ of

                                     // 16 //
defendant No.1. From the beginning his evidence as it stand, if accepted
gets a jolt that as per his version, he had not gone to attend the function
of adoption but one which is usually held on the 21st day of birth of a
child. So on that day suddenly the ceremony of adoption would be taking
place after calling others for Namakaran ceremony appears to be quite
doubtful. He also states to have seen the giving and taking. The witness
further states to have been born in the year, 1948. That shows he is the
deposing about the fact which he claims to have seen when he was aged
about 4 years. The same criticism remains with regard to remembrance of
all these things by a child of 4 years so as to depose in the year, 1998,
when also this P.W. 2 is not able to state the age of Sachidananda and
Jayakrushna at that time.          His further evidence on oath is most
interesting to be taken note of that P.W.1 was aged about 2 to 3 years by
then.
              So here is a case where the plaintiffs have led direct evidence
for proving the factum of giving and taking. Thus they do not come
forward that      it being an ancient adoption no such direct evidence is
available to be given to prove the fact of giving and taking and despite of
possible efforts they could not search out the same and therefore they are
relying simply on the conduct of the parties, the relationship, the
acceptance of the boy in the society as well as by the relation, open life
transactions if any etc by leading evidence on those scores. The lower
appellate court thus is found to have committed error of law by terming it

                                   // 17 //
to be an ancient adoption in applying the principle of appreciation of
evidence as in case of an ancient adoption. It has also erred by stating
that it being an ancient adoption actual evidence of giving and taking may
not be available. By doing so the lower appellate court has not gone to
explain away the unbelievable evidence which is not permissible. The
party having led the evidence and that being wholly unacceptable, it’s no
more the duty of the court to find out explanation. So, the approach of the
lower court is wholly faulty and not in consonance with law.
20.          At this stage there arises the consideration as regards the
weightage that the document. Ext.7 which is a registered deed of
acknowledgement of adoption indicating therein that there was adoption
of defendant no. 1 would carry. Sec.16 of Hindu Adoptions and
Maintenance Act reads that whenever any document registered under any
law for the time being in force is produced before any court to record an
adoption made and is signed by the person giving the person and taking
the child in adoption, the court shall presume that the adoption has been
made in compliance with the provisions of the Act unless and until it is
disproved. Admittedly, Jayakrushna was not alive when Ext.7 come into
being. Similarly Sachidananda the natural father of defendant No.1 is not
a party and; being not a signatory as an executants to the of said
document. However, he has accorded his approval with necessary
endorsement and signature with regard to the fact of adoption of
defendant No.1. To this of course no exception can be taken since the law

                                     // 18 //
is clear that he must be a signatory in the document. So natural father of
defendant No.1 namely, Sachidananda having put his signature on Ext.7,
it’s sufficient compliance of the provision of Sec. 16 of the Act. But the
whole question is that this Ext.7 does not find mention about the factum
of giving of Defendant No.1 for adoption by his natural parents and taking
in adoption by adoptive parents. It is also not indicated that on the 21st
day birth of defendant No.1 such adoption was made nor even any date of
adoption is stated therein. These being important facts of adoption are
absent in the document which is a deed of acknowledge of adoption. The
details of adoption with reference to the date is required to be indicated
and also the giving and taking which is actually acknowledged by the
parties to the document. So simply stating that defendant No.1 is the
adopted son is not going to serve any purpose. These aspects appear to
have been completely kept aside by the lower appellate court. So when
there is no acceptable evidence with regard to the giving and taking to
prove adoption and the plaintiffs have thus failed to discharge the burden
of prove on that count, the document Ext. 7 simply finding the description
of defendant No.1 as the adopted son of Jayakrushna and the other two
Ext.8 and Ext. 9, two sale deeds are not sufficient to hold that the
plaintiffs have discharged the heavy burden of proof. Ext.11 the voter list
is practically of no such significance when there remains no evidence in
the light of the provisions of section 50 and Sec. 60 of the Evidence Act. It
is also seen that plaintiffs have not laid any evidence in that light also. In

                                      // 19 //
case of Dolagobinda Paricha Vrs. Nimai Charan Misra and others,
AIR 1959 SC 914 the scope and applicability of Section 50 and 60 of the
Evidence Act have been clearly stated. “ It has been stated that if a person
fulfils the conditions laid down in the latter part of Sec. 50 i.e. if he is a
person who as a member of the family or otherwise has special means of
knowledge on the particular subject of relationship, then what is relevant
is his opinion expressed by conduct. 'Opinion' means something more
than a mere retailing of gossip or of hearsay; it means judgment or belief,
i.e. a belief or a conviction resulting from what one thinks on a particular
question. The belief of conviction may manifest itself in conduct or
behaviour which indicates the existence of the belief or the opinion. What
the section says is that such conduct or outward behaviour as evidence of
the opinion held is relevant and, may, therefore, be proved. The conduct
or outward behaviour must be proved in the manner laid down in section
60 of the Evidence Act. The conduct must be of the person who fulfils the
essential conditions of Sec.50”.
               Applying the above,      when the evidence of the witnesses
examined on behalf of the plaintiffs are examined, it is found that those
do not satisfy the tests so as to be held in favour of plaintiffs that the
burden of proving the factum of adoption has been duly discharged.
21.            For the aforesaid discussion, the finding of the lower
appellate court that the defendant no.1 is the adopted son of
Jayakrushna and Kshetri is held to be based on perverse appreciation of

                                    // 20 //
evidence being the outcome of a faulty approach made from the beginning
which does not have the sanction of law. The aforesaid thus leads this
Court to affirm the finding of the trial court that the defendant no.1 is not
the adopted son of Jayakrushna and Kshetri and that the plaintiff has
utterly failed to discharge the onus in proving the same by leading
satisfactory evidence for the Court to accept such a plea.
22.          This takes us to the next question with regard to the issue of
previous partition. It is again the submission of the learned counsel for
the appellants that such a finding that there was no prior partition as
rendered by the lower appellate court is perverse being based on
erroneous appreciation of evidence on record and also on an erroneous
view point of law. He contends that the finding of the trial court on the
score is just and proper.
23.          Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand,
contends that the error of law committed by the trial court has rather
been rectified by the lower appellate court by since it was so rendered by
the trial court ignoring the documents (Exts.A and B) for the purpose of
arriving at a conclusion that there has been prior partition.
             It is the settled position of law that there remains a
presumption that a Hindu family remains joint till the contrary is proved.
The parties may remain separate for the purpose of convenience but that
itself cannot be equated with a case of partition between the parties in
metes and bounds. In the case in hand, the defendants have taken the

                                   // 21 //
plea that there was previous partition amongst five sons of Rama
Chandra. So, rightly the burden of proof is placed on them to establish,
more so on the face of the joint recording of the land in Major Settlement
records.   The   defendants   have    projected  the  document   (Ext.  A)
nomenclatured as Panchayat Bantan Patra dated 15.01.1964 showing
separate allotment of joint family properties in favour of the parties
thereto. This has been given maximum importance by the trial court and
taken together with the admission of the plaintiff no.2 with regard to the
execution of Bantan Patra when that very document has been proved
through the plaintiff’s witness P.W.2, who has gone to prove the signature
of four other brothers, the trial court has held that there was prior
partition accordingly. The plaintiffs in their plaint have denied the
partition in presence of Bhadra Lokas as on 16.01.1964. However that
has been indicated in the sale deeds in favour of defendant nos.12 to 19.
Now on the face of above discussed evidence, the lower appellate court
without assigning any reason as to whether those are sustainable in the
eye of law or not has abruptly jumped to a conclusion that the same has
not been acted upon just because in the Major Settlement record of right
joint recording stands and that has been wholly banked upon and thus
accepted to discard all other evidence including the evidence of dealings
with the properties since the year 1964 onwards continuously.
             As I find that when the trial court has taken some exception
as the plaintiffs having not pleaded Ext. A to be nominal one, not

                                           // 22 //
intended to act upon or executed with ulterior purpose, taking a cue from
that the lower appellate court has found out the debarment to be there
with the defendants to challenge the said document and for that it has
gone to whittle down all those reasoning’s of the trial court. In order to
give justification, the lower appellate court appears to have made an
attempt by posing some question so as to nullify the effect of Ext. A.
24.                 Thus, I find the findings of the lower appellate court on those
scores to be perverse and it is held without any legal justification, the
findings of the trial court have been set at naught. Therefore, this Court
restores the findings of the trial court and the ultimate result of dismissal
of the suit. The substantial question of law as framed are accordingly
answered.
25.                 In the upshot of the above discussion, the appeal is allowed
and in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case without cost. The
suit of the plaintiffs is hereby dismissed.
                                                    ……………………..
