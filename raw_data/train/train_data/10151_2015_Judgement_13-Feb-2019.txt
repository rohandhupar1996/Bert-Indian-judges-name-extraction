Digitally signed by
ARJUN BISHT
Date: 2019.02.13
12:34:04 IST
Reason:
           Meena Bhaskar, have been filed against the Division
           Bench          judgment   of  the    Kerala High   Court  dated
                                               1

06.02.2015. The writ petition under Article 32 has
been   filed    by   C.    Girija    seeking    direction    to
implement the order passed by the Division Bench of
the   High   Court    and    the   order    of    the   Central
Administrative Tribunal in her favour.
2.   Brief facts necessary to be noted for deciding
these appeals and writ petition are:
     The    Southern      Railway,      Divisional      Office,
Personnel     Branch     issued    a    notification      dated
14.10.1999   for selection      of group     ‘C’ employee    to
Group   ‘B’  within    30%   quota   by   LDCE   in   Personnel
Department.     The    notification     intimated     total   5
vacancies (4 unreserved and 1 SC) to be filled up by
limited   competitive     Departmental     examination    under
30%    quota.    Smt.     C.Girija     working     as    Office
Superintendent     Grade   I,   Personal    Branch,    Southern
Railway    submitted     her   candidature     as   unreserved
category candidate. Smt. Meena Bhaskar also submitted
her   candidature     as   reserved    (SC)    candidate.    On
09.01.2001 after written test and viva voce a select
panel   was   issued    which   did   not   include    name  of
C.Girija against 4 unreserved posts. Name of Meena
                               2

Bhaskar was shown as selected candidate against one
SC post. According to her marks C.Girija was placed
at  the   panel   as    fifth   candidate    in   unreserved
category. Promotion orders were issued on 09.01.2001,
candidates those included in the panel were promoted
as Assistant Personal Officer. Panel for 70% quota
was  subsequently    prepared    and  was   also  issued  on
10.04.2001. Under 70% quota there were 13 vacancies
(10 unreserved, 2 SC, 1 ST) for selection to the post
of Assistant Personal Officer. The vacancies relate
to period from 01.10.1996 to 30.09.1998. Thus, total
vacancies, 18 were bifurcated into 30% and 70% quota.
The  panel   issued    for   70%   quota   was   revised  on
20.06.2007, by including additional 2 SC employees
and   excluding    two    junior    unreserved    employees.
Subsequently,   on  05.09.2007     panel  dated   20.06.2007
was again revised adjusting two unreserved employees.
The applicant C.Girija submitted a representation to
the General Manager, Southern Railway, Chennai dated
25.09.2007 requesting for her inclusion and promotion
against the post of APO against 30% quota in the
panel drawn on 09.01.2001. In her representation the
                              3

applicant referred to revision of the panel of 70%
quota by order dated 20.06.2007 and 05.09.2007. The
applicant    in  her   representation     also  stated   that
reserving   one   post   for  SC,   against   30%  quota  was
against the norms. The representation submitted by
the  applicant dated      25.09.2007 was     replied by   the
General   Manager   vide   letter    dated  27.12.2007.   The
General Manager in his reply stated that the orders
issued by the Railways on 20.06.2007 and 05.09.2007
were relating to 70% quota with which applicant has
no concern. With regard to 5 posts under 30% quota it
was stated that selection was finalised on 09.01.2001
as   per   the  reservation      rules   prevalent    at  the
relevant    time.   The    appellant     aggrieved    by  the
communication dated 27.12.2007 filed O.A. No.466 of
2009   before   the    Central    Administrative    Tribunal,
Ernakulam in which the applicant Smt. Meena Bhaskar,
the selected candidate was impleaded as respondent
No.9. Before the Tribunal the respondents filed their
reply. The Tribunal after considering the material on
record disposed of the matter vide its judgment and
order dated 09.11.2011. There was a delay of 560 days
                               4

in filing the O.A., the Tribunal condoned the delay
and decided the O.A. by passing the following order
in paragraphs 11 & 12:
     “11.    Annexure A-I dated 27.12.2007 is
     quashed. The respondents are directed to
     include the applicant in Annexure A-2 panel
     on the basis of her qualifying marks and to
     promote her notionally with effect from the
     date the 9th respondent has been promoted to
     the post of Assistant Personnel Officer.
     The applicant should be placed above the 9th
     respondent in the seniority list of APO for
     the year 2001. The applicant should be
     given regular posting as APO within a
     period of 60 days from the date of receipt
     of a copy of this order. The 9th respondent
     who will be displaced from the Annexure A-2
     panel   should   be   adjusted   against  any
     vacancy that arose subsequent to Annexure
     A-2. The period from the date of promotion
     of the respondent No.9 in 2001 to the date
     her adjustment on a regular vacancy should
     be regularised and appropriate orders in
     this regard also should be issued within
     the time stipulated above.
     12. No order as to costs.”
3.  Against the order of the Tribunal, 9th Respondent,
Meena Bhaskar filed Original Petition before the High
Court of Kerala being O.P. (CAT) No.82 of 2012. The
Union of India also filed O.P.(CAT) No.925 of 2012
before  the  High   Court.  The  High  Court  vide its
judgment dated 03.04.2012 remanded the matter to the
                            5

Tribunal  for  fresh  consideration   of  the  relevant
issues. Against the judgment of the High Court, the
applicant C.Girija filed C.A.Nos.7181-82 of 2014 in
this Court. This Court set aside the judgment of the
High Court and remanded the matter to the High Court
for  determination of   the controversy  on merits   in
accordance with law. In pursuance of the judgment of
this Court dated 04.08.2014, the High Court heard the
parties and by judgment dated 06.02.2015 upheld the
order  of  the  Tribunal  and  dismissed  the  Original
Petitions filed by the Union of India as well as
Meena Bhaskar, the 9th Respondent. Aggrieved by the
judgment of the High Court dated 06.02.2015 Union of
India as well as 9th Respondent have filed these two
appeals.   The  parties   shall  be   referred   to  as
described before the Tribunal.
4.  Writ Petition No.653 of 2015 has been filed by
the applicant C. Girija under Article 32 praying for
direction to the respondent to fix the pay of the
petitioner as per the direction of the Tribunal dated
09.11.2014 as upheld by the High Court. The applicant
in writ petition has also claimed for a direction
                           6

directing    the  respondent   to pay  her   full  retiral
benefits   along with    interest since   she retired   on
31st May, 2015.
5.   Shri   K.M.   Nataraj,  learned  ASG  appearing   for
Union of India submitted that the claim of applicant
of inclusion in the Panel declared on 09.01.2001 was
barred by laches and delay.       The Tribunal and High
Court committed error in entertaining the claim of
the applicant and issuing direction for inclusion in
panel.   It is submitted that cause of action arose to
applicant when the notification dated 14.10.1999 was
issued earmarking 05 vacancies under 30% LDCE quota,
out of which 04 were unreserved and 01 was reserved.
The applicant participated in the selection without
raising any objection and it was only after more than
06 years, she filed a representation on 25.09.2007.
By filing of the representation after more than 06
years, delay and laches cannot be condoned.       The mere
fact   that     the   representation   was    replied   on
27.12.2007 shall not give any fresh cause of action
to the applicant.
                             7

6.  Learned    ASG   submits   that  the    applicant   having
participated without raising any objection regarding
allocation of 01 vacancy to SC candidate, it was not
open for her to challenge the same after such long
delay.   Learned ASG further submitted that even on
merits, the case of the applicant has no legs to
stand.  It is submitted that the cadre strength being
total 37, the total of existing vacancies, vacancies
likely to arise within two years as well as 30% as
construction reserve, total vacancies were calculated
as  18  and   out   of   18,  13   were   allocated    to  70%
selection   and    05   were   allocated     to  30%   Limited
Departmental Competitive Examination (LDCE).            Out of
05,  although    initially    under   calculation     05  were
shown to be allocated to general category but after
objection   by   Nodal   Officer,   who   was   entrusted   to
implement   the   reservation,    the    05   vacancies   were
bifurcated into 04 unreserved and 01 reserved, which
was approved by General Manager.          Consequently, the
notification was issued on 14.10.1999 providing for
01 SC and 04 unreserved category vacancies.
7.  Learned     counsel    appearing    for    the   applicant
                               8

refuting the submission of the learned ASG submits
that there was no delay and laches on the part of the
applicant.     Applicant’s    husband   has   sent   several
representations right from 2002.       The applicant came
to know about several facts regarding irregularities
in selection when the matter was being investigated
by  CBI.   The   applicant   when   came   to   know   about
relevant    facts,    she    filed    representation      on
25.09.2007.    The Tribunal had condoned the delay of
560  days   and   allowed  the   O.A.   on  merits,    hence
question of delay cannot be pressed in service.           It
is further submitted that under 30% LDCE quota, two
SC category candidates were already in place namely,
Shri A. Balachander and Shri J. Senguttuvan, hence no
vacancy should have been allocated to SC quota under
30% selection notified on 14.10.1999. He submits that
there  was ample    material before    the Tribunal     that
above   two   SC   category   candidates    being    already
working under 30% under SC quota, no vacancy should
have been allocated to 30% LDCE.       He submits that in
spite of direction of the Tribunal and High Court,
applicant never got promotion nor benefit of any pay
                             9

fixation.       Applicant     retired    on   31.05.2015.
Consequently, she had to file a Writ Petition No. 653
of  2015   seeking  a  direction    to  compute  all  her
benefits of promotion and all retiral benefits on the
promoted post.
8.   Learned counsel appearing for the 9th respondent
adopts the submission made by learned ASG. Refuting
the submission of the learned counsel appearing for
the applicant it is submitted that the case of the
applicant was highly delayed.      Cause of action arose
to the applicant on 14.10.1999 and 09.01.2001 and the
representation was submitted by her after more than
06 years and by mere reply of the representation will
not give fresh cause of action to the applicant to
rake  up  the  matter  before   the   Tribunal.   In  the
Tribunal and the High Court, the plea of delay and
laches was pressed but both ignored the laches on the
part of the applicant.     On account of the promotion
granted to the 9th respondent on 09.01.2001, the 9th
respondent was entitled to sit back.        The promotion
having not been challenged within reasonable time,
the promotion granted to the 9th respondent cannot be
                            10

adversely  affected  after  such   a  long  delay.   The
findings recorded by the Tribunal and High Court on
the  question of   allocation of    vacancies were  also
perverse.
9.  Learned counsel for the parties in support of
their respective submissions have relied on various
judgments of this Court, which shall be referred to
while considering the submissions in detail.
10. From the submissions of the learned counsel of
the parties and materials on record, following two
issues arise for consideration:-
    (i)    Whether the claim of the applicant to be
           included in the Panel dated 09.01.2001 for
           promotion as APO was barred by delay and
           laches?
    (ii)   Whether under 30% quota of LDCE, all the 05
           vacancies    ought   to    have   been   made
           unreserved     and     notification     dated
           14.10.1999 making 04 vacancies unreserved
           and 01 vacancy reserved for SC was illegal?
                           11

Issue No.1
11. There is no dispute between the parties that in
the    notification      dated       14.10.1999      inviting
applications for filling up of 05 posts under 30%
LDCE quota, 04 vacancies were shown as unreserved and
01 as reserved for SC. The applicant submitted an
application for participation in the selection but
she  could   not   be  included     against   04   unreserved
vacancies,    she being a general category candidate.
There   were    certain    complaints     with    regard    to
selection  under    70%  quota,     with   regard   to   which
certain investigations were going on, which could be
finalized  in   2007.    Applicant     for  the   first   time
submitted representation to General Manager, Southern
Railways on 25.09.2007 praying for inclusion of her
name in the panel dated 09.01.2001.             Copy of the
representation    filed    by    the  applicant     has   been
brought on the record, which indicate that applicant
has in her representation relied on certain orders
issued on 20.06.2007 and 05.09.2007 with regard to
revision  of   the   panel   under   70%   selection    quota.
With regard to 30% quota to be filled through LDCE,
                              12

she stated that reserving 01 post for SC was totally
against   all norms.       Representation    was replied    by
Railways on 27.12.2007 stating that with regard to
revision of the panel under 70% promotion quota, the
applicant is not a party in any way. With regard to
vacancy under 30% LDCE selection, it was indicated
that the same was done as per the Rules prevalent at
that time.     O.A. No. 466 of 2009 was filed thereafter
by  the   applicant,     which    has  been  decided   by  the
Tribunal.    Tribunal condoned the delay of 560 days in
filing the O.A.        The applicant has challenged the
communication dated 27.12.2007 of the Railways which
was   given   in  reply    to   the   representation   of  the
applicant.      The   condonation     of  delay,  thus,   only
meant that against the letter dated 27.12.2007, her
O.A. was held to be within time.            The Tribunal and
High   Court   has   not   adverted    to  the  delay,   which
accrued from the declaration of panel on 09.01.2001
and submitting her representation on 25.09.2007, i.e.
after more than 06 years and 09 months.
12. This Court had occasion to consider the question
of   cause   of    action    in    reference   to  grievances
                                13

pertaining to service matters.       This Court in C.Jacob
Vs.  Director  of    Geology    and  Mining   and  Another,
(2008) 10 SCC 115 had occasion to consider the case
where an employee was terminated and after decades,
he filed a representation, which was decided.         After
decision of the representation, he filed an O.A. in
the  Tribunal, which    was entertained     and order   was
passed.   In the above context, in paragraph No.9,
following has been held:-
     “9. The courts/tribunals proceed on the
     assumption, that every citizen deserves a
     reply to his representation. Secondly, they
     assume that a mere direction to consider
     and dispose of the representation does not
     involve   any    “decision”     on   rights   and
     obligations of parties. Little do they
     realise    the    consequences      of   such   a
     direction      to     “consider”.       If    the
     representation is considered and accepted,
     the ex-employee gets a relief, which he
     would not have got on account of the long
     delay, all by reason of the direction to
     “consider”.     If    the    representation    is
     considered and rejected, the ex-employee
     files an application/writ petition, not
     with reference to the original cause of
     action of 1982, but by treating the
     rejection of the representation given in
     2000, as the cause of action. A prayer is
     made   for    quashing      the    rejection   of
     representation and for grant of the relief
     claimed    in     the     representation.     The
     tribunals/High Courts routinely entertain
     such applications/petitions ignoring the
     huge delay preceding the representation,
                             14

     and proceed to examine the claim on merits
     and grant relief. In this manner, the bar
     of    limitation    or     the    laches    gets
     obliterated or ignored.”
13. This Court again in the case of Union of India
and  Others  Vs.  M.K.   Sarkar,    (2010)  2  SCC  59 on
belated representation laid down following, which is
extracted below:-
     “15. When a belated representation in
     regard to a “stale” or “dead” issue/dispute
     is considered and decided, in compliance
     with a direction by the court/tribunal to
     do so, the date of such decision cannot be
     considered as furnishing a fresh cause of
     action for reviving the “dead” issue or
     time-barred     dispute.      The    issue    of
     limitation or delay and laches should be
     considered with reference to the original
     cause of action and not with reference to
     the date on which an order is passed in
     compliance    with    a    court’s    direction.
     Neither a court’s direction to consider a
     representation issued without examining the
     merits, nor a decision given in compliance
     with   such   direction,     will   extend   the
     limitation, or erase the delay and laches.”
14. Again, this Court in State of Uttaranchal and
Another Vs. Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and Others,
(2013) 12 SCC 179 had occasion to consider question
of delay in challenging the promotion.          The Court
further held that representations relating to a stale
                             15

claim or dead grievance does not give rise to a fresh
cause   of  action.      In   Paragraph    Nos.   19  and 23
following was laid down:-
      “19. From the aforesaid authorities it is
      clear as crystal that even if the court or
      tribunal    directs    for    consideration     of
      representations relating to a stale claim
      or dead grievance it does not give rise to
      a fresh cause of action. The dead cause of
      action    cannot     rise   like     a    phoenix.
      Similarly,      a     mere      submission      of
      representation to the competent authority
      does not arrest time.
      23. In State of T.N. v. Seshachalam, (2007)
      10 SCC 137, this Court, testing the
      equality clause on the bedrock of delay and
      laches pertaining to grant of service
      benefit, has ruled thus: (SCC p. 145, para
      16)
            “16. … filing of representations
          alone would not save the period of
          limitation. Delay or laches is a
          relevant factor for a court of law to
          determine the question as to whether
          the claim made by an applicant
          deserves consideration. Delay and/or
          laches on the part of a government
          servant may deprive him of the
          benefit which had been given to
          others.     Article      14     of      the
          Constitution of India would not, in a
          situation     of    that     nature,     be
          attracted as it is well known that
          law leans in favour of those who are
          alert and vigilant.”
15. This Court referring to an earlier judgment in
                              16

P.S. Sadasivaswamy Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, (1975) 1
SCC 152 noticed that a person aggrieved by an order
of promoting a junior over his head should approach
the Court at least within six months or at the most a
year of such promotion.   In Paragraph No. 26 and 28,
following was laid down:-
     “26. Presently, sitting in a time machine,
     we may refer to a two-Judge Bench decision
     in P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of T.N.,
     (1975) 1 SCC 152, wherein it has been laid
     down that: (SCC p. 154, para 2)
        “2. … A person aggrieved by an order
        of promoting a junior over his head
        should approach the Court at least
        within six months or at the most a
        year of such promotion. It is not
        that   there   is     any   period   of
        limitation for the courts to exercise
        their powers under Article 226 nor is
        it that there can never be a case
        where the courts cannot interfere in
        a matter after the passage of a
        certain length of time. But it would
        be a sound and wise exercise of
        discretion for the courts to refuse
        to   exercise    their    extraordinary
        powers under Article 226 in the case
        of persons who do not approach it
        expeditiously for relief and who
        stand by and allow things to happen
        and then approach the Court to put
        forward stale claims and try to
        unsettle settled matters.”
     28. Remaining oblivious to the factum of
     delay and laches and granting relief is
     contrary to all settled principles and even
                           17

     would not remotely attract the concept of
     discretion. We may hasten to add that the
     same    may    not    be    applicable    in   all
     circumstances where certain categories of
     fundamental rights are infringed. But, a
     stale claim of getting promotional benefits
     definitely should not have been entertained
     by the Tribunal and accepted by the High
     Court.”
16. On the preposition as noticed above, it is clear
that the claim of the applicant for inclusion of her
name in the panel, which was issued on 09.01.2001 and
for the first time was raked up by her, by filing
representation on 25.09.2007, i.e., after more than
06 and half years. The claim of inclusion in the
panel had become stale by that time and filing of
representation    will   not   give   any   fresh  cause  of
action.    Thus,    mere   fact   that  representation   was
replied  by   Railways    on  27.12.2007,    a  stale  claim
shall not become a live claim.           Both Tribunal and
High Court did not advert to this important aspect of
the  matter.     It is   further to     be noted   from the
material on record that after declaration of panel on
09.01.2001, there were further selection under 30%
promotion   by   LDCE   quota,    in  which   the  applicant
participated.     In   selection     held    in   2005   she
                              18

participated   and  was   declared   unsuccessful.     With
regard   to   her   non-inclusion    in   panel   in   2005
selection, she also filed O.A. No. 629 of 2006 before
the    Tribunal,    which    was    dismissed.        After
participating    in  subsequent    selections   under   30%
quota and being declared unsuccessful, by mere filing
representation on 27.09.2007 with regard to selection
made in 2001, the delay and laches shall not be wiped
out.
17. There is one more aspect of the matter, which
need to be noted.     The applicant was well aware that
under 30% LDCE quota, out of 05 vacancies, 04 are
unreserved and 01 is reserved, which was circulated
by notification dated 14.10.1999. She applied against
the said bifurcated vacancies and was interviewed on
08.01.2001, panel of which was declared on 09.01.2001
and promotion was made on the same day. She having
participated in the selection for promotion under 30%
LDCE quota and the bifurcation of the vacancies being
part of the process of selection, it was not open for
her to challenge the bifurcation of vacancies into
general and reserved after taking a chance to get
                             19

selected.    In   this context,   reference  is  made  to
judgment of this Court in Ashok Kumar and Another Vs.
State of Bihar and Others, (2017) 4 SCC 357.         This
Court after referring to several earlier judgments
have laid down following in Paragraph Nos. 13 to 18:-
     “13. The law on the subject has been
     crystallised in several decisions of this
     Court.    In   Chandra    Prakash   Tiwari   v.
     Shakuntala Shukla, (2002) 6 SCC 127, this
     Court laid down the principle that when a
     candidate appears at an examination without
     objection and is subsequently found to be
     not successful, a challenge to the process
     is precluded. The question of entertaining
     a petition challenging an examination would
     not arise where a candidate has appeared
     and    participated.    He    or  she    cannot
     subsequently turn around and contend that
     the process was unfair or that there was a
     lacuna therein, merely because the result
     is not palatable. In Union of India v. S.
     Vinodh Kumar, (2007) 8 SCC 100, this Court
     held that: (SCC p. 107, para 18)
         “18. It is also well settled that
         those candidates who had taken part
         in the selection process knowing
         fully well the procedure laid down
         therein were not entitled to question
         the same. (See Munindra Kumar v.
         Rajiv Govil, (1991) 3 SCC 368 and
         Rashmi Mishra v. M.P. Public Service
         Commission, (2006) 12 SCC 724.)”
     14. The same view was reiterated in Amlan
     Jyoti Borooah, (2009) 3 SCC 227, wherein it
     was held to be well settled that the
     candidates who have taken part in a
     selection process knowing fully well the
                            20

procedure    laid    down   therein    are   not
entitled to question it upon being declared
to be unsuccessful.
15. In Manish Kumar Shahi v. State of
Bihar,   (2010)    12   SCC   576,   the   same
principle was reiterated in the following
observations: (SCC p. 584, para 16)
   “16. We also agree with the High
   Court that after having taken part in
   the process of selection knowing
   fully well that more than 19% marks
   have been earmarked for viva voce
   test, the petitioner is not entitled
   to challenge the criteria or process
   of    selection.     Surely,    if    the
   petitioner’s name had appeared in the
   merit list, he would not have even
   dreamed of challenging the selection.
   The petitioner invoked jurisdiction
   of the High Court under Article 226
   of the Constitution of India only
   after he found that his name does not
   figure in the merit list prepared by
   the Commission. This conduct of the
   petitioner clearly disentitles him
   from questioning the selection and
   the High Court did not commit any
   error by refusing to entertain the
   writ petition. Reference in this
   connection     may   be   made   to   the
   judgments in Madan Lal v. State of
   J&K, (1995) 3 SCC 486, Marripati
   Nagaraja v. State of A.P., (2007) 11
   SCC 522, Dhananjay Malik v. State of
   Uttaranchal, (2008) 4 SCC 171, Amlan
   Jyoti Borooah v. State of Assam,
   (2009) 3 SCC 327 and K.A. Nagamani v.
   Indian Airlines, (2009) 5 SCC 515.”
16. In    Vijendra Kumar Verma v. Public
Service   Commission, (2011) 1 SCC 150,
                       21

candidates who had participated in the
selection process were aware that they were
required   to    possess     certain    specific
qualifications in computer operations. The
appellants had appeared in the selection
process and after participating in the
interview sought to challenge the selection
process as being without jurisdiction. This
was held to be impermissible.
17. In Ramesh Chandra Shah v. Anil Joshi,
(2013) 11 SCC 309, candidates who were
competing for the post of Physiotherapist
in the State of Uttarakhand participated in
a written examination held in pursuance of
an advertisement. This Court held that if
they had cleared the test, the respondents
would not have raised any objection to the
selection process or to the methodology
adopted.   Having     taken     a    chance    of
selection, it was held that the respondents
were disentitled to seek relief under
Article 226 and would be deemed to have
waived   their    right    to    challenge    the
advertisement     or     the     procedure     of
selection. This Court held that: (SCC p.
318, para 18)
   “18. It is settled law that a person
   who consciously takes part in the
   process     of     selection       cannot,
   thereafter, turn around and question
   the method of selection and its
   outcome.”
18. In Chandigarh Admn. v. Jasmine Kaur,
(2014) 10 SCC 521, it was held that a
candidate who takes a calculated risk or
chance by subjecting himself or herself to
the selection process cannot turn around
and complain that the process of selection
was unfair after knowing of his or her non-
selection. In Pradeep Kumar Rai v. Dinesh
Kumar Pandey, (2015) 11 SCC 493, this Court
held that: (SCC p. 500, para 17)
                       22

        “17. Moreover, we would concur with
        the Division Bench on one more point
        that the appellants had participated
        in the process of interview and not
        challenged it till the results were
        declared. There was a gap of almost
        four months between the interview and
        declaration of result. However, the
        appellants did not challenge it at
        that time. This, it appears that only
        when the appellants found themselves
        to be unsuccessful, they challenged
        the    interview.     This   cannot    be
        allowed.     The    candidates     cannot
        approbate and reprobate at the same
        time. Either the candidates should
        not    have     participated    in    the
        interview      and     challenged     the
        procedure     or   they    should    have
        challenged     immediately   after    the
        interviews were conducted.”
     This principle has been reiterated in a
     recent judgment in Madras Institute of
     Development Studies v. K. Sivasubramaniyan,
     (2016) 1 SCC 454”.
18. We, thus, due to the above both the reasons, are
of the view that the Tribunal and the High Court
ought not to have entertained the stale claim of the
applicant.
Issue No.2
19. Issue   No.2   pertains    to  calculation    of the
vacancies.    Before   the Tribunal,   an affidavit  was
                            23

filed   by   Deputy  Chief   Personnel  Officer,   Southern
Railway explaining the determination of vacancies for
selection.      The affidavit is on the record.         The
affidavit indicates that in selection for the period
01.10.1996 to 30.09.1998, total vacancies calculated
were 18, out of which 13 was allocated to 70% regular
selection     and  05   vacancies   to  30%   LDCE   quota.
Initially, the calculation sheet with regard to 30%
LDCE quota shown all 05 vacancies as unreserved but
when Nodal Officer examined the same, he was of the
view that vacancies to be consumed under 30% LDCE
quota should be from point No.10 to 14 and Point No.
14  is   reserved   for   SC.    The  calculation   further
indicates that two SC candidates Shri A. Balachander
and Shri J. Senguttuvan were already working.         Thus,
05 vacancies were to be reserved for SC candidates
out of cadre of 37.      Two SC candidates being already
working    there  was  shortfall   of  03,  for  which   02
vacancies were earmarked under 70% and 01 under 30%.
In this context, reference to Paragraph No. 8 to 12
of the affidavit is relevant, which are as follows:-
      “8. However, the above distribution was made
      as if the roster point accrues from point
                              24

number 9 to 13 of the roster (all these
roster points are UR) for 30% selection.
Whereas the 9th point has already been
consumed by Shri Srinivasa Raghavan who was
selected and empaneled during 1996-97.
Therefore, the actual point to be consumed
should be from Point No.10 to 14 of which
point No. 10 to 13 are UR, and 14 th point
reserved for SC.
9. I submit that as per procedure involved
in the second stage this proposal was put
up to Senior Personnel Officer/Reservation
for his verification on the application of
reservation    rules.        Senior     Personnel
Officer/Reservation      noticed      that    the
accrual of points should be 10 to 14 (14th
point reserved for SC) and not as Point
No.9 to 13 and he amended the proposal
(Annexure-R.10) as under:-
                            TOTAL   UR   SC ST
for      70%       Regular  13@     10   2  1
Selection 18X70
            100
@ as per 40 point roster, the point to be
consumed was No.12 to 24 which includes 25C
(Point No.14 & 22) and 1 ST point (Point
No.17) (Annexure-A.6-page No.34 of the OA)
                            TOTAL   UR   SC ST
for 30% LDCE 18X30          5$      4    1  --
                100
$ as per 40 point roster, the point to be
consumed was No.10 to 14 which includes 1
SC (Point No.14)(Annexure-A.6-page No.32 of
the OA)
    The amended proposal was submitted to
the General Manager through the Chief
Liaison    Officer    viz.    Chief     Personnel
Officer.
                       25

10. I submit that as per the 3 rd stage the
vetted figure as shown below was approved
by the competent authority viz. General
Manager     on     24.10.1996        and      notified
accordingly:
                                TOTAL    UR   SC    ST
for      70%        Regular     13@      10   2     1
Selection 18X70
             100
for 30% LDCE 18X30              5$       4    1     --
                 100
11. I   submit     that    the     requirement         of
reservation in APO cadre was as under:
Cadre     Required           Available Cadre
Strength Reservation                        Shortfall
          SC       ST        SC        ST SC       ST
          (15%) (7.5%)
37        5        3         2         1    3      2
     (Annexure-A.5-page      No.31 of the OA)
    Accordingly,      as    per     requirement        of
reservation in the cadre the distribution
of 18 vacancies among UR/SC/ST would be as
follows:-
      UR       SC         ST       TOTAL
      13        3          2         18
    Further,     the    shortfall        of    SC     was
distributed among 70% and 30% selections as
under by following roster:
                             UR     SC    ST    TOTAL
For     70%      Regular     10      2     1      13

For 30% LDCE                  4      1    --       5
Total                        14      3     1      18
12. I submit that the selection for the post
of Assistant Personnel Officer through 30%
                         26

     Limited        Departmental          Competitive
     Examination is a part of 70% regular
     selection.    Therefore, the assessment of
     vacancies of the 70% regular selection and
     Limited        Departmental          Competitive
     Examination 30% has to be taken for the
     period from 01.10.1996 to 30.09.1998 and
     there is no provision for taking vacancies
     accrued after 01.10.1998.            Though the
     selection   for    the    post    of   Assistant
     Personnel      Officer      through      Limited
     Departmental Competitive Examination held
     during 2001, while regular 70% selection
     held   during    1998,    the    assessment   of
     vacancies is limited up to 30.09.1998 and
     vacancies accrued after 01.10.1998 were
     taken only for subsequent selection.”
20. The Tribunal took the view that there being 02 SC
candidates already available under 30% LDCE quota, no
further vacancy ought to have been allocated under
30% quota for SC.
21. The   Tribunal   and  the    High   Court   both  have
observed that any vacancy coming after the relevant
period  ought   not   to   have    been   taken.     Those
observations were in context of vacancy, which arose
due to promotion of A. Balchandar on 03.01.2001.        In
the affidavit, in Paragraph No. 12, it was clearly
mentioned that assessment of vacancies is limited up
to 30.09.1998 and vacancies accrued after 01.10.1998
                            27

were taken only for subsequent selection.        Thus, it
is clear that in computation for vacancies under 30%,
no vacancy, which had arisen out of relevant period
was taken.    Learned counsel for the applicant has
much emphasized that under 30% both, i.e., Shri A.
Balachander and Shri J. Senguttuvan being available,
there could not have been 01 further vacancy reserved
for Sc.    In this context, Paragraph No. 8 of the
affidavit as noticed above is relevant, where it is
mentioned that the roster point from point number 9
to 13 of the roster was for 30% selection. But 9 th
point having already been consumed by Shri Srinivas
Raghavan, who was selected and empaneled during 1996-
97, therefore, the actual point to be consumed should
be from point No. 10 to 14.        Point No. 14 being
reserved  for  SC, 05   vacancies  but  30%   quota  were
distributed accordingly and out of which 01 vacancy
was  allocated  to  SC.    Thus,  there   was   plausible
explanation for determination of vacancies given by
the Railways.   The explanation with regard to roster
point as given by the Railways has not been adverted
to by High Court or Tribunal.     We, thus, are of the
                           28

view that explanation by the Railway was a plausible
explanation, which was not such as to give a cause
for interference by the Tribunal and the High Court.
Thus, we are of the view that the above ground for
interference as given by the Tribunal and the High
Court is unsustainable.
22. At last, the learned counsel for the applicant
has submitted that although applicant has retired on
31.05.2015 but due to pendency of these litigations,
her retirement benefits have not been finalized. The
applicant having retired on 31.05.2015 there was no
impediment to compute and pay her retirement benefits
without prejudice to the claim of Railways. The delay
in payment of retiral benefits has to be compensated
by directing payment of interest.
23. We  are  thus  of   the    view that   applicant  was
entitled for retiral benefits immediately after the
date of retirement.    We direct Respondent Nos.1 to 4
in Writ Petition (C)No.653 of 2015 to determine and
pay the retirement benefits to the applicant, if not
already  paid,  within   a  period  of   02  months  from
today.   We further direct that applicant should be
                            29

paid interest @ 8% p.a. on retirement benefits after
one month of retirement i.e. w.e.f. 01.07.2015, till
the payment is made of the retiral benefits.       In
result, the Civil Appeal No. 1577 of 2019 and Civil
Appeal No. 1578 of 2019 are allowed and the Writ
Petition (C) No. 653 of 2015 is disposed of with the
aforesaid directions.
