PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
1.    Rule 22 of the Delhi Police (Appointment & Recruitment) Rules,
1980 as originally framed read as under:-
      “Seniority in the case of upper and lower subordinate shall
      be initially reckoned from the date of first appointment, and
      officer of subordinate rank promoted from a lower rank
      being considered senior, to persons appointed direct to the
      same rank on the same day, till seniority is finally settled by
      confirmation. The seniority of direct recruits in all ranks
      except Sub-Inspectors (Ex.) appointed as a result of some
      examination or selection shall be reckoned by the order of
      merit determined.
      By the Selection Board and in case no order of merit is
      indicated by the age of candidates, the oldest being placed
      senior-most and the youngest the junior-most. The inter-
      seniority of directly recruited Sub-Inspectors (Ex.) shall be
      fixed, on the basis of total of marks obtained by them in the
      Staff Selection Commission Examination/Interview as well as
      in the final examination held at Police Training
      School/College.”
2.    The Rule was amended on May 07, 2003, and the amended Rule reads
as under:-
      “Seniority in the rank of upper and lower subordinate shall
      be initially reckoned from the date of first appointment, and
      officer of subordinate rank promoted from a lower rank
      being considered senior to persons appointed direct to the
      same rank on the same day. The seniority of direct recruits in
      all ranks except Sub-Inspectors (Executive) appointed as a
      result of some examination or selection shall be reckoned by
      the order of merit determined by the Selection Board and in
      case no order of merit is indicated, by the age of the
      candidate, the oldest being placed senior-most and the
      youngest the junior-most. The inter-seniority of directly
W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 & conn.matters                                 Page 2 of 7

       recruited Sub-Inspectors (Ex.) shall be fixed, on the basis of
       total of marks obtained by them in the Staff Selection
       Commission Examination/Interview as well as in the final
       examination held at Police Training School/College.”
3.     The Commissioner of Police challenges an order dated May 09, 2001
passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal allowing OA No.1159/1999
directing seniority of the respondents Mukesh Tyagi and Mukesh Kumar to
be fixed as Sub-Inspector as per their merit position and not from the
fortuitous date of confirmation. Raj Kumar Sharma challenges in W.P.(C)
No.2267/2003 a judgment dated November 08, 2002 dismissing Original
Application filed by him on the bar of limitation. On merits, we note that
seniority of Raj Kumar Sharma was fixed with reference to the date of his
confirmation in service. The Commissioner of Police challenges the order
dated August 07, 2001 allowing OA No.2276/2000 filed by the respondent
who was aggrieved by his seniority being fixed vis-a-vis one Janak Raj on
the basis of merit position to the post of HC (MT) and wanted seniority to be
fixed with reference to the date of confirmation.
4.     We find that the reasoning of the Tribunal in the decision challenged
in W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 and W.P.(C) No.958/2002 are at variance.
Whereas one decision holds that the seniority has to be with reference to the
merit position, the other holds that the seniority has to be with reference to
the date of confirmation.
5.     We note that in all three cases the litigating parties were fighting on
the seniority position having joined service as direct recruits.
6.     We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We note that the
Central Administrative Tribunal itself relies on the contradictory view taken
W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 & conn.matters                                  Page 3 of 7

by different Benches of the Tribunal on the subject of inter-se seniority
fixation principle enshrined in Rule 22 of the Delhi Police (Appointment &
Recruitment) Rules, 1980 and in particular the requirement of the Rule that
it would be the date of confirmation which would determine the seniority;
which Rule was amended in the year 2003 and the words that seniority
would be settled with reference to the date of confirmation were deleted.
7.     There existed an OM No.9/11/55-RPS dated December 22, 1959,
issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, on the subject
of the principle to be adopted in determining seniority. Making a reference
to Office Memorandums dated June 22, 1949, February 03, 1950, April 27,
1951 and August 04, 1956, the Office Memorandum dated December 1959
required seniority to be drawn up, in case of posts to be filled up by direct
recruitment, in the order of merit in which candidates were selected, but
subject to a proviso; and since the proviso needs an interpretation as it was
debated upon between learned counsel for the parties, we quote the main
provision along with the proviso; it reads as under:-
       “Notwithstanding the provisions of para 3 above the relative
       seniority of all direct recruits shall be determined by the order
       of merit in which they are selected for such appointment on the
       recommendations of the UPSC or other selecting authority,
       persons appointed as a result of an earlier selection being
       senior to those appointed as a result of subsequent selection;
       Provided that where persons recruited initially on a temporary
       basis are confirmed subsequently in an order different from the
       order of merit indicated at the time of their appointment,
       seniority shall follow the order of confirmation and not the
       original order of merit.”
8.     On July 03, 1986, vide Office Memorandum No.22011/7/86-Estt.(D),
W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 & conn.matters                                  Page 4 of 7

though using a different language on the subject of seniority position, in sum
and substance the same principle of fixation of seniority as was prescribed
by the Office Memorandum dated December 22, 1959 was retained.
9.      But, on May 02, 1990, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
had rendered an opinion reported as AIR 1990 SC 1607             Class II Direct
Recruits Engineering Officers’ Association Vs. State of Maharashtra
resulting in an Office Memorandum No.20011/5/90-Estt.(D), dated
November 04, 1992 being issued, modifying the principle pertaining to
seniority laid down in the Office Memorandum dated December 22, 1959; to
bring the same in conformity with the law declared by the Constitution
Bench of the Supreme Court; but made it clear that seniority already
determined according to the existing principles on the date when seniority
lists were drawn up would not be re-opened. The changed position was to
accord seniority with reference to the order of merit indicated at the time of
initial appointment and not according to the date of confirmation.
10.     Thus, we need not speak any further. The view taken by the Tribunal
in its decision dated May 09, 2001 conforms to the law declared by the
Supreme Court as noted above.
11.     Thus, W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 is dismissed.
12.     As regards W.P.(C) No.2267/2003 we find that though the seniority
list drawn up which was challenged therein wrongly applies the principle of
date of confirmation and not merit position in the select list as the criteria for
determining seniority, but we find that the challenge to the seniority list was
highly belated and thus concur with the Tribunal that the challenge had to
fail, it being settled law that if a seniority list is allowed to operate over a
number of years, the same cannot be undone or set aside. We additionally
W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 & conn.matters                                    Page 5 of 7

note that the writ petitioner has superannuated on April 30, 2011.
Accordingly, we dismiss W.P.(C) No.2267/2003.
13.    The reasoning of the Tribunal in favour of the respondent of W.P.(C)
No.958/2002 quashes a seniority list drawn up with reference to the merit
position in the select panel and directs re-drawing of the seniority on the
principle of date of confirmation being the criteria.
14.    The view taken by the Tribunal is wrong requiring the order dated
August 07, 2001 passed by the Tribunal to be set aside, but issuing further
directions to preserve and protect the interest of the petitioner as also HC
(MT) Janak Raj whose seniority has been disturbed.
15.    For reasons best known to him, Janak Raj did not challenge the
impugned decision. The Commissioner of Police did so by filing the instant
writ petition No.958/2002 but without seeking any stay of the operation of
the impugned decision dated August 07, 2001. This has resulted in the
Department re-drawing the seniority list in which the respondent was shown
senior to Janak Raj resulting in the respondent earning a promotion to the
post of ASI (MT) Fitter Grade I in the year 2012.             Janak Raj earned
promotion to the said post in the year 2013.        Setting aside the impugned
order and restoring status quo ante would mean that respondent’s promotion
in the year 2012 would have to be withdrawn by the Department, but he
would earn a promotion the next year i.e. 2013. It will affect one increment
earned by the respondent.
16.    But, as a result of the seniority list being re-drawn, having worked on
the promotional post since the year 2012, the respondent would be entitled to
an increment the next year i.e. 2013, in which year he would in any case
earn a promotion.
W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 & conn.matters                                   Page 6 of 7

17.   We do not disturb the increment drawn.
18.   Accordingly, we dispose of W.P.(C) No.958/2002 setting aside the
impugned order dated August 07, 2001 but directing that promotion earned
by the respondent would not be disturbed, however with reference to the
seniority to the post of HC (MT) as originally drawn by the Department, the
seniority list of ASI (MT) shall be drawn up treating HC (MT) Janak Raj
senior to the respondent for the reason in the year 2012 it would be HC (MT)
Janak Raj who would have earned the promotion would have earned one in
the year 2013.
19.   To summarize:-
(i)   W.P.(C) No.4287/2002 is dismissed.
(ii)  W.P.(C) No.2267/2003 is dismissed.
(iii) W.P.(C) No.958/2002 is disposed of in terms of paragraph 18 above.
20.   No costs.
