Reason:
           Rs.14 lakhs as compensation along with interest @12% per annum

                                                                    2
w.e.f. 06.09.2011 on the ground that the appellants (builder) had
compromised a similar matter with one Shri P.V. Babu in a civil
suit.   In view of the decision which we propose to take, it is not
necessary to set out the facts of the case in detail.
4.    The main ground raised is that the appellants herein were
wrongly proceeded ex parte and only on this ground the order of the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (‘the National
Commission’ for short) should be set aside and the matter be
remanded to the National Commission to decide the same after
hearing both the sides.
5.    On behalf of the appellants it is urged that the appellants had
received notice dated 08.07.2014 from the National Commission
and, thereafter, they had sent a reply on 25.07.2014 praying that
the matter may be heard in the Camp Sitting of the National
Commission at Bengaluru.       According to the appellants, no reply
was received to this letter. On behalf of the claimants/respondents
it is urged that the appellants were aware of the case and that the
matter had been settled on the basis of a compromise arrived at by
the appellants with another consumer and there is no need to set

                                                                    3
aside the order.   After going through the record we find that the
appellants had made a request that their matter be heard at
Bengaluru. Copies of the orders passed thereafter have been placed
on record and the record does not show that the appellants were
ever informed that their request for having the matter heard at
Bengaluru was either accepted or rejected. Therefore, we are of the
considered opinion that the National Commission erred in not
issuing fresh notice to the appellants. Accordingly, the order of the
National Commission is set aside and the matter is remitted to the
National Commission for hearing the same on merits.
6.   Vide order dated 22.07.2016 while issuing notice we had
directed the appellants to deposit the amount as awarded by the
National Commission. The said amount shall remain in deposit and
disbursal of the same shall abide by the final decision of the
National Commission.
7.   The parties are directed to appear before the National
Commission at Delhi on 12th February, 2018.

                                                                   4
8.   With these directions the appeals stand disposed of. Pending
applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
