                       Criminal Petition No. 496 of 2010
                                           BEFORE
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
            Heard Mr. Abdur Razzaque Bhuyan, learned counsel for the petitioner and
    Mr. B.B. Gogoi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State, the Respondent
    No.1 as well as Respondent No. 2, learned CJM, Hailakandi.
    2.      On 09.10.2010, the petitioner lodged an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of
    Algapur Police Station alleging that on 09.10.2010 around 03:30 am, a group of 17
    to 18 unknown persons, unauthorisedly entered their house, introducing
    themselves to be army personnel, forcibly took away her husband Iqbal Hussain
    Laskar, tortured him mercilessly and, thereafter, they kidnapped her husband to an
    unknown place. She in her FIR also stated that later could come to know that her
    husband was taken to Manipur Army Camp where he was tortured brutally and
    killed him and, therefore, prayed before the authority to take appropriate actions.
    The said FIR of the petitioner was duly received by the Officer-in-Charge of
    Algapur Police Station and registered as Algapur Police Station Case No. 243/2015
    (corresponding to G.R. Case No.1025 of 2010) under Section 365/302 IPC.
    3.      It is submitted by the petitioner that one Nabin Kumar, Lieutenant of
    Manipur Army Camp also lodged an FIR before the Algapur Police Station on
    09.10.2010 with regard to the aforesaid incident, which was registered as Algapur
    Police Station Case No. 244/2010 (corresponding to G.R. Case No.1206/2010)
    under Section 489(B)/489(C) of the IPC.
    4.      The petitioner on 13.10.2010, lodged a Criminal Complaint before the Chief
    Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi being C.R. Case No. 1105c of 2010 against one Lt.
    Nabin Kumar and 16-17 nos. of army personnel of 117/36 Artillery Army Field
    Regiment from Manipur (South Hailakandi Army Camp) for the offences under
    Sections 147/148/149/364/457/442/384/120(B)/448/307/302/34 of IPC stating
    that though earlier she lodged an FIR on 09.10.2010 with regard to the same
    incident and assurances were given to her by the Superintendent of Police, Deputy
    Superintendent of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Hailakandi as well as other
    Crl. Ptn. No. 496 of 2010                                             Page 1 of 6

dignitaries that prompt action with regard to her FIR would be taken, but as no
action was taken till the filing of said complaint (13.10.2010) and where the
culprits have disclosed their identity by giving their telephone numbers and that as
the accused Nabin Kumar of Manipur Army Camp have already admitted the
incident, and even thereafter, no action had been taken by the authorities
concerned, she had to prefer the said criminal complaint petition. The learned CJM,
Hailakandi on perusal of the said complaint pertaining to C.R. Case No. 1105c/2010
directed the Officer-in-Charge of Algapur Police Station to register it as a case, to
investigate the matter and to submit the report.
5.      On receipt of the said criminal complaint and finding that the
complainant/petitioner had already filed an FIR for the same incident being
Algapur PS Case No. 243/2010 (corresponding to G.R. Case No. 210/2010), the
Officer-in-charge of Algapur Police Station filed a petition before the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Hailakandi praying for amalgamation of said C.R. Case No. 1105c/2010
preferred by the said complainant, i.e. the petitioner herein along with the G.R.
Case No. 1205/2010 arising out of Algapur PS Case No. 244/2010.
6.      Finding that the incident in both, the C.R. Case No. 1105C/2010 as well as
the Algapur PS Case No. 243/2010 being the same and that the parties involved in
both the matters are common, by its order dated 26.10.2010, the learned Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi allowed the amalgamation of said C.R. Case No.
1105C/2010 with the said G.R. Case No. 1205/2010, arising out of Algapur PS Case
No.243/2010, which was earlier registered on the basis of an FIR that was lodged
by the petitioner herself earlier on 09.10.2010.
7.      Being aggrieved with the said orders dated 13.10.2010 passed in her said
C.R. Case No.1105C/2010 in forwarding the same to the Officer-in-charge of
Algapur Police Station as well as the order dated 26.10.2010 allowing the prayer of
the Officer-in-Charge of Algapur Police Station in amalgamation of her said C.R.
Case No. 1105C/2010 with the Algapur PS Case No. 243/2010, the petitioner has
preferred this criminal petition for setting aside aforesaid two orders passed by the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi and to recall his impugned orders
dated 13.10.20100 and 26.10.2010 and to proceed with her said C.R. Case No.
1105C/2010.
Crl. Ptn. No. 496 of 2010                                               Page 2 of 6

8.      The petitioner submits that the inquest report of her deceased husband
dated 10.10.2010 as well as his post-mortem report dated 01.11.2010 disclosed
that he sustained several injuries on his person and as per his said post-mortem
report dated 01.11.2010, the cause of death of her husband was due to comma as
a result of head injuries sustained by him which were ante-mortem in nature
caused by blunt force impacts, which is homicidal in nature and that he had more
than five injuries on his person. The petitioner submitted that after filing of her
said complaint on 13.10.2010, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate should have
recorded her statement as well as the statements of her witnesses as provided
under Sections 200/202 Cr.P.C. She further urged that as a copy of the FIR
pertaining to Algapur Police Station Case No. 243/2010 was annexed with her said
complaint dated 13.10.2010, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi,
before proceeding with her said complaint being C.R. Case No. 1105C/2010, should
have sought for the report from the Algapur Police Station regarding the Algapur
Police Station Case No. 243/2010 as provided under Section 210 of Cr.P.C.,
instead of forwarding her said complaint C.R. Case No. 1105C/2010 to the Algapur
Police Station for its registration as a police case, directing the said police authority
to investigate the matter and to submit a report before him.
9.      As such the petitioners have prayed for quashing the aforementioned
orders dated 13.10.2010 and 26.10.2010 of the learned CJM, Hailakandi in her
complaint case being CR Case No. C1105C/2010 stating that as those orders have
been passed in violation of the provisions of Sections 190, 156 and 210 of the
Cr.P.C. and therefore, should be set aside and quashed.
10.     Chapter XIV of Cr.P.C. relates to conditions requisites for initiation of
proceedings that includes Section 190 to 199 of the Cr.P.C. whereas Chapter XVI
of the said Code relates to commencement of proceedings before Magistrate which
includes Section 204 to 210 of the Cr.P.C. and Chapter XII of the Code relates to
information to the police and their powers to investigate, which includes Section
154 to 176 of the Cr.P.C.
11.     From the perusal of the criminal complaint being C.R. Case No. 1105C/2010
filed by the petitioner before the CJM, Hailakandi on 13.10.2010, annexed to the
petition, it is seen that the petitioner stated that she was asked to sign a document
Crl. Ptn. No. 496 of 2010                                                 Page 3 of 6

before the Officer-in-Charge of Algapur Police Station on 09.10.2010 wherein she
put her signature, which she later came to know that said document is the FIR
dated 09.10.2010 written by one Abdul Kalam Laskar in the said police station
itself without consulting her and that the said FIR did not contain the details of the
incident as given in the said complaint and it is seen that copy of the said FIR
dated 09.10.2010 was not annexed with the said complaint.
12.      The Hon’ble Supreme Case in case of H.S. Banes -Vs- State, reported in
1980 (4) SCC 631 have observed that a Magistrate on receipt of a complaint
under Section 190 Cr.P.C. may order an investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
and receive a police report under Section 173(1) Cr.P.C. and, thereafter, the
Magistrate may do the three things, which are –
         (i)   that he may decide that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding
               further and drop action;
         (ii)  that he may take cognizance of the offence under section 190(1)(b) on
               the basis of the police report and he should proceed and, thus, he may
               do without being bound in any manner by the conclusion arrived at by
               the police in their report (under Section 173 Cr.P.C.); and
         (iii) that he may take cognizance under Section 190(1)(a) on the basis of
               the original complainant and proceed to examine the complaint and his
               witnesses under section 200 Cr.P.C.
13.      In the case of Sakri Vasu -Vs- State of U.P., reported in (2008) 4 SCC
409 , the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held that in-spite of registering an FIR, if no
proper investigation is held, it is open to the aggrieved person to approach the
concerned Magistrate, and in that circumstances, the Magistrate can direct proper
investigation to be made in a case where according to the aggrieved person no
proper investigation was made. The Hon’ble Apex Court in the said case have also
held that the Magistrate under section 153 Cr.P.C. can also monitor to ensure
proper investigation.
14.      In the case of Dilaw ar Singh -Vs- State of Delhi, reported in (2007)
12 SCC 641 , the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held that even if an FIR has been
registered and even if the police have made an investigation or is actually making
the investigation, which the aggrieved person feels is not proper, such a person
can approach the Magistrate under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and if the Magistrate is
satisfied that he can make proper investigation and take other suitable steps and
Crl. Ptn. No. 496 of 2010                                                Page 4 of 6

 pass such order(s) as he thinks necessary for ensuring a proper investigation.
15.      In the case of M ohd. Yousuf -Vs- Afaq Jahan, reported in (2006) 1
SCC 627 , the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held that a Judicial Magistrate before
taking cognizance of the offence, can order investigation under section 156(3) of
the Cr.P.C. and if he does so, he is not to examine the complainant on oath
because he was not taking cognizance of any offence therein. For the purpose of
enabling the police, to start investigation, it is open to the Magistrate to direct the
police to register an FIR and there is nothing illegal in doing so, after all
registration of an FIR involves only the process of entering the substance of the
information relating to the commission of cognizable offence in a book kept by the
officer-in-charge of the police station as indicated in Section 154 of the Cr.P.C.
Even if a Magistrate does not say in many words while directing investigation
under section 156(3) of the Code, that an FIR is to be registered, it is the duty of
the officer-in-charge to register an FIR regarding the cognizable offence disclosed
by the complainant because that police officer could take further steps
contemplated in the Chapter XII of the Code only thereafter.
16.      With regard to Section 210 of Cr.P.C., the condition precedent to attract the
said provision is that there must be a complaint case pending enquiry or trial and
during such enquiry or trial in the complaint case, it must be made to appear to
the Magistrate that an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to the
same offence which is the subject matter of the enquiry or trial held by him in the
complaint case and in that circumstances, the Magistrate had to stay the
proceeding in the enquiry or trial on the basis of the said private compliant and call
for the report from the concerned police officer conducting the investigation.
17.      In the present case, the complaint was lodged by the petitioner on
13.10.2010 and after perusing it, the CJM, Hailakandi forwarded the same to the
Officer-in-Charge of Algapur Police Station directing him to enquire in to the matter
and to furnish the report. As noted above, as per the decision of the Hon‘ble
Supreme Court in the case of H. S. Banes (supra), as the Magistrate concerned
has already forwarded the complaint of the petitioner to Algapur Police for
investigation under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., the said Magistrate is required to
Crl. Ptn. No. 496 of 2010                                               Page 5 of 6

proceed only after receipt of the investigation report under Section 173(1) of
Cr.P.C. from Algapur Police Station.
18.     For the reasons above, this Court is of the view that the impugned order
dated 13.10.2010 passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi in
C.R. Case No. 1105C/2010 as well as the order dated 26.10.2010 passed in G.R.
Case No. 1205/2010 need not be interfered with by exercising the jurisdiction
under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and, accordingly, this petition being devoid of
merit stands dismissed.
19.     It is to be noted herein that a Division Bench of this Court have already
passed an order dated 20.04.2017 passed in W.P.(C) No.6283 of 2010 that was
preferred by the petitioner, wherein the State Government has been directed to
pay compensation for an amount Rs. Rs.3,50,000/- to the petitioner for the death
of the husband of the petitioner due to brutal torture upon him during his custody
under army personnel. It is also observed that the investigation of said Algapur
Police Station Case No. 243/2010 (corresponding to G.R. Case No.1205/2010) with
which the complaint case of the petitioner being C.R. Case No. 1105C/2010 has
been amalgamated, has already been completed by the Algapur Police, where the
matter is ready for filing charge-sheet, and necessary sanction for Court
prosecution is awaited against the accused persons of the case including the army
personnel as well as the police personnel of the State; the Superintendent of
Police, Hailakandi shall do the needful to obtain necessary sanction from the
authority concerned.
20.     With the observation made herein above, this criminal petition stands
dismissed.
21.     A copy of this order be furnished to the Court of learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Hailakandi as well as to the Superintendent of Police, Hailakandi for
their necessary action.
                                                                 JUDGE
