                                        JUDGMENT & ORDER
                   Heard Mr. AJ Saikia, learned Amicus Curie and Mr. PS Lahkar,
         learned Addl. PP, Assam.
         [2]        This revision petition is filed challenging the order dated 31-05-
         2004, whereby learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Guwahati took
         cognizance of offencne under Section 200 and 209 of the IPC and issued
         process against the revision petitioners.
         [3]        One Shri Jagya Ram Mazumdar lodged a complaint before the
         learned Trial Court alleging that the revision petitioners were trying to
         dispossess the complainant from his land and also instituted various
         mutation proceeding before the revenue authority.                 It has also been
         alleged that the revision petitioners have filed mutation cases making false
         statement and submitting false document with the intention to occupy the
         property of the complainant. Learned Trial Court after examining the
         complainant under Section 200 Cr.P.C, took cognizance under Section
         200/209 IPC and issued process.
         [4]       Section 195(1) of the Cr.P.C reads as under:
                         (1) No Court shall take cognizance-
                         (a) (i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 (both
                         inclusive) of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860 ), or
                         (ii) of any abetment of, or attempt to commit, such offence, or
                         (iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, except on the
                         complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other
                         public servant to whom he is administratively subordinate;
                         (b) (i) of any offence punishable under any of the following sections
                         of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860 ), namely, sections 193 to 196
                         (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when
                         such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to,
                         any proceeding in any Court, or
                         (ii) of any offence described in section 463, or punishable under
                         section 471, section 475 or section 476, of the said Code, when such
Crl. Rev. P No.184/2005

                                                                                             3
                          offence is alleged to have been committed in respect of a document
                          produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court, or
                          (iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit, or attempt to commit, or
                          the abetment of, any offence specified in sub- clause (i) or sub-
                          clause (ii), except on the complaint in writing of that Court, or of
                          some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.
                          (2) Where a complaint has been made by a public servant under
                          clause (a) of sub- section (1) any authority to which he is
                          administratively subordinate may order the withdrawal of the
                          complaint and send a copy of such order to the Court; and upon its
                          receipt by the Court, no further proceedings shall be taken on the
                          complaint: Provided that no such withdrawal shall be ordered if the
                          trial in the Court of first instance has been concluded.
         [5]       It is abundantly clear from the clause-(b)(i) of Section 195(1) that
         no magistrate shall take cognizance of any offence under Section
         199/200/205 to 211 (both inclusive) except on a complaint in writing of a
         Court.
         [6]         In the present case, there was no complaint in writing by any
         Court or Magistrate as contemplated in Section 195 of the Cr.P.C,
         whereas, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of offence under Section
         200/209 on the basis of a private complaint, which is apparently beyond
         the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate. Therefore, the impugned order
         of taking cognizance and issuing process by the learned Magistrate
         without jurisdiction is liable to be set-aside.
          [7]         Accordingly, the impugned order by which the learned Trial
         Court took cognizance and issued process against the revision petitioners
         is set-aside and the proceeding under CR Case No.797c/2004 is also
         quashed. The revision petition is accordingly allowed.
         [8]        Appreciating the assistance rendered by Mr. AJ Saikia, learned
         Amicus Curiae, I hereby provide that he will be entitled to fees, as Legal
         Aid Counsel as per the norms fixed by the Legal Services Authority

         Regulation. Upon production of a copy of this judgment, Guwahati High
         Court Legal Services Committee shall pay the fee to Mr. AJ Saikia.
