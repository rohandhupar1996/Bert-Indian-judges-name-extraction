       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PRADEEP NANDRAJOG
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V. KAMESWAR RAO
PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
1.     Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2.     Ignoring the reasons given by the Central Administrative Tribunal in
the impugned decision dated September 14, 2011, we are of the opinion that
the final conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal is correct requiring instant
writ petition to be dismissed.
3.     Issue pertains to filling up one vacant post of Assistant Engineer (E &
M) as of the year 1988. At the DPC held on January 16, 2002 name of Vijay
Singh was recommended for promotion for the solitary post. Petitioner
challenged the same resulting in the Central Administrative Tribunal
deciding, on June 03, 2009, that a review DPC be held.
4.     The reason was the allegation made by the petitioner that the ACRs of
Vijay Singh were tampered with. Petitioner also had an issue whether, the
post being a selection post, criteria as per DoPT Memorandum dated March
27, 1997 or as per OM dated February 08, 2002 was required to be adhered
to.
W.P.(C) 693/2012                                                     Page 1 of 2

5.     Review DPC was held on September 04, 2009. Once again Vijay
Singh was empanelled for promotion.
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner keep on harping that his client’s
ACRs are better than that of Vijay Singh.
7.     When asked, where are the pleadings to said effect with material
particulars i.e. in which paragraph of the Original Application has the
petitioner pleaded that his ACRs gradings was         ‘such and such’       and
similarly qua Vijay Singh, learned counsel has not been able to show any.
8.     Annexed as Annexure-9 to the writ petition from pages 51 to 58 are
the pleadings in the Original Application and we find no such comparative
tabulation done.
9.     It is settled law that for a selection post a bench mark has to be
considered. All those who make the bench mark would be treated as fit, but
only said candidates would be promoted who would be senior in the list of
selected candidates commensurate to the number of vacancies. There is no
concept that with respect to a selection post only the best person earns
further promotion.
10.    Further, in the absence of any data shown that the petitioner had a
better service profile, no relief can be granted and hence the writ petition is
dismissed in limine.
11.    No costs.
                                          (PRADEEP NANDRAJOG)
