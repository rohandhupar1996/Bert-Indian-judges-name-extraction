Pasupati Nath Das, the present appellant, as Executor named in the Will
dated 12th April, 1963 applied for grant of Probate of said Will by filing
Probate Case No. 101 of 1967 in Calcutta High Court. A joint caveat was

                                                                            4
filed by Shyama Sundari Dassi and Purnima Rani Dassi. It was alleged that
by subsequent Deed of Revocation dated 15th October, 1963 the aforesaid
Will had stood revoked. The application for grant of Probate of the Will of
Nandlal Das, being a contentious cause was numbered as Testamentary Suit
No. 6 of 1971.
4.     Shyama Sundari Dassi thereafter executed a registered Will on 12th
October, 1973. It was stated therein that she did not want her estate to go
into the hands of her younger son, the appellant; that while her husband was
alive he had cancelled and nullified the Will dated 12 th April, 1963 being
displeased with the behavior of said son and his family; that the estate left
behind by her husband devolved equally on her and two sons; that she had
received large sum of cash and ornaments from her sister and brother-in-law
and that the properties mentioned in the Schedule to the said Will were her
properties. By said Will, she appointed one Harendra Nath Das, Manager of
the estate to be the Executor, and stated that after her death one Menoka
Rani Dasi, her brother’s wife and Harendra Nath Das would get equal shares
in the property. The list of properties mentioned in Schedules Ka, Kha and
Ga to the Will dated 12th October, 1973 were as under:

5.    In Testamentary Suit No. 6 of 1971, Shyama Sundari Dassi and
Harendra Nath Das gave evidence. By order dated 19th September, 1975
Single Judge of the High Court granted Probate of the will dated 12 th April,
1963 of Nandlal Das in favour of Pasupati Nath Das. On 22 nd September,
1975 Shyama Sundari Dassi died. Appeal No.371 of 1975 was thereafter
filed by Harendra Nath Das against the aforesaid judgment dated 19 th

                                                                       8
September, 1975. Further, an application for grant of Probate of the Will
dated 12th October, 1973 executed by Shyama Sundari Dassi was filed by
Harendra Nath Das and Menoka Rani Dassi. Since a caveat was filed by
Pasupati Nath Das and the matter was contested, it was numbered as
Testamentary Suit No.8 of 1976.
6.    In Testamentary Suit No.8 of 1976, following issues were framed by
Single Judge of the High Court
      “i)    Was the Will dated October 12, 1973 duly executed and
             attested?
      ii)    Is the Will dated October 12, 1973 genuine?
      iii)    a) Did the testatrix Shyama Sundari Dassi have
             testamentary capacity to execute Will?
             b) Did the testatrix suffer from Senile Dementia at the
             time of execution of the Will?
      iv)    Was the Will executed under undue influence exercised
             by Harendra Nath Das?
      v)     To what relief, if any, the propounder is entitled?
7.    On 14th October, 1982, the Division Bench of the High Court
dismissed Appeal No.371 of 1975 and confirmed the judgment and decree
dated 19th September, 1975 passed in Testamentary Suit No. 6 of 1971.

                                                                            9
8.     On 27th February, 1984 Single Judge of the High Court dismissed
Testamentary Suit No.8 of 1976 in which the grant of Probate of the Will
dated 12th October, 1973 of Shyama Sundari Dassi was sought. Issues i), ii)
and iiib) were found in favour of the propounders of the Will while issues
iiia) and iv) were answered against said propounders. This decision was
challenged by Harendra Nath Das and Menoka Rani Dassi by filing Appeal
No. 60 of 1984 before the Division Bench of the High Court.
9.     Since there was no cross appeal, only two issues namely iiia) and iv)
were required to be considered by the Division Bench. After going through
the entirety of the matter the Division Bench accepted the appeal. On facts it
was found that there were no suspicious circumstances and that the testatrix
was in sound disposition of mind at the time of the execution of the Will.
The Division Bench observed as under:
              “……….The fact remains that the solicitor was called at
       the residence and the doctor was present. There is no allegation
       of threat being given to the lady. There is no material to show
       that there was any occasion for the testatrix to execute the Will
       in favour of Harendra Nath to purchase peace. There is no
       material to show that Harendra Nath had exploited the
       sentiment of the lady or otherwise had exerted any force or fear
       or had given any hopes.
              …………………………

                                                                           10
        ……….The signature on each page and the signature of all
        corrections are also indicative of the fact that she knew the
        contents of the Will. The Will was read over and explained to
        her and she had signed in the presence of the attesting
        witnesses, which have since been so found by the learned
        Single Judge… … …”
        Directing that Probate as prayed for be granted, the appeal was
allowed by judgment and order dated 4th February, 2005, which decision is
presently under appeal.
10.     During the pendency of this appeal, both Pasupati Nath Das and
Harendra Nath Das expired. The heirs of deceased Harendra Nath Das were
brought on record. Interlocutory Application Nos.5 and 8 seeking to bring
the heirs of the deceased Pasupati Nath Das on record are allowed. One of
the legal representatives of deceased Pasupati Nath Das is no more, and his
legal representatives are sought to be brought on record vide Interlocutory
Application No.111556 of 2018. Said application is also allowed. Cause
title shall stand amended accordingly.
11.     We heard Mr. Raja Chatterjee, learned Advocate for the appellants and
Mr. Ajay Kumar Gupta, learned senior advocate for the respondents. It was
submitted by Mr. Chatterjee, learned Advocate that under the Will of

                                                                           11
Nandlal Das, properties mentioned in Parts I and II of the Testament were
given in charity while those mentioned in Part III were given absolutely in
favour of his two sons and Shyama Sundari Dassi, the widow, was given
only a life estate and right of maintenance. Therefore, according to him,
Shyama Sundari Dassi could not have dealt with those properties which
were inherited from her husband. These submissions were countered by Mr.
Ajay Kumar Gupta, learned Senior Advocate who submitted that very
comparison of properties mentioned in respective Schedules to the Wills
would show that there were various properties which belonged to Shyama
Sundari Dassi in her individual capacity and that she was entitled to dispose
of the same by executing a Will.
12.    We must, at the outset, say that the scope of the matter arising from
Probate proceedings is very limited. The scope of the matter is primarily
and principally regarding the genuineness of the execution of the testament
or Will. This part has been succinctly dealt with in a decision rendered by
this Court in Krishna Kumar Birla v. Rajendra Singh Lodha and Others.1.
Paragraphs 57, 66 and 67 of the said decision spell out the scope of the
enquiry in Probate proceedings as under:
1 (2008) 4 SCC 300

                                                                    12
“57. The 1925 Act in this case has nothing to do with the law of
inheritance or succession which is otherwise governed by
statutory laws or the custom, as the case may be. It makes
detailed provisions as to how and in what manner an
application for grant of probate is to be filed, considered and
granted or refused. Rights and obligations of the parties as also
the executors and administrators appointed by the court are laid
down therein. Removal of the existing executors and
administrators and appointment of subsequent executors are
within the exclusive domain of the court. The jurisdiction of the
Probate Court is limited being confined only to consider the
genuineness of the will. A question of title arising under the Act
cannot be gone into the (sic probate) proceedings. Construction
of a will relating to the right, title and interest of any other
person is beyond the domain of the Probate Court. (Emphasis
by us)
                         ………
                         ………
66. We may, however, at the outset, notice a decision of this
Court in Elizabeth Antony v. Michel Charles John Chown
Lengera (1990) 3 SCC 333 which is binding on us. Therein, the
testatrix viz. one Mary Aline Browne, was the wife of one
Herbet Evander Browne, the eldest son of John Browne. Mary
died on 28-3-1972. She had executed a will on 12-3-1962. An
application for grant of a letter of administration with a copy of
the will annexed was filed by Michel. Petitioner Elizabeth
Antony and her husband Zoe Enid Browne filed caveats on the
plea that the said will was a forged document. The petitioner
therein also claimed that her daughter Browne had executed a
will on 23-6-1975 and she had executed a deed of gift in favour
of the petitioner. She also claimed herself to be a trustee of John
Browne Trust. The Probate Court held that they had no
caveatable interest. Caveatable interest, therefore, was claimed
as an executor and legatee of the will executed by Zoe Enid
Browne as also a deed of gift in respect of one item of the estate
executed in their favour. Caveatable interest was also claimed
on the premise that the petitioner was appointed a trustee of
John Browne Trust. This Court noticed a large number of High

                                                                    13
Court judgments. It was, however, opined that the petitioner
therein failed to establish a caveatable interest stating: (SCC p.
336, para 6)
               “6. … We have perused the entire order of the trial
       court in the context. Admittedly neither the original nor a
       copy of the will said to have been executed by Zoe Enid
       Browne, was filed. Now coming to the trust, it is in the
       evidence of PW 1 that John Browne Trust has come to an
       end in March 1972 and the same was not in existence.
       The trial court has considered both the documentary and
       oral evidence in this regard and has rightly held that the
       petitioner has no existing benefit from the trust. Likewise
       the registered gift deed or a copy of it has not been filed.
       Before the learned Single Judge of the High Court also
       same contentions were put forward. The learned Judge
       observed that from the objections filed by the caveator
       she desires the court in the probate proceedings to uphold
       her title on the strength of a gift deed and the trust deed.
       It is observed:
               ‘Equally, the petitioner has not placed before
               the court the will dated 23-6-1975 stated to
               have been executed by Zoe Enid Browne to
               establish that under the will dated 12-3-1962
               stated to have been executed by Mary Aline
               Browne some interest given to the petitioner
               under the will dated 23-6-1975 of Zoe Enid
               Browne, is liable to be in any manner
               affected or otherwise displaced, by the grant
               of letters of administration in respect of the
               will dated 12-3-1962 stated to have been
               executed by Mary Aline Browne.’
       Accordingly, the learned Judge held that the petitioner
has not established that she has a caveatable interest justifying
her opposition to the probate proceedings for grant of letters of

       interest.”
       This Court, thus, categorically opined that while granting a
       probate, the court would not decide any dispute with regard to
       title. A separate suit would be maintainable therefor. If probate
       is granted, they have a remedy in terms of Section 263 of the
       1925 Act also.
       67. In the recent judgment of Kanwarjit Singh Dhillon v.
       Hardyal Singh Dhillon (2007) 11 SCC 357 this Court inter alia
       relying upon Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka v. Jasjit Singh (1993)
       2 SCC 507 and upon referring to a catena of decisions of the
       High Court and this Court, held that the Probate Court does not
       decide any question of title or of the existence of the property
       itself.” (Emphasis by us)
13.    We, therefore, confine ourselves only to the issue whether the
execution of the Will of which Probate is prayed for has been satisfactorily
proved and whether there are any suspicious circumstances impinging upon
the execution of the Will. Out of four issues, three were answered in favour
of the propounders of the Will by the Single Judge wherefrom no appeal was
preferred. The matter was thus limited in scope before the Division Bench
which, in any case, has answered the other issues also in favour of the
propounders of the Will. Having gone through the judgment under appeal,
we do not see any reason to take a different view in the matter nor has any
ground been made out to upset the decision under appeal.

                                                                           15
14.    We, thus, confirm the decision of the Division Bench. All the issues,
including those whether the properties in respect of both the Schedules are
identical or not will have to be raised and dealt with in properly instituted
proceedings. Reserving all those rights, we dismiss the present appeal. No
costs.
