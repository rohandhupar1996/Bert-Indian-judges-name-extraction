CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
ASHUTOSH KUMAR, J.
1.    The present appeal on behalf of the State is directed against the
judgment and order of acquittal dated 2.9.2011 passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-02 (South), Saket Courts, New Delhi in SC
No.222/2009 (refer FIR No.250/2009, P.S.Malviya Nagar) whereby
the Respondents herein have been acquitted of the charges under
Section 302/201 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC for short).
2.    The Respondents namely Praveen Sharma and Hemant Sharma
were charged for murdering one Babu Lal @ Mukul in furtherance of
CRL.A.117/2014                                               Page 1 of 22

their common intention as also for destroying the evidence of the
crime by throwing the dead body and parking the motorcycle of the
deceased near a drain at Sheikh Sarai, Delhi.
3.     A dead body of a male and a motorcycle bearing registration
No.DL 3S BA 0150 at some distance from the body, was located by
constable Manmohan, (PW.11) in the night intervening between 22nd
and 23rd May, 2009. This was informed by him to the Police Station
and DD No.46A was recorded. The same was handed over to ASI
Gopi Chand, (PW.13), who found injuries on the neck of the deceased
and blood stains on the motorcycle. Sensing it to be a case of murder,
crime team was summoned. The crime team came to the spot and took
the photographs.
4.     The identity of the owner of the motorcycle could be garnered
on the basis of certain documents, which were found in the
motorcycle. It was found to be belonging to one Babu Lal, son of Ram
Kishore. PW.13, prepared a rukka (Ex.PW.13/A) and an FIR
No.250/2009 was registered under Sections 302/201 and 34 of the IPC
(Ex.PW.1/B).
CRL.A.117/2014                                            Page 2 of 22

5.    At about the same time, a missing report was lodged at Kalkaji
police station at about 2.40 AM vide DD No.38A, intimating that one
Babu Lal @ Mukul son of Ram Kishore had not reached home.
6.    One Chote Lal (PW.6), the brother of aforesaid Babu Lal @
Mukul (deceased) on receiving information that a dead body has been
found at Sheikh Sarai reached the place of occurrence and identified
the dead body and the motorcycle to be that of his brother. His
statement was recorded (Ex.PW.6/H) in which he stated that his wife
Vandana, (PW.3) had talked to Babu Lal (deceased) in the evening
when she was told by him that he would come home by 10 PM. When
Babu Lal (deceased) did not reach home till late in the night, an
attempt was made to contact him on telephone but the same was
switched off.
7.    Dr.Raghvinder Kumar, (PW.21) performed the autopsy on the
dead body and found the following injuries:-
     “1. A firearm entry wound was present over right side of
         neck which was oval in shape having irregular margins
         with dimension 4.5 x 3.0 cm and 3.0 cm from midline
         just above clavicle. The margins were blackened on
         medical aspect. Multiple pallets wound were present
         around the wound in total area of 15.0 X 6.0 cm and
CRL.A.117/2014                                          Page 3 of 22

          were superficial. The blood vessels of right side were
          severed due to firearm injury. Multiple pallets were
          recovered from deep tissues and vertebral column.
          Cervical fifth vertebra found to be fractured alongwith
          laceration of spinal cord. Diffused haemotoma was
          present in right side of neck, muscles and vertebral
          columns.
      2. One abrasion of size 3 x 2 cm was present over left
          cheek. It was reddish in colour.
      3. One contusion of size 1x 1cm was present over inner
          aspect of left side of lower lip. It was reddish in colour.
          No other external injury was present.
          In the stomach about 50 ml of semi digested food was
          present. Mucosa congested.”
8.     PW.22 has opined that the death was due to haemorrhagic shock
as a result of injury No.1 which was caused by fire arm and it was
sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The time
was fixed at 1½ days of the time of post mortem examination.
9.     Chote Lal, (PW.6) stated before the Trial Court that the
deceased had left home for his office on 22.5.2009 but had not come
back till 10 PM. When he did not return till about 12 in the midnight,
he called Adarsh, (PW.2) on his mobile. Aforesaid Adarsh is stated to
have told PW.6 that the deceased had not met him on that day and that
he did not have any talk with him for last so many days. When PW.6
confronted him with the statement of his brother (deceased) that he
CRL.A.117/2014                                                Page 4 of 22

was with him, aforesaid Adarsh did not give any response. Thereafter
a call was made at number 100 and a missing report ultimately was
lodged.
10.    PW.6 has further stated that the telephone number of Adarsh,
(PW.2) was taken from him by the police. When PW.6 had visited
Malviya Nagar police station in the morning of 23.5.2009, he found
Adarsh at the police station. Further, during the course of
investigation, the Respondents were apprehended at the instance of
Adarsh, (PW.2) and Nek Ram, (PW.4). At the time of the arrest of the
Respondents, no recovery was effected from their person. However, it
was stated by PW.6 that the Respondents took the police party and
him to Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag
Delhi, where his brother was murdered. The Respondents also led the
police party to the parking area near B Block, Safdarjung Enclave
behind Delhi Police Public School and at the pointing out of the
Respondents a country made pistol was recovered. A live cartridge
was also found near the weapon. A used cartridge was found inside
the weapon.
11.    PW.6 has averred before the Trial Court that his wife Vandana,
CRL.A.117/2014                                           Page 5 of 22

(PW.3) told him at about 10 PM on 22.5.2009, that the deceased had
told her that he would come home by 11 PM and would take dinner.
12.    Vandana, (PW.3) has stated before the Trial Court that she had
called the deceased between 8 - 8.30 PM. The deceased had then
informed her that he would come home late in the night. He also
informed her that he was present at that time in Devika Security
Services office at 550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi with his friends namely
Praveen Sharma and Hemant Sharma (respondent Nos.1 and 2
respectively), Adarsh (PW2) and Nek Ram (PW 4). Since the
deceased did not return, an attempt was made to talk to him on
telephone which also could not materialize as the telephone was found
to be switched off. Thereafter a missing report was registered.
13.    From the testimonies of PW.6 and PW.3, it becomes evident
that PW.3 had contacted the deceased sometime between 8 - 8.30 PM
on 22.5.2009 when the deceased is said to have spoken about his being
in the company of the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and PWs.2 and 4 at
Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi.
This information was transmitted to PW.6 by PW.3. Thereafter when
the deceased did not come at around 12 AM, a missing report was
CRL.A.117/2014                                              Page 6 of 22

lodged at the instance of PW.6. However, DD No. 38A has neither
been proved nor has been marked as an exhibit.
14.    Further as per testimonies it appears that the police visited
Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi only
on 25.5.2009, i.e. after three days of the recovery of the dead body of
the deceased. This creates doubts, as to why it was not informed by
PW.6 to the police that the deceased, as per the version of PW.3, was
at Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi
with PW.2 and PW.4, in the company of Respondent nos.1 and 2,
when the missing report was lodged by PW.6 after the deceased not
having returned home till late in the night. Had PW.6 stated about this
fact, the police would have proceeded for that place straightway after
the identification of the dead body. Admittedly, the police party
visited Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag
Delhi only on 25.5.2009. The withholding of such vital information in
the missing report by PW.6 creates a doubt about the prosecution
version that the deceased was in company of the Respondent Nos. 1
and 2 and PW.2 and PW.4 at the office of Devika Security Services,
House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi. Thus we doubt, whether the
CRL.A.117/2014                                              Page 7 of 22

deceased Babu Lal when he spoke to PW.3 between 8 to 8.30 PM on
22.05.2009, had indicated and told her that he was in the company of
the respondents, PW.2 and PW.4 at the office of Devika Security
services. The aforesaid facts have been added, in view of the police
version to implicate the respondents.
15.    In this context the observation of the Trial Court appears to be
very logical and justified and is reproduced as under:-
     “PW.3 Vandana in her testimony deposed on oath that on
     22.05.09 she had called her devar Babu Lal (deceased)
     between 8 pm to 8.30 pm as he had not returned to house till
     that time, who informed her that he would return to home by
     10 or 10.30 pm and also informed that he was present at
     Devika Security Services office at 550, Chirag Delhi with
     his friends namely Hemant, Praveen, Adarsh and Nek Ram.
     PW.6 Chote Lal in this regard deposed on oath that on
     22.05.09, his brother had left for his office and did not
     return back till 10 pm. At around 10 pm, when he reached
     back his home, his wife told him that Babu Lal would come
     around 11 pm and would take dinner and also stated that
     we may take dinner. His wife further told him that around
     8.30 pm, she had called Babu Lal and Babu Lal had told her
     that he was sitting at Devika Security office with Adarsh,
     Hemant, Praveen and Nek Ram.
     Thus, both these witnesses tried to make out a case that at
     8.30 pm, deceased had told them that he was with Adarsh,
     Hemant, Praveen and Nek Ram at office of Devika Security
     Services. However, this part of the testimony becomes
     doubtful in view of the fact that firstly in DD No.31A
     recorded at P.S. Kalkaji at around 2.40 pm, it was merely
CRL.A.117/2014                                             Page 8 of 22

      informed from telephone number 9899766882, which is
      telephone number of PW.6 Chote Lal, as reflected in his
      own testimony, that Babu Lal @ Mukul aged 23 years who
      had started from Nehru Place at 8.30 pm has not reached
      home. Beside this, PW.6 in his statement Ex.Pw.6/H
      recorded by ASI Gopi Chand simply stated that his wife
      Vandana (PW3) called Babu Lal to enquired at around 8.30
      pm on which Babu Lal told that he is in Chirag Delhi and
      would come back at around 10 pm. In both these versions of
      PW6 Chote Lal, there is no mention of deceased being
      present along with accused persons. It is also pertinent to
      mention here that this part of the testimony is only
      regarding the fact that deceased had told that he was with
      the accused persons before the death. There is no evidence
      led by the prosecution to the fact that deceased was seen
      with the accused persons before his death. I consider that
      non mentioning of the accused persons in DD No.31A,
      which has not been proved by the prosecution for the
      reasons best known to them, and in the statement
      Ex.PW.6/H, makes the version of prosecution doubtful.”
16.     This brings us to the testimonies of PWs.2 and 4 who as per the
prosecution version were eye witnesses to the occurrence, but had
later resiled and turned hostile.
17.     Adarsh, PW.2 stated before the Trial Court that on 22.5.2009 at
around 7 PM, the deceased had come to his office at 550, 2 nd Floor,
Chirag Delhi and both of them had left for their houses at 8 PM. He
claims to have gone back to his home on his bike whereas deceased
also left for his home on his motorcycle. According to him no incident
CRL.A.117/2014                                             Page 9 of 22

took place in his presence. He could learn about the death of the
deceased only on the information provided by PW.6 on the next day.
18.    Nek Ram, (PW.4), another eye witness also does not support the
case of the prosecution and has stated that he worked as a field officer
in Devika Security Services and after staying in the office till 8 PM he
left for his home. He also claims to have learnt about the murder of the
deceased after 2-3 days of the occurrence when he received a call from
the Malviya Nagar police station. On reaching Malviya Nagar police
station he found Respondent Nos.1 and 2 present there.
19.    From the deposition of the aforesaid two witnesses, who have
turned hostile, the only fact which can be discerned is that the
deceased was known to PWs.2 and 4. PW.2 has also deposed as to the
presence of the deceased with him at 550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi on
22.5.2009 at about 7 P.M. However, the aforesaid witnesses failed to
connect the respondents with the crime or depose as to their presence.
20.    The prosecution, thus having failed to bolster up its case
through the eyes of PWs.2 and 4, relied upon other connecting links to
the crime namely the recovery of fire arms on the disclosure of the
CRL.A.117/2014                                              Page 10 of 22

Respondents; recovery of blood stained furniture from Devika
Security Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi as well as
the forensic report.
21.    Be it noted that charges against the appellants were not framed
under Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959. On going through the
records, it appears that an application was filed on behalf of the
prosecution for framing of the charges under Section 27 of the Arms
Act on the ground that no sanction was required. The Respondents
have made disclosure statements (Ex.PW.14/A and 14/B) stating that
they had thrown the fire arm along with the used and live cartridge at a
parking place near Delhi Police Public School, Safdarjung Enclave,
New Delhi. The same was recovered from the place pointed out by the
Respondents. Chote Lal, (PW.6) has attested to such seizure. No
independent person has been a witness to such a seizure which
apparently has been made from a public place.
22.    Thus in the absence of any definite and categorical information
as to on whose pointing out, the weapon was discovered; charges not
having been framed under the Arms Act and no independent person
having been a witness to such a seizure, the same cannot be taken as
CRL.A.117/2014                                            Page 11 of 22

incriminating for any useful purpose, in the facts of the present case,
elucidated below. The recovery must be connected with offence, for
application of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
23.    The country made pistol, which was allegedly recovered at the
instance of the Respondents was put to forensic examination. The
forensic report which is exhibit (Ex.PW.23/XI) discloses that the
weapon was in a working condition. However, the independent
characteristics of the lead pellets were insufficient for comparison and
it could not be ascertained with exactitude whether those had been
fired through the weapon which is said to have been recovered. Thus
the pistol could not be connected and linked with the lead pellets
recovered from the body of the deceased.
24.    As has been noted above, after about three days of the finding
of the dead body of the deceased, office of Devika Security Services,
at House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi was visited by the police
authorities. The door of the office was found to be locked. There is
complete blurring of evidence as to who had locked the doors or
whether anybody had entered the precincts in the interregnum i.e.
between 22.5.2009 and 25.5.2009, when the police party had visited
CRL.A.117/2014                                               Page 12 of 22

that office. However, blood was found on the chairs and table in the
office. The blood group of the stains found in the office and that of
the deceased was found to be matching, but this by itself does not take
us to any conclusions on involvement of the respondents. In case of
circumstantial evidence, we have to rule out possibility of involvement
of third persons. The very factum of the police finding blood stains on
the furniture of Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2 nd Floor,
Chirag Delhi after 3 days is a cause to suspect and creates doubts. If at
all the door of the office was found to be locked on 25.5.2009,
whether the evidence of the crime would have been allowed to remain
there, becomes somewhat questionable. Even if we accept that the
deceased Babu Lal, was murdered in the said office, the question
remains as to who had murdered him.
25.     It would further be relevant in this context to state that Dinesh,
(PW.10) who is the owner and the landlord of the premises has also
expressed his ignorance as to whether the Respondents were present at
the time in premises of Devika Security Services, House No.550, 2 nd
Floor, Chirag Delhi. He has not deposed whether the office had
remained open between 22.05.2009 to 25.05.2009, and who were the
CRL.A.117/2014                                                Page 13 of 22

visitors.
26.    These surrounding circumstances, in our opinion, do not
complete the chain and leave many latent wedges and chinks open in
the entire prosecution version. The questions which trouble us are as
to how the deceased was bundled in a bed sheet and brought to a
considerable distance along with his motorcycle, without anybody
noticing such a movement. Why did no one hear the gun shot and see
the body being taken down? What could have been the reason for
PWs.3 and 6 for withholding such a vital information, namely the
deceased being present at Devika Security Services, House No.550,
2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi in the company of Respondents and PWs.2 and
4 in the night of 22.5.2009, at around 8 to 8:30 p.m. in the missing
report? Why did PW.2 and PW.4 not report and inform PW.3 and
PW.6 about the occurrence on 25.5.2009? Only absence of such a
vital information having been disseminated, one can justify the visit of
the police at the suggested place of crime after three days of the
finding of the dead body. Who locked the doors of Devika Security
Services, House No.550, 2nd Floor, Chirag Delhi and why was the
evidence with respect to the crime left when sufficient number of
CRL.A.117/2014                                            Page 14 of 22

hours had elapsed. The factum that the crime was committed in the
said office, would be the starting point and could possibly reflect
involvement of a person associated or working there, but this would
not be sufficient, to implicate the respondents, unless the respondents
presence at the spot is established.
27.     The law with regard to circumstantial evidence is no longer res
integra. In order to prove the case on the basis of circumstantial
evidence, all the circumstances so put up must unerringly indicate
towards the guilt of the accused persons and should simultaneously
exclude their innocence and involvement of a third person. The latter
part is equally material and should be established.
28.     In State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Raj Kumar, AIR 2014 SC
1929, the Supreme Court, has reiterated and reproduced the “five
golden principles” of proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence.
The same has been reproduced hereunder:
      “9. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of
      Maharashtra (1984) 4 SCC 116, this Court laid down the
      five principles as regards the proof of a case based
      on circumstantial evidence. This Court has reiterated those
      principles time and again. They are:
CRL.A.117/2014                                             Page 15 of 22

           (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion
           of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.
                 xxx xxx xxx
           (2) the facts so established should be consistent
           only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused,
           that is to say, they should not be explainable on
           any other hypothesis except that the accused is
           guilty,
           (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive
           nature and tendency,
           (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis
           except the one to be proved, and
           (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete
           as not to leave any reasonable ground for the
           conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
           accused and must show that in all human
           probability the act must have been done by the
           accused.”
29.    In Dhan Raj @ Dhand vs. State of Haryana (2014) 6 SCC 745,
the Supreme Court whilst setting aside a judgment and order of
conviction passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court had
observed as under:
     “2. The High Court in the present matters convicted
     the accused Appellants on the basis                           of
      circumstantial evidence by the impugned judgment. It has
     been well established by leading judicial precedents that
     where the prosecution's case is based on circumstantial
     evidence, only the circumstantial evidence of the highest
     order can satisfy the test of proof in a criminal prosecution.
     In order to base conviction on circumstantial evidence the
      circumstantial evidence put forth by the prosecution should
     establish a complete unbroken chain of events so that only
CRL.A.117/2014                                               Page 16 of 22

    one inference is drawn out from the same. If more than one
    inference can be drawn then the accused should be entitled
    to the benefit of doubt. ...”
    “14. We would refer to the decision of this Court in Madhu
    v. State of Kerala (2012) 2 SCC 399 the facts of which are
    relevant in the present case. In the said case, the body of the
    deceased was found near her home with her ornaments on
    her person missing. On the basis of the information
    furnished by the accused recovery of the said ornaments
    was made. This fact coupled with the sighting of the accused
    near the place of crime was the basis for conviction.
    However, this Court reversed the conviction on the ground
    that said recovery and sighting of the accused near the
    deceased do not lead to the sole conclusion that murder was
    committed by the accused only. In State of Rajasthan v.
    Talevar and Anr. (2011) 11 SCC 666 also it was held that
    where the only evidence against the accused is recovery of
    stolen property, then although circumstances may indicate
    that theft and murder might have been committed at the
    same time, it is not safe to draw an inference that the person
    in possession of stolen property had committed murder.
    Also the recovery of looted articles at the instance of the
    accused could not be relied upon in absence of any details
    as to when and where such recovery was made and in
    absence of any confession of commission of offence by the
    accused. Besides, the seizure of the goods was not
    corroborated by any independent witness in the present
    case.”
     “17. We have noticed in Madhu v. State of Kerala (supra)
    facts of which were discussed earlier, that this Court inspite
    of the factum that the accused were sighted close to the
    place of occurrence at around the time of occurrence
    reversed the conviction as guilt was not established. In the
    present factual matrix, it is only an interested witness
    stating that the accused had come asking for the deceased.
    This factum alone does not establish guilt as no other
    evidence is found that they were near the Bizdipur area
CRL.A.117/2014                                             Page 17 of 22

    where the crime was committed or had visited the house of
    the deceased.
    18. For establishing the guilt on the basis
    of circumstantial evidence, it is also to be taken into
    account that the chain of circumstantial evidence must be
    completed. It appears from the facts that the said chain of
    circumstantial evidence cannot be concluded in the manner
    sought to be done by the prosecution. The circumstances
    must be conclusive in nature. In the instant case, after
    analyzing the facts, it appears to us that there is a gap
    between the circumstances tried to be relied upon to hold
    the Appellants as guilty.Thus, we find many loopholes in the
    case of the prosecution and grounds on which the High
    Court has convicted the Appellant- accused.
    19. We would refer to the decision of this Court in Munish
    Mubar v. State of Haryana (2012) 10 SCC 464 wherein Dr.
    Justice Chauhan has very aptly and succinctly stated the
    following: (SCC p. 473, para 28)
       “28. ...The circumstantial evidence is a close
       companion of factual matrix, creating a fine network
       through which there can be no escape for the
       accused, primarily because the said facts, when
       taken as a whole, do not permit us to arrive at any
       other inference but one indicating the guilt of the
       accused.”
    A court has to examine the entire evidence in its entirety
    especially in case of circumstantial evidence and ensure
    that the only inference drawn from the evidence is the guilt
    of the accused. If more than one inference can be drawn
    then the accused must have the benefit of doubt as it is not
    the court's job to assume and only when guilt beyond
    reasonable doubt is proved then it is fair to record
    conviction. In case of circumstantial evidence, each
    circumstance must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by
    independent evidence, and the circumstances so proved
    must form a complete chain without giving any chance of
CRL.A.117/2014                                           Page 18 of 22

     surmise or conjecture and must also be consistent with the
     guilt of the accused.
     20. None of the circumstances relied upon by the
     prosecution and accepted by the High Court can be said to
     be the probability of the Appellants' guilt or involvement in
     the commission of the crime. ...”
30.    Thus from a conspectus of the foregoing discussions, there is no
scintilla of doubt that the prosecution has failed to prove its case
beyond all shadow of doubts.
31.    The Trial Court has taken a reasonable view. There is no
substantial or compelling reasons for us to take any different view. In
Sheo Swarup vs. King Emperor, AIR 1934 PC 227, the Privy Council
held that despite their being no limitations on the exercise of the
power of the High Court in extensively reviewing the evidence on the
basis of which judgment of acquittal has been passed by the Trial
Court, certain basic principles are to be kept in mind while exercising
such jurisdiction, viz. giving of proper weight and consideration to (1)
the views of the Trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2)
the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused; (3) the right of
the accused to the benefit of any doubt; and (4) observing restraint in
disturbing the finding of fact arrived at by a Judge, who has observed
CRL.A.117/2014                                             Page 19 of 22

the demeanour of witnesses at the trial. These principles have been
reiterated in many subsequent decisions in Tulsiram Kanu vs. State,
AIR 1954 SC 1, Balbir Singh vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1957 SC 216,
M.G.Agarwal vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1963 SC 200, Khedu
Mohton vs. State of Bihar, (1970) 2 SCC 450, Sambasivan vs. State of
Kerala, (1998) 5 SCC 412, Bhagwan Singh vs. State of M.P (2002) 4
SCC 85 and State of Goa vs. Sanjay Thakran (2007) 3 SCC 755.
32.     In Chandrappa and Ors vs. State of Karnataka, 2007 (4) SCC
415, the law in this regard as been summed up and anthologized as
      “42. From the above decisions, in our considered view, the
      following general principles regarding powers of the
      appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an
      order of acquittal emerge:
           (1) An appellate court has full power to review, re-
           appreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the
           order of acquittal is founded.
           (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no
           limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such
           power and an appellate court on the evidence before it
           may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact
           and of law.
           (3) Various expressions, such as, "substantial and
           compelling reasons", "good and sufficient grounds",
           "very strong circumstances", "distorted conclusions",
           "glaring mistakes", etc. are not intended to curtail
CRL.A.117/2014                                              Page 20 of 22

         extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal
         against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the
         nature of "flourishes of language" to emphasise the
         reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with
         acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to
         review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion.
         (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that
         in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in
         favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of
         innocence is available to him under the fundamental
         principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person
         shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved
         guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the
         accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption
         of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and
         strengthened by the trial court.
         (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the
         basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court
         should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by
         the trial court.”
      A similar view has been expressed in Murugesan vs. State,
2012(10) SCC 383.
33.   We are thus of the considered opinion that no interference is
required with the impugned judgment of the Trial Court. We hereby
affirm and uphold the same.
34.   The appeal fails and is dismissed. The bail bonds are
cancelled/discharged.

35.   Trial Court record be returned forthwith.
