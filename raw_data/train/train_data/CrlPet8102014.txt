                              Crl. Pet. No. 810 of 2014
                                            BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
13.07.2017
              Heard Mr. Jyotirmoy Roy, learned counsel for the petitioners.
              Though notice was duly served on the sole respondent, he did not appear
    in the matter and the matter proceeded ex-parte.
              The petitioner No.1 is a Public Limited Company with its permanent office
    at Kolkata, West Bengal and the petitioner No. 4 is the Managing Director of the
    petitioner No.1 Company. The sole respondent was an agent of the petitioner No.
    1 Company who was entrusted and empowered to collect money from different
    depositors in the form of Fixed Deposits, Recurring Deposits and Monthly Income
    Schemes etc. in favour of and on behalf of the petitioner No.1 Company for
    issuing non-convertible preference shares. The petitioners and the sole
    respondent entered into an agreement wherein the petitioners agreed to pay a
    sum of Rs. 12,61,000/- in a deferred manner to the respondent to discharge its
    liabilities to the investors and for that purpose, three cheques bearing Nos. (i)
    751454 dated 25.09.2013 for a sum of Rs. 2,80,000/-; (ii) 751455 dated
    03.10.2013 for a sum of Rs. 4,61,000/- and (iii) 751453 dated 10.10.2013 for a
    sum of Rs. 5,20,000/-, all drawn on United Bank of India, Kolkata were issued to
    the sole respondent. The said respondent though deposited the cheques issued
    by the petitioner Company for encashment towards making payment of matured
    amounts to the depositors; but those three cheques issued by the petitioners
    were dishonoured due to ‘insufficient fund’. After complying with the formalities as
    required under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the sole respondent as a
    complainant on 27.10.2014 lodged a complaint before the Chief Judicial
    Magistrate, Dhubri against the petitioners for commission of offences under
    Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, as amended, read with
    Section 420/406 IPC, which was registered as C.R. Case No. 783c/2014. Learned
    Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri transferred the said C.R. Case to the Court of
    Crl. Ptn. No. 810 of 2016                                               Page 1 of 4

learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri for its disposal. Said Additional
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri after considering the affidavit on evidence filed
along with the complaint and after recording the statement of the complainant, by
his order dated 03.06.2014 passed in said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014, being prima
facie satisfied and finding materials against the petitioners/accused persons, took
cognizance of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act
against the petitioner Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and issued summons to them directing the
complainant/sole respondent to take steps on those accused persons/the present
petitioners, within a period of seven days. It is only when they received summons
in said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014, the petitioners could came to know about the
pendency of said case before the learned Additional CJM, Dhubri. Being aggrieved
with the same, the petitioners have preferred this criminal petition for quashing of
the proceedings in the said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014 stating that the learned Trial
Magistrate without making any enquiry as required under Section 202 Cr.P.C.,
took cognizance of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act and issued process against them.
         The provisions of Sections 202 Cr.P.C were amended by the Amendment
Act of 2005 making it mandatory to postpone the issue of process where the
accused resides in an area beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Magistrate
concerned as the same was found necessary in order to protect innocent persons
from being harassed by unscrupulous persons and making it obligatory upon the
Magistrate to enquire into the case himself or to direct investigation to be made
by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit for the purpose of
finding out whether or not there was sufficient ground against the accused before
issuing summons in such cases.
         The Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of National Bank of Oman -Vs-
Barakara Abdul Aziz, reported in (2013) 2 SCC 488 have held that the duty of a
Magistrate receiving a complaint is set out in Section 202 Cr.P.C. and there is an
obligation on the Magistrate to find out if there is any material which calls for
investigation by a criminal court. The scope of enquiry under this Section is
restricted only to find out the truth or otherwise the allegations made in the
complaint in order to determine whether process has to be issued or not.
Crl. Ptn. No. 810 of 2016                                                Page 2 of 4

Investigation under Section 202 Cr.P.C is different from the investigation
contemplated in Section 156 Cr.P.C as it is only for holding the Magistrate to
decide whether or not there is sufficient ground for him to proceed further. The
scope of enquiry under Section 202 Cr.P.C is, therefore, limited to the
ascertainment of truth or falsehood of the allegations made in the complaint – (i)
on the materials placed by the complainant before the Court, (ii) for the limited
purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case for issue of process has been
made out and for deciding the question purely from the point of view of the
complaint without at all adverting to any defence that the accused may have.
         From the complaint, it can be seen that all the accused person Nos. 1 to 4
in said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014 are resident from the State of West Bengal at
Kolkata and Howrah respectively and outside the jurisdiction of the court of
learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri. However, from the impugned
order dated 03.06.2014 passed by the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate
Dhubri in said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014, it is seen that the learned Magistrate
without making any mandatory enquiry as required under Section 202 Cr.P.C,
took cognizance of offence and issued process against the petitioners who are
residents of places outside the territorial jurisdiction of the learned Trial
Magistrate. Moreover, from the perusal of the impugned order also does not
reflect that the learned Trial Magistrate applied his judicious mind to the
requirement of mandatory enquiry under Section 202 Cr.P.C.
         As the impugned order dated 03.06.2014 passed by the learned Additional
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri in     said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014, that was
preferred by the complainant/sole respondent, is without any due application of
mind as to whether the mandatory enquiry under Section 202 Cr.P.C. in the said
case is required or not, where the Trial Magistrate, by the impugned order dated
03.06.2014, just considering the affidavit in evidence filed by the complainant
along with his complaint, took cognizance of the offences and issued summons to
the accused petitioners, the impugned order dated 03.06.2014 is bad in law.
         Considering the entire aspect of the matter and in exercise of the power
under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the Court is of the view that if the said impugned order
dated 03.06.2014 passed by the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Crl. Ptn. No. 810 of 2016                                               Page 3 of 4

Dhubri in said C.R. Case No. 783c/2014 is allowed to continue, it would be an
abuse of the process of the Court and accordingly, for the ends of justice, the
same is set aside and quashed.
         Further, the Trial Magistrate i.e. the learned Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Dhubri is hereby directed to reconsider the requirement of enquiry
under Section 202 Cr.P.C. in said complaint preferred by the complainant/sole
respondent herein being C.R. Case No. 783c/2014 and to pass a fresh and an
appropriate order in the said complaint case in accordance with law.
         With the aforesaid observation and direction, this criminal petition stands
allowed.
         The interim order passed earlier on 26.09.2014 stands merged with this
order.
                                                                   JUDGE
