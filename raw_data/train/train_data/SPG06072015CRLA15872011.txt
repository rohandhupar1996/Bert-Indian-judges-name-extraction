        CORAM:
        HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE S.P.GARG
S.P.Garg, J. (Oral)
1.           The appellant was convicted by a judgment dated 08.04.2011
of learned Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No. 20/2010
arising out of FIR No.100/2009 PS New Ashok Nagar. By an order dated
13.04.2011, he was awarded various prison terms with fine. Allegations
against the appellant were that Mohd. Talib lodged a complaint that her
daughter ‘X’ (assumed name) was missing since 31.03.2009 and did not
return from her school where she had gone at 11.00 a.m. to collect her

results. On 01.04.2009, ‘X’ was recovered from Sultanpuri and her
statement was recorded in which, she implicated the appellant for
kidnapping and committing rape upon her in the house of his sister-in-law.
The prosecution examined thirteen witnesses to establish the appellant’s
guilt before the Trial Court after charge-sheet was filed against him. In
313 Cr.P.C. statement, the appellant pleaded false implication and stated
that ‘X’ had accompanied with her free consent as she was in love with
him. He examined Renu as DW-1. The trial resulted in his conviction.
2.           The Trial Court came into conclusion that the prosecutrix
was below sixteen years of age and her consent was not material.
3.           During the course of appeal, nominal roll of the appellant
was called. As per nominal roll dated 04.07.2015, the appellant has
already served out the sentence awarded to him and has been released
from jail on 07.03.2015. Fine is stated to have been paid. Appellant’s
counsel has stated at Bar that after his release from jail, the appellant did
not contact him to get his appeal decided on merits. It appears that after
the appellant served the sentence and was released from jail, he was not
interested to prosecute the appeal and for that reason has not bothered to
appear in Court or to instruct his counsel for disposal of the appeal on
merits.
Crl.A.No.1587/2011                                                 Page 2 of 3

4.            In view of the above, the appeal preferred by the appellant
stands disposed of as ‘infructuous’. It is, however, made clear if the
appellant appears within a reasonable time for disposal of the appeal on
merits, his prayer will be considered.
5.            Pending application also stands disposed of.
6.            Trial Court record be sent back forthwith with the copy of the
order. A copy of the order be sent to the Superintendent Jail for
information.
