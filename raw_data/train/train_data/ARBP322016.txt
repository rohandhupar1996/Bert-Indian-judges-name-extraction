Arb. Petition No.32/2016                                                 Page 1 of 5

                       JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
           Heard Mr. J. Roy, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Mr. K.K.
Dey, learned counsel, appearing for the respondents.
2.         By this application filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, “1996 Act”), the petitioner prays for appointment of
an Arbitrator in respect of a dispute raised by him through his counsel vide letter
dated 08.08.2016.
3.         The dispute as raised by the petitioner in the said letter is a claim made
by the petitioner for interest @ 10% per annum on an amount of Rs.1,10,73,375/-
for the period from 01.02.2014 to 07.07.2015 till realization. The aforesaid amount
of Rs.1,10,73,375/- represents the amount being the difference of rent paid for the
aforesaid period and the new rate of rent, which came to be fixed on 02.07.2015.
4.         A lease deed was executed between the petitioner and the State Bank of
India (for short, “SBI”) on 30.03.2009 in respect of a building owned by the
petitioner. Amongst others, the lease agreement provided as follows:-
           “A.     For first floor 15000 sq. ft. @ Rs.12.50 per sq. ft. per month of the
           above premises for a term of 10 years from the date of handing over of
           site to the lessee/Bank with a provision to review the rent at the end of 5
           years not exceeding 25%.
           B.      For 7500 sq. ft. of Ground Floor offered for parking space @
           Rs.6.00 per sq. ft. per month of the above premises for a period of 10
           years with a provision to review the rent at the end of 5 years not
           exceeding 25% w.e.f. the date of lessee /Bank vacating the same portion
           of the Ground floor premises.
           C.      For 7500 sq. ft. Ground floor offered for Banking Hall @ Rs.9.25
           per sq. ft. per month for a period of 10 years with a provision to review
           the rent at the end of 5 years not exceeding 25% w.e.f. 01/02/2009.”
Arb. Petition No.32/2016                                                    Page 2 of 5

5.         Clause 22 of the said agreement also provided that the lessor would grant
to the lessee a renewal lease of the demised premises on the Bank’s written request
to be made before the expiration of the lease for such further period not exceeding
5(five) years on the same terms and conditions except increase of rent by mutual
consent.
6.         From the agreement aforesaid, it is apparent that the lease was for the
term of 10(ten) years with a provision of reviewing the rent at the end of 5(five)
years not exceeding 25%.
7.         On 10.12.2013, the petitioner wrote a letter to the respondent No.5
informing that the lease period would expire on 31.01.2014. It is stated therein that
as the earlier lease agreement was not registered, the terms and conditions
contained therein are null and void and, therefore, a fresh lease agreement w.e.f.
01.02.2014 may be arranged to be drawn at the revised rate of Rs.45/- per Sq. Ft.
for both ground and first floors.      Correspondence ensued between the parties
following the said letter.     In the meantime, the SBI continued to remain in
possession of the demised premises and it continued to pay the rent as before.
8.         Mr. Roy has submitted that in the letter dated 08.08.2016 demanding
arbitration, in Paragraph 3, it has been wrongly noted that rent was not paid till
07.07.2015.
9.         Subsequently, a lease agreement was entered into by and between the
parties on 02.07.2015, to be operative w.e.f. 01.02.2014. Recital is made in the
aforesaid lease agreement that the parties had entered into a fresh agreement
notwithstanding the lease agreement made earlier and that the parties are subject
to fresh terms and conditions and are not to be guided by previous lease agreement
and the terms and conditions mentioned therein. It is also provided for in the said
agreement that the previous agreement and the terms and conditions set forth
therein are not applicable to any of the parties, as the said agreement and the terms
and conditions set forth had expired and accordingly, the parties had entered into
Arb. Petition No.32/2016                                                 Page 3 of 5

the lease agreement before expiry of the earlier deed of lease on the terms and
conditions as appearing in the fresh agreement.
10.         It will be appropriate to refer to the rent payable under the agreement
dated 02.07.2015, which is as follows:
            “A.      For 7500 sq. ft. of Ground floor offered for parking space @
            Rs.20/- per sq. ft. per month of the above premises for a period of 10
            years with a provision to review the rent at the end of 5 years not
            exceeding 25% w.e.f. 01/02/2014.
            B.       For first floor 15000 sq. ft. @ Rs.40/- per sq. ft. per month of the
            above premises for a term of 10 years with a provision to review the rent
            at the end of 5 years not exceeding 25%.
            C.       For 7500 sq. ft. Ground floor offered for Banking Hall @ Rs.40/-
            per sq. ft. per month for a period of 10 years with a provision to review
            the rent at the end of 5 years not exceeding 25% w.e.f. 01.02.2014.”
11.         A bare look at the rent fixed would go to show that the rent was more
than 25% of the rent that was payable under the agreement dated 30.03.2009 in
respect of all the floors.
12.         With the execution of the aforesaid agreement dated 02.07.2015, the SBI
was liable to pay rent at the rate fixed under the agreement dated 02.07.2015 w.e.f.
01.02.2014.
13.         It is already noted that the Bank had continued to pay the rent in terms of
the earlier agreement dated 30.03.2009 during the interregnum period. The
differential amount on account of enhanced rent, which is the arrear amount as
claimed by the petitioner amounting to Rs.1,10,73,375/-, was paid by the SBI on
07.07.2015. The petitioner has raised the dispute claiming 10% interest on the
aforesaid amount for the period 01.02.2014 to 07.07.2015.
Arb. Petition No.32/2016                                                      Page 4 of 5

14.        In the lease agreement dated 02.07.2015, there was no stipulation that
the SBI would be liable to pay interest on the differential amount of rent w.e.f.
01.02.2014.
15.        In S.B.P. Company -Vs- Patel Engineering Limited & Anr.,
reported in (2005) 8 SCC 618, the Supreme Court had laid down that while
considering an application under Section 11 of the 1996 Act, the Chief Justice or his
nominee can decide the question as to whether a claim is dead one or a long-barred
claim was sought to be resurrected or whether the parties had concluded the
transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by
receiving the final payment without objection.
16.        Thus, while considering an application for appointment of Arbitrator, an
obligation is cast on the Court to ascertain as to whether there is an arbitrable
dispute between the parties.
17.        On a consideration of the materials on record and the terms and
conditions as finding place in the agreement dated 02.07.2015, I am of the
considered opinion that the parties had executed a fresh agreement of lease
recording their mutual rights and obligations and such agreement does not provide
for payment of any interest by the SBI for rent fixed from 01.02.2015. Thus, no
dispute had arisen under the agreement dated 02.07.2015.        In absence of any
arbitrable dispute, I am of the considered opinion that no case is made out for
appointment of an arbitrator.
18.        Accordingly, this application is dismissed.
                                                        JUDGE
