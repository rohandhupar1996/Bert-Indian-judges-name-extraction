S. K. SAHOO, J.           None appears on behalf of the petitioner.
                          The petitioner Pramila Acharya @ Lili has filed this
        application under section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to
        quash the impugned order dated 20.04.2005 passed by the
        learned J.M.F.C.(R), Cuttack in G.R. Case No.568 of 2004 in
        taking         cognizance            of      the       offences          under         sections

                                2
493/417/313/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code and issuance of
process against him. The said case arises out of Kishore Nagar
P.S. Case No.36 of 2004.
            The first information report was lodged by the victim
lady herself wherein she alleged that the co-villager Mahindra
Biswal gave assurance of marriage to her and kept physical
relationship for which she became pregnant and when she
conceived for about seven months, the said co-accused Mahindra
Biswal brought her to Cuttack in the pretext of registration of
marriage but took her to Jagannath Seva Sadan which is situated
at Nahabhanga, Biribati and there he compelled the victim lady
to abort her pregnancy and when the victim lady objected, the
accused Mahindra Biswal tried to convince her that his family
members would not accept her in such state and she would be
blamed in the neighbourhood and after the pregnancy is aborted,
he would marry her and take her to his house. In spite of such
assurance given by the accused Mahindra Biswal, since the
victim lady did not agree to terminate her pregnancy, she was
threatened and ultimately her pregnancy was terminated in
Jagannath Seva Sadan and the accused Mahindra Biswal left that
place and the staff of the Seva Sadan asked her to leave the
place and accordingly, she came back and disclosed the matter
to her family members and the gentlemen of the village tried to

                                 3
amicably settle the matter but the accused Mahindra Biswal did
not agree to marry the victim lady and ultimately the first
information report was lodged.
              Learned counsel for the State has produced the case
diary and he placed the first information report and the 161
Cr.P.C. statement of the victim lady as well as the charge sheet.
              On perusal of the materials available on record, it
prima facie reveals that the petitioner was serving in Jagannath
Seva Sadan, Nahabhanga, Biribati and the role attributed to her
is that when the doctor terminated the pregnancy of the victim
lady without her consent, she assisted the doctor and after
termination of pregnancy, both of them threatened the victim to
leave the place or else to face dire consequence. Even though
charge sheet has been submitted against the petitioner, inter
alia, for offences under sections 493 and 417 of the Indian Penal
Code, I find no prima facie materials to attract the ingredients of
such offences. On the other hand, there are prima facie
materials to attract the ingredients of offences under sections
313/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioner.
              Therefore, the impugned order dated 20.04.2005
relating taking of cognizance and issuance of process against the
petitioner for the offences under sections 419 and 417 of the
Indian Penal Code are concerned, stands quashed. So far as

                                    4
taking cognizance and issuance of process for the other offences
i.e. sections 313 and 506/34 of the Indian Penal Code are
concerned, the same stands confirmed.
                 Accordingly, the CRLMC application is allowed in part.
                                                  ..……………………….
