                                        WRIT APPEAL NO.174 of 2017
                                   BEFORE
              HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
22.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
       Mr.A Tewari and Ms. B Das, learned counsel for the appellant
       Mr.RKB Choudhury, learned Additional Senior Government
       Advocate, Assam for the respondents.
       Heard on admission.
       This intra court appeal has been filed by the appellant-Ismail
Ahmed-challenging the legality and validity of the impugned judgement
and order dated 30.3.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge in
appellant’s WP(C) No. 3805/2011, dismissing the writ petition.
2.     The appellant was the licencee of a fair price shop in the district of
Karimganj, Assam. Some people of the locality where his shop is situated
made a complaint on 27/6/2007 before the Superintendent, Food, Civil
Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Karimganj, alleging that he had
misappropriated the PDS materials and thus illegally deprived the
consumers. On receipt of the said complaint, an enquiry was initiated and
the Enquiry Officer visited his shop on 28/6/2007 and 29/6/2007. But on
both the dates, the shop was found to be closed. However, the Enquiry
Officer submitted his report on 30/6/2007 confirming illegalities having
been committed by the appellant. It may be mentioned herein that
according to appellant, he was sick on the above mentioned two days
due to which the shop was kept closed. Be that as it may, on receipt of
the aforesaid enquiry report, Respondent No. 4 suspended the licence of
the appellant on 7/7/2007 and subsequently a show-cause notice was
issued to him on 23/8/2007 seeking his explanation as to why
                                                              Page 1 of 4

appropriate action should not be taken against him. Appellant submitted
his reply stating inter alia that on 28/6/2007 and 29/6/2007 he was
hospitalised in Primary Mini Health Centre and therefore he could not
open the shop. Reply was not found to be satisfactory and his licence was
cancelled on the basis of the enquiry report. Being aggrieved, appellant
filed an appeal under section 29(1) (b) of the Assam Public Distribution of
Article Order, 1982 before the Deputy Commissioner, Karimganj, who
vide order dated 15/9/2007, upheld the order of cancellation of licence.
3.      Appellant then filed WP(C) No. 5752/2010 and this Court vide
order dated 10/1/2011 set aside the order of cancelling his licence on the
ground that he was not served with the copy of enquiry report. But the
court also directed the respondent authorities to initiate fresh proceeding
by issuing notice to him and to take a decision on the matter after giving
reasonable opportunity of hearing. Pursuant to the said order show cause
notice was again issued to the appellant on 17/2/2011 wherein it was
mentioned that on 28/6/2007 and 29/6/2007 the shop was closed and
hence the Enquiry Officer did not get the opportunity to inspect the
stocks and sales accounts in the fair price shop. Appellant was also asked
to explain anomalies appearing in the stock book and sales accounts
maintained by him regarding Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) rice on
14/4/2007, 15/4/2007 and 16/4/2007 and the same does not tally with
the sales shown in the stock book against the aforesaid dates and there
were discrepancies in respect of 33 kgs of rice too. Apart from that, he
was also asked to show cause on the anomaly found in sales accounts of
the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) rice with the scheme and quantities of
rice issued to the appellant and the stock and sales account of superior
kerosene oil (SK Oil) which did not tally with the supplies made to
appellant.
4.      Appellant submitted his reply on 2/3/2011 wherein he stated that
on the aforesaid dates his shop was closed as he was hospitalised and in
support of the same he produced one medical certificate. The Deputy
                                                               Page 2 of 4

Director, in-charge, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Karimganj,
came to the conclusion that the medical certificate dated 10/7/2007
produced by the appellant merely revealed that he was advised to take
rest from 28/6/2007 to 29/6/2007 and he was certified to be fit from
30/6/2007 and the said certificate does not support the contention of
appellant that on aforesaid dates he was required to be hospitalised in
the primary health Centre. It was also observed that appellant could not
satisfactorily explain the discrepancies regarding the BPL Rice, AAY Rice
as well as kerosene and the same was recorded in his order dated
28/3/2011. On appeal made by the appellant, Deputy Commissioner vide
order dated 14/6/2011 upheld the order of cancelling the licence by a
speaking order after hearing the appellant in person.
5.      Being aggrieved, appellant again preferred aforesaid WP(C)
No.3805/2011, which has been dismissed by the learned Single Judge
and hence this appeal. After hearing the learned counsel for the
appellant, we are of the considered view that the appeal has no merit
and deserves to be dismissed. We say so because appellant was asked to
show cause as to why there were discrepancies regarding the supplies of
BPL Rice, AAY Rice as well as kerosene since supply of said commodities
did not tally with the stock book maintained on those three (3) dates. But
appellant gave an evasive reply and as such failed to satisfy the
authorities. Appellant did not also specifically explain as to why the
anomalies took place and he also did not take any step to prove his
innocence that he did not violate any condition of the licence. Besides, as
regards his contention that he was hospitalised on when the enquiry
officer the dates when the Enquiry Officer visited his shop also remained
unsupported since he could not produce any authentic document/proof to
support his contention. Besides, there is no provision for hospitalisation in
Primary Health Centres and treatments are provided to the needy as
outdoor patients only.      He merely produced one medical certificate
wherein it was mentioned that he was advised to take rest on the
                                                              Page 3 of 4

aforesaid dates. Besides, the Deputy Commissioner afforded the appellant
adequate opportunity of hearing while upholding the decision of the
Respondent No. 2 in cancelling the licence of the appellant.
6.     In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed summarily.
