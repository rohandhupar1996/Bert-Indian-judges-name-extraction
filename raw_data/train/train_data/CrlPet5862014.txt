                              Crl. Pet. No. 586 of 2014
                                           BEFORE
                  HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Budha Gogoi learned counsel for the petitioners. Also heard Mr.
    T.K. Misra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam appearing for the State.
             The respondent No. 2/aggrieved woman/applicant in spite of receipt of
    notice did not appear and hence this matter proceeded exparte against her.
             On 18.03.2014 the respondent No. 2 filed an application before the learned
    Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Jonai under Section 12 of the Protection of
    Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 against the present petitioners being
    Misc. Case No. 7/2014, wherein it is alleged by her that the petitioner No. 1 herein
    married her in the year 2004 as per the rites and rituals of the Missing community
    and that on 11.08.2004 both the petitioner No. 1 and she entered into a marriage
    agreement before the Sub-Registrar, Jonai; but after a few days of their said
    marriage, at the instigation of the present petitioner No. 1, the petitioner Nos. 2
    and 3 and the petitioner No. 1 together started torturing her mentally and
    physically and that on 26.05.2007 the petitioner No. 1 left her.
             The respondent No. 2/aggrieved woman in her said application under the
    Domestic Violence Act, 2005 before the SDJM, Jonai stated that since 26.05.2007,
    she is living in her parental home as her husband, the petitioner No. 1 herein left
    her and prayed for granting her maintenance of Rs. 2,000/- per month and to
    provide her land and house with similar amenities as that of the petitioner No. 1
    where she can live safely and further, compensation of Rs. 10 Lakhs for physical
    and mental harassment caused upon her as provided under Section 22 of the said
    2005 Act.      She also prayed before the said Trial Magistrate to grant her Rs.
    50,000/- as interim relief under Section 23 of the said 2005 Act.
             Upon hearing the aggrieved woman/respondent No.2 and on perusal of the
    report, the JMFC, Jonai by his order dated 23.05.2014 passed in said Misc. Case
    No. 7/2014, on its own, came to a finding that the petitioners have treated
    Crl. Pet. No. 586 of 2014                                                Page 1 of 4

respondent No. 2/aggrieved woman with cruelty and directed the petitioner No. 1
to pay her an amount of Rs. 3,000/- per month as interim measure until further
order.
         The petitioners being aggrieved with the said order of the SDJM, Jonai
dated 23.05.2014 passed in said Misc. Case No. 7/2014 have preferred this criminal
petition for quashing and setting aside the same as well as the proceeding of said
Misc. Case No. 7/2014 under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act, 2005, stating that the said aggrieved woman/respondent No.2 mis-
represented the fact before the Court since prior to the filing of the said application
on 18.03.2014 being Misc. Case No. 7/2014, the said aggrieved woman/respondent
No. 2 earlier lodged an FIR on 18.08.2007 before the Jonai Police Station against
the present petitioner No. 1, which was registered as Jonai P.S. Case No. 86/2007
under Section 498-A IPC corresponding to G.R. Case No. 86/2007 and after filing of
the Chargesheet in the case, on completion of the trial of said case, the Trial
Magistrate, i.e. the Court of learned SDJM (M), Jonai dated 24.12.2013 came to the
finding that in said G.R. Case No. 86/2007 (arising out of Jonai P.S. Case No.
86/2007) the prosecution failed to bring the charge under Section 498-A IPC
against the alleged accused, husband of the informant, the present petitioner No.1
beyond all reasonable doubt and as such said Trial Court i.e. the Court of SDJM
(M), Jonai acquitted the petitioner No.1 from all the charge under Section 498-A
IPC and set him at liberty forthwith.
         The petitioners also brought to the notice of this Court that the said
aggrieved woman/respondent No. 2 earlier on 26.11.2007 filed            an application
under Section 125 Cr.P.C., being Misc. Case No. 20/2007 before the learned
SDJM(M), Jonai for getting maintenance of Rs. 2 Lakhs in terms of marriage
agreement between her and the petitioner No.1 and after hearing both the said
applicant/aggrieved woman/the respondent No. 2 herein and the petitioner No.1,
the learned SDJM (M), Jonai by his judgment dated 24.10.2013 came to the finding
that the applicant/respondent No. 2 is neither a legally married wife of the
petitioner No. 1 nor a wife within the meaning of Section 125 Cr.P.C. and therefore
said applicant/aggrieved woman/respondent No. 2 is not entitled to get
maintenance from the petitioner No. 1.
Crl. Pet. No. 586 of 2014                                                  Page 2 of 4

         Mr. Gogoi, learned counsel for the petitioners also submits that the
respondent No. 2 did not place these facts in her application dated 18.03.2014
before the learned Court below, i.e. before the learned SDJM, Jonai in said Misc.
Case No. 7/2014 while filing the application under Section 12 of the 2005 Act nor
preferred any appeal against the said Judgment and Order dated 24.12.2013
passed in G.R. Case No. 86/2007 as well as the Judgment dated 24.10.2013 passed
in Misc. Case No. 20/2007 by the learned SDJM(M), Jonai and as such learned
Magistrate wrongly took cognizance of the case under the said 2005 Act and issued
process against the petitioner directing him to pay an amount of Rs.3,000/- as
monthly maintenance to the respondent No.2.
         The Court in this proceeding on 06.08.2014 while issuing notice to the
respondents, in the interim, suspended the proceeding of said Misc. Case No.
07/2014 under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,
2005 pending before SDJM (M), Jonai, which is still in force.
         It is seen from the above that the respondent No. 2 in her application dated
18.03.2014 made under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act, 2005 pertaining to said Misc. Case No. 7/2014 suppressed the
aforesaid facts before the learned SDJM, Jonai. Moreover, it is also noticed that the
SDJM (M), Jonai after going through the evidence on record by its order dated
24.12.2013 passed in the proceeding of G.R. Case No. 86/2007 arising out of Jonai
P.S. Case No. 86/2007 acquitted the petitioner No. 1 beyond all reasonable doubt
from the charge of the offence under Section 498-A IPC that was raised by the
respondent No. 2 setting him at liberty. Again the Court of SDJM (M), Jonai after
hearing the parties and going through the evidence on record by its Judgment
dated 24.10.2013 passed in Misc. Case No. 20/2007 came to a finding that the
respondent No. 2 herein is not a legally married wife of the petitioner No. 1 and not
entitled to any maintenance under Section 125 CrPC from the petitioner No. 1, as
claimed by her and both the decisions of the said Court being not challenged till
date in any higher forum nor been set aside by any higher Court of law, by efflux of
time has become absolute. It is also seen that after failing in both the aforesaid
proceedings under Section 498-A IPC and under Section 125 CrPC; the respondent
No. 2, thereafter, on 18.03.2014 approached the SDJM, Jonai against the petitioner
Crl. Pet. No. 586 of 2014                                                 Page 3 of 4

taking recourse to Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence
Act, 2005 in said Misc. Case No. 7/2014 Act claiming almost similar benefits as
claimed in the aforesaid two proceedings.
         For the reasons above, if the proceeding of said Misc. Case No. 07/2014
under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
Act, on the basis of the application dated 18.03.2014 filed by the respondent No. 2,
if allowed to continue, the Court is of the view that it would be an abuse of the
process of the Court of law and harassment to the petitioners. As such, for the
interest of justice, in exercise of the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the
proceeding of said Misc. Case No. 7/2014 along with the application under Section
12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 dated 18.03.2014
that was preferred by the respondent No. 2 against the petitioners herein, pending
before learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Jonai is set aside and quashed.
         The interim order dated 06.08.2014 passed earlier in this proceeding stands
merged with this order.
         Accordingly, this criminal petition stands allowed.
                                                                    JUDGE
