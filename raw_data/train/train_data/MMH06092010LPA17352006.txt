LPA 1735/2006                                                                 Page 1 of 4

LPA 1735/2006 & CM 10748/2006
1.     Present Letters Patent Appeal has been filed challenging the
judgment and order dated 17th January, 2006 passed in W.P.(C)
2004/1997 whereby the learned Single Judge has quashed the
appellant’s demand towards misuse charges raised upon the respondent
for allegedly running a guest house. By virtue of the said order, a
mandamus was also issued to appellant-DDA to consider and process
the conversion application filed by the respondent in accordance with
law.
2.     On 10th March, 2008, learned counsel for appellant-DDA had
stated before this Court that two other Letters Patent Appeals being
LPA No.1576/2005 titled Union of India vs. Sh. Manvinder Singh Vedi
and LPA No.2642/2005 titled Union of India vs. Anu Mehra involving
similar issues were pending consideration in this Court. Since on the
said date of hearing the learned counsel for appellant-DDA had also
pointed out that the aforesaid two LPAs had been adjourned sine die in
view of pendency of Special Leave Petition No. 6624/2005 wherein
also the issue relating to levy of misuse charges on running of guest
house was pending before the Supreme Court, the present case was
adjourned sine die with liberty to learned counsel for the parties to get it
revived once the Special Leave Petition was disposed of.
3.     Admittedly, on 18th February, 2010, the aforesaid Special Leave
Petition No.6624/2005 was dismissed. However, the Apex Court left
LPA 1735/2006                                                    Page 2 of 4

the question of law open for decision in some other case. Subsequent to
the Supreme Court’s order, LPA No.1576/2005 and LPA 2642/2005
were also dismissed by this Court in terms of the Division Bench
judgment in Union of India vs. Vinay Kumar Agarwal (LPA
696/2004), which led to the filing of Special Leave Petition
No.6624/2005. Order dated 22nd April, 2010 of the Division Bench
dismissing LPA No. 1576/2005 is reproduced hereinbelow:-
      “The Appellant is aggrieved by an order dated 4 th
      February, 2005 passed by a learned Single Judge in
      W.P.(C) No.7642/2001. A perusal of the impugned
      judgment and order indicates that the learned Single Judge
      followed the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in
      the case of Vinay Kumar Agarwal (LPA No.696/2004
      decided on 7th January, 2005). On 7th March, 2006, it was
      stated by learned counsel for the Appellant that a similar
      matter is pending before the Supreme Court and therefore
      the present LPA was adjourned sine die and the impugned
      judgment and order was stayed.
      The Registry has now informed us that in fact an Special
      Leave Petition was filed against the judgment of the
      Division Bench being Civil Appeal No.1364/2006 (Union
      of India vs. Vinay Kumar Agarwal). That Civil Appeal was
      disposed of by the Supreme Court on 18th February, 2010
      on which date the following order was passed:
           We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned
           judgments of the High Court. We however, leave
           the question of law that has been raised by the
           ASG, open for decision in some other case. With
           this observation the appeal is dismissed.
      Since the decision of this Court in LPA no.696/2004
      decided on 7th January, 2005 has not been interfered with,
      this appeal is dismissed in terms of that decision.”
4.    The matter was thereafter repeatedly adjourned for the learned
counsel for the appellant-DDA to take instruction as to whether due to
change in policy, anything survived in the present appeal.

5.     Today, Ms. Sangeeta Chandra, learned counsel for appellant-
DDA submitted that she had received instructions to contest the matter
on merits. When it was pointed out to Ms. Chandra that on her own
statement the controversy in the present appeal was similar to LPA
No.1576/2005 and LPA 2642/2005 which have now been dismissed,
Ms. Chandra submitted that in view of the Supreme Court leaving the
question of law open in SLP No.6624/2005, we should reconsider the
issue.
6.     However, we are of the view that we are bound by the Division
Bench judgment in the case of Union of India vs. Vinay Kumar
Agarwal (supra) as well as the coordinate Bench’s order dated 22nd
April, 2010 in LPA No.1576/2005 which has been reproduced
hereinabove.
7.     Consequently, following the judgment of the coordinate Division
Bench in LPA No.1576/2005, we dismiss the present appeal.
