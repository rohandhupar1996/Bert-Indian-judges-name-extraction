       HC KARTAR SINGH                                        ..... Petitioner
                           Through: Mr. Kedar Nath Tripathy, Advocate
                           versus
       UNION OF INDIA & ORS.                                  ..... Respondents
                           Through: Mr. Vivek Goyal, CGSC with
                           Mr. Prabhakar Srivastav, Advocate
       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE HIMA KOHLI
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR
                           ORDER
       %                   01.04.2016
1.     The present petition has been filed by the petitioner, who was working
on the post of a Head Constable (GD) in the respondents/ITBP in the year
2002, praying inter alia for directions to the respondents to designate and
treat him as a Head Security Guard at the Indian Embassy at Kabul, where
he was deputed between 07.11.2002 to 08.10.2005, and pay him Foreign
Allowance commensurate to his rank of Head Constable.
2.     Stated precisely, the facts of the case are that the petitioner was one of
the 36 ITBP personnel, who were deployed in the Indian Embassy at Kabul
in the years 2003-2005. Vide order dated 20.01.2002, the petitioner
alongwith other ITBP personnel was appointed as a Security Guard,
temporarily sanctioned for the Embassy of India at Kabul, as a part of a 36
member contingent deployed for the security of the India Mission in Kabul.
Pertinently, neither the petitioner, nor the respondents have placed on record
WP(C) 23053/2005                                               Page No.1 of 4

a copy of the Administrative Order dated 20.01.2002. However, it is an
undisputed position that the said order had stated that the Foreign Allowance
shall be admissible to the petitioner as is admissible to an India based
Security Guard.
3.     The dispute in the present case hinges on the extent of the entitlement
of Foreign Allowance to the petitioner. It is the stand of the petitioner that
while he was appointed to the post of a Head Constable, when deputed at the
Indian Embassy at Kabul, he was being paid Foreign Allowance as is
admissible to a Constable, which is contrary to the recommendations made
by the Counsellor posted at the Indian Embassy in Kabul. In support of the
said submission, counsel for the petitioner had drawn our attention to the
letter dated 03.11.2004, addressed by the Counsellor attached to the Indian
Embassy at Kabul to the Joint Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, New
Delhi, wherein it was requested that Head Constables be equated with non-
gazetted officials for the purpose of payment of Foreign Allowance.
4.     When the present case was taken up for hearing on 14.03.2016,
counsel for the petitioner had stated that the decision taken by the Ministry
of External Affairs on the recommendations made by the Counsellor posted
at Indian Embassy in Kabul had not been placed on record despite a detailed
order dated 19.03.2007, whereunder the respondents were directed to secure
the relevant records and state as to whether the proposal/recommendations
received from the Embassy in Kabul had been examined by the Government
of India and the decision, if any, taken thereon.
5.     Vide order dated 14.03.2016, counsel for the respondents was directed
to obtain necessary instructions from the Department. Subsequently, on
28.03.2016, counsel for the respondents had handed over a copy of the letter
WP(C) 23053/2005                                             Page No.2 of 4

dated 03.04.2007, addressed by the Ministry of External Affairs to the
respondents/ITBP, which was taken on record. A copy thereof has been
furnished to the counsel for the petitioner. As per the said letter, while
making a reference to the present petition, the Joint Secretary (Personnel),
Ministry of External Affairs, UOI had informed the ITBP that the
communication dated 03.11.2004 received from the Counsellor posted at the
Indian Embassy in Kabul had been examined by the Ministry in detail but
the request for grant of Foreign Allowance, to the ITBP Head Constables
deployed in the Embassy of India at Kabul equivalent to that being paid to
non-gazetted officials, was found to be unjustified on the ground that there
was no post of a Head Security Guard ever sanctioned for the Embassy of
India in Kabul and the petitioner herein had been posted as a Security Guard
against one of the posts of Security Guards sanctioned by the Ministry of
External Affairs on 31.10.2002. It was further clarified that the petitioner
was drawing his pay in the scale of Rs.3200-4900, which is closer to the
scale of Rs.3050-4590, whereas the lowest level of Assistant Personnel and
Welfare Officer (AP&WO) is that of Assistant Sub-Inspector, whose scale
of pay is Rs.4000-6000, which is equated with the basic category of non-
gazetted officials of the Ministry comprising of Assistants/Personal
Assistants/Clerks/Stenographers. The petitioner, who was Head Constable
with the ITBP, was given the rank of a Security Guard when posted to the
Embassy of India, Kabul and resultantly, was being paid Foreign Allowance,
as was applicable to Security Guards.
6.     As far as the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the
petitioner was entitled to Foreign Allowance as was being paid to a Head
Constable of the ITBP at the Indian Embassy at Colombo, it has been
WP(C) 23053/2005                                          Page No.3 of 4

averred in para 8 of the counter affidavit filed by the respondents, that in the
Embassy of India at Colombo, there was a post of a Head Security Guard
whereas in the Embassy of India at Kabul, there was no such post and only
the post of Security Guards had been sanctioned. It has been stated that
creation of ranks in the mission is a discretionary power of the Union of
India exercised in consultation with the Ambassador after considering
various factors prevalent in the country in question and merely because the
Head Constable posted in the Embassy of India at Colombo was being paid
Foreign Allowance, would not entitle the petitioner, who was posted as a
Security Guard at the Embassy of India at Kabul, to extension of the same
benefit.
7.     In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and having regard to
the explanation offered by the Ministry of External Affairs in its letter dated
03.04.2007, which has now come on record, we do not find any merit in the
present petition, which is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.
