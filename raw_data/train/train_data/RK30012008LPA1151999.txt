%                              30.01.2008
:      DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)
1.        The present appeal arises out of the civil writ petition filed by the
respondent which was allowed by a learned Single Judge of this Court by the
order dated 16th October, 1998. While doing so, the learned Single Judge relied
upon an earlier decision of a Single Bench in CW No.3790/1995.                  In the
impugned judgment and order, the learned Single Judge held that the respondents
who were writ petitioners before the learned Single Judge would be entitled to the
pay scale of Rs.1640-2900/- effective from 01.01.1986 as such a pay scale is
being provided to the Assistants/Stenographers Gr.'C' working in the Central
Secretariat Service.
2.     The writ petition was filed in this Court with the issue as to whether the
        LPA 115/1999                                            Page 1 of 7

Stenographers and Assistants working in the National Productivity Council are
entitled to the similar pay scale of Rs.1640-2900/- which has been given to the
Assistants/Stenographers Gr.'C' working in the Central Secretariat Service in view
of the recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission. Pay scale of such persons
working in the Central Secretariat Services (CSS) prior to 1st January, 1986 was
Rs.425-800/- (pre-revised). However, on the recommendations of the Fourth
Central Pay Commission, the aforesaid pay scale was revised to Rs.1400-2600/-.
It is needless to mention that the recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission
were not automatically applicable to the employees of the Public Sector
Undertakings (PSUs), but many such autonomous bodies and PSUs adopted those
recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission and gave parity of pay scales to
their employees working in similar cadre.
3.      The Assistants and Stenographers of the National Productivity Council
were also given a pay scale of Rs.1400-2600/-. However, the Government issued
Office Memorandum (O.M.) on 31st July, 1990 whereby it granted pay scale of
Rs.1640-2900/- to the Assistants/Stenographers Gr.'C' working in the CSS.
Contending, inter alia, that the nature and duties performed by the Stenographers
and Assistants of the National Productivity Council are similar to those of the
Assistants and Stenographers Gr.'C' working in the CSS and also that the
Government's Office Memorandum dated 31st July, 1990 would also be applicable
to the case of those employees working as the Stenographers and Assistants of
National Productivity Council and they would be entitled to a parity of pay scale
of Rs.1640-2900/-, the respondents filed a writ petition.
4.      The Office Memorandum issued by the Government of India on 31st July,
1990 also stipulates that the aforesaid revised pay scale would also be applicable
        LPA 115/1999                                           Page 2 of 7

to the Assistants/Stenographers in other organizations like the Ministry of
External Affairs, which are not participating in the CSS subject to fulfillment of
certain conditions.     In the light of the aforesaid stipulations in the Office
Memorandum, claim was raised by the employees of the National Productivity
Council belonging to the grade of Stenographers and Assistants claiming the same
pay scale of Rs.1640-2900/-. Since the same was not made available, hence the
writ petition was filed in this Court by the respondents herein, which was
registered as WP No.4040/1996.
5.       At this stage, we must point out that the Assistants of many such
PSUs/autonomous organizations, who were in the previous pay scale of Rs.425-
800/- and were given the pay scale of Rs.1400-2600/- started claiming the same
pay scale as that of the Central Secretariat Service, that is, Rs.1640-2900/- on the
ground that they are entitled to the benefit of O.M. dated 31st July, 1990 as they
fulfill the conditions prescribed therein. Some such writ petitions were allowed by
the Single Benches after hearing those writ petitions. One of such petition was
CW No.3790/1995 which was allowed. Following the decision rendered therein,
the writ petition out of which the present appeal arises was also disposed of by
order allowing the writ petition dated 16th October, 1998.
6.       Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the present appeal was filed by the
National Productivity Council challenging the legality of the aforesaid order dated
16.10.1998. Counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted before us that all
the writ petitions which involve the similar issues became subject matter of appeal
and were decided by a common judgment on 31st May, 2002 in L.P.A.
No.271/1971. The Division Bench disposed of all those appeals holding that the
Assistants of the Public Sector Undertakings and Autonomous Bodies were not
         LPA 115/1999                                             Page 3 of 7

entitled to the revised pay scale of Rs.1640-2900/-. As against the aforesaid order,
as it appears, and some other cases, review petition was filed in this Court, which
was considered in the case of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan vs. Kendriya
Vidyalaya Sangathan Staff Association and other connected matters. The said
cases were disposed of by order dated 18.12.2003 whereby the Division Bench of
this Court dismissed the review application and upheld the common judgment and
order dated 31st May, 2002 passed by the Division Bench holding that those
Assistants of the PSUs and autonomous bodies were not entitled to revised pay
scale of Rs.1640-2900/-. Therefore, the said order passed by the Division Bench
has become binding so far this Court is concerned.
7.      We may, at this stage, also refer to a decision of the Supreme Court in
Union of India vs. Tarit Ranjan Das reported in (2003) 11 SCC 658. In the said
case, the Supreme Court was called upon to answer a similar issue as raised in the
present appeal. The facts of the said case before the Supreme Court were that the
respondent working as Stenographer Grade II in the Office of Geological Survey
of India, submitted a representation before the Deputy Director General, GSI,
Shillong seeking parity of pay scale with that of Stenographer Grade 'C' of the
Central Secretariat. A view was taken by the Union of India in that case that
Stenographer Grade II is not in comparable grade with Stenographer Grade 'C' in
the Central Secretariat and according to it, services in Stenographer Grade 'C' in
the Central Secretariat belong to Grade 'B' whereas Stenographer Grade II in
Geological Survey of India are classified as Grade 'C' (Ministerial). In the said
case also, when the claim was raised for parity of pay scale of the aforesaid
Assistants/Stenographers working in the Geological Survey of India with that of
Assistants/Stenographers     Gr.'C' of    the  Central   Secretariat,  the  Central
        LPA 115/1999                                            Page 4 of 7

Administrative Tribunal before whom the petition was filed seeking the relief of
parity initially dismissed the same, but in a review petition, the Tribunal held that
all the relevant facts were not placed before the Central Pay Commission and that
it had not given any reason as to why different scales were to be fixed. It was also
held by the Tribunal that the nature of work, duties and responsibilities of the two
categories of Stenographers clearly indicate that the relevant aspects were not
considered by the Commission and it proceeded on a different basis and held that
the Stenographer Grade II should be placed in a same pay scale of Stenographer
Gr.'C' of the Central Secretariat. The Division Bench of the High Court upheld
the said judgment of the Tribunal.         Both the Tribunal and the High Court
judgments were set aside by the Supreme Court, holding that the equality is not
based on designation or the nature of work alone and that there are several other
factors like responsibilities, reliabilities, experience, confidentiality involved,
functional need and requirements commensurate with the position in the hierarchy
as also the qualification required which were equally relevant. The Supreme
Court referred to its earlier decisions in State of Haryana vs. Tilak Raj reported in
(2003) 6 SCC 123 and Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology vs. Manoj
K. Mohanty reported in (2003) 5 SCC 188 as also the case of State Bank of India
vs. M.R. Ganesh Babu reported in (2002) 4 SCC 556. The Supreme Court also
referred to paragraph 46.34 of the report of the Fifth Pay Commission, which
states as follows:
           “46.34.       We have given our careful consideration to the
           suggestions made by associations representing Stenographers
           in offices outside the Secretariat in the light of observations
           made by the Third CPC. The Commission had observed that as
           a general statement, it was correct to say that the basic nature
           of a Stenographer's work remained by and large the same
           whether he was working with an officer in the Secretariat or
           with an officer in a subordinate office. The Commission was of
         LPA 115/1999                                            Page 5 of 7

          the considered view that the size of the Stenographer's job was
          very much dependent upon the nature of work entrusted to that
          officer and that it would not be correct, therefore, to go merely
          by the status in disregard of the functional requirement. By the
          very nature of work in the Secretariat, the volume of dictation
          and typing work was expected to be heavier than in a
          subordinate office, the requirement of secrecy even in civil
          offices of the Secretariat could be very stringent. Considering
          the differences in the hierarchical structures and in the type of
          work transacted, the Commission was not in favour of adopting
          a uniform pattern in respect of matter listed in the preceding
          paragraph. To our mind, the observations of the Third CPC
          are as relevant today as they were at that point of time and we
          are not inclined to overlook them totally. In view of the
          abovementioned distinguishable feature, we do not concede the
          demand for absolute parity in regard to pay scales between
          Stenographers in offices outside the Secretariat and in the
          Secretariat notwithstanding the fact that some petitioner
          Stenographers, Grade II have got other benefits of parity in
          pay scale through courts. However, pursuing the policy
          enunciated by the Second CPC that disparity in the pay scale
          prescribed for Stenographers in the Secretariat and the non-
          Secretariat organizations should be reduced as far as possible,
          we are of the view that Stenographers, Grade II should be
          placed in the existing pay scale of Rs.1600-2660 instead of
          Rs.1400-2300/Rs.1400-2600.”
8.     Thereafter, referring to its earlier decision in State of U.P. vs. J.P.
Chaurasia reported in (1989) 1 SCC 121 wherein it was stated by the Supreme
Court that whether two posts are equal or should carry equal pay depends on
several factors and does not depend upon either the nature of work or the volume
of work done, and that whether there could be a parity of pay could not be
determined by relying upon averments in affidavits of interested parties and must
be determined by expert bodies like Pay Commission or the Government, who
would be the best judges, to evaluate the nature of duty, responsibility and all
relevant factors, the Supreme Court in the case of Tarit Ranjan Das (supra)
allowed the appeal.
9.     In the case of Shyam Babu Verma vs. Union of India reported in (1994) 2
SCC 521, it was stated that a claim for equal pay by a group of pharmacists was
        LPA 115/1999                                              Page 6 of 7

rejected saying that the classification made by a body of experts after full study
and analysis of the work, should not be disturbed except for strong reasons which
indicate that the classification made was unreasonable. This decision was also
referred to and relied upon in the case of Tarit Ranjan Das (supra).
10.    In our considered opinion, in view of the Division Bench decision in LPA
No.271/1997, which is also upheld in the order passed on 18.12.2003 on the
review application, and the aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Tarit Ranjan Das and other similar cases referred to above, there is merit in this
appeal. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and
order    passed    by    the   learned    Single   Judge   and    hold     that  the
Stenographers/Assistants of National Productivity Council cannot get the pay
scale of Rs.1640-2900/- in lieu of Rs.1400-2600/- effective from 01.01.1986.
They shall be entitled only to the aforesaid pay scale of Rs.1400-2600/- effective
from 01.01.1986.
11.    In terms of the aforesaid order, the appeal is allowed leaving the parties to
bear their own costs.
