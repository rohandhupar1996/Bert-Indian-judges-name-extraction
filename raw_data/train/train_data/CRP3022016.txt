                           THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
     (THE HIGH COURT OF ASSAM, NAGALAND, MIZORAM & ARUNACHAL PRADESH)

                           Sri Ganesh Das                     … Petitioners
                                -Versus-
                           Sri Bhaskar Deb and others         ..Respondents
                                       BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE KALYAN RAI SURANA
     Advocates for the Petitioner        : Mr. PK Roy,
                                                Advs.
     Advocates for the Respondents       : Mr. S.D. Purakayastha, Adv.
     Date of hearing                     : 08.06.2017
     Date judgment                       : 19.06.2017
                               JUDGMENT AND ORDER
     1)            Heard Mr. PK Roy, the learned counsel for the petitioner
     and Mr. SD Purkayastha, the learned counsel for the respondents.
     2)            By filing this revision application under Article 227 of the
     Constitution of India, the petitioner, who is the plaintiff in Test Suit No.
     35/2000 pending before the learned court of Additional District Judge
     (FTC), Cachar, Silchar has challenged the order dated 24.03.2016
     passed by the said learned court. By the said order, the said learned
     court has expunged the evidence on affidavit filed by the PW.3,
     namely, Bimal Namasudra, as he had expired on 24.11.2005.
CRP No.302 of 2016                                                           Page 1 of 7

     By the said order, it was held that the said learned trial court did not
     find any ground to allow the amendment of the plaint. The suit was
     then fixed on 16.07.2016 for cross examination of DW.1
     3)             Owing to the nature of dispute raised in the present
     application, I do not deem it fit to burden this judgment with the
     pleadings of the parties before the learned trial court.
     4)             The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that
     the petitioner /plaintiff’s side had submitted the evidence on affidavit of
     4 witnesses on 15.09.2004 and the case was fixed for cross
     examination of the witnesses on 13.10.2004. However, on 13.10.2004,
     the respondent or the defendants prayed for an adjournment and, as
     such, the case was then fixed on 2.12.2004 for cross examination of
     PWs. On 2.12.2004, the petitioner’s side was present in Court with 3
     PWs including the PW.3, Bimal Sutradar.            Despite objection by the
     petitioner’s side, the learned trial court allowed the petition for
     adjournment and the case was fixed on 4.1.2005 for cross examination
     of PWs. On 4.1.2005, the petitioner’s side was again present before
     the    court   with  3     witnesses   including    PW.3    but   again  the
     respondents/defendants prayed for adjournment, however, the learned
     trial court rejected the petition for adjournment and closed the cross
     examination of PWs and the case was fixed on 2.2.2005 for evidence of
     the defendant ’s side.
     5)             Challenging     the   said    order   dated   2.2.2005,   the
     respondents     herein     approached     this  Court    by  filing  W.P.(C)
     No.6736/2005. This Court by an order dated 31.3.2008 set aside the
     order dated 2.2.2005 permitting the respondents to cross examine the
     PWs.
CRP No.302 of 2016                                                           Page 2 of 7

     6)             On appearance of the parties before the learned trial
     court, on an application filed by the petitioner herein on 4.7.2008, the
     said learned court was pleased to accept the evidence on affidavit
     submitted by the PWs earlier and the case was fixed on 7.8.2008 for
     cross examination of PWs. On the said date, the respondents herein
     filed an application under Order XIII Rule 10 read with Section 151 CPC
     calling for some documents to facilitate the cross examination of PWs.
     The petitioner/plaintiff side then prayed for adjournment but the
     application was rejected by the order dated 3.9.2012 passed by the
     learned trial court.
     7)             Aggrieved by the said order dated 3.9.2012, the
     defendants then filed CRP No. 7/2013 before this Court. This Court by
     an order dated 18.11.2013 declined to interfere with the order dated
     3.9.2012 passed by the learned trial court and observed that the
     ultimate decision of the trial court goes against the defendant , he may
     set up a ground in appeal that the order dated 3.9.2012 and further
     directed that probate case will be decided expeditiously within 6
     months.
     8)             Notwithstanding the refusal by this Court to interfere with
     the order dated 3.9.2012, the defendants filed an application under
     Order XI Rule 14 read with Section 151 CPC on 6.1.2014 for discovery
     of documents mentioned in the Schedule of the said application but the
     learned trial court by the order dated 10.1.2014 rejected the said
     application.
     9)             The order dated 10.1.2014 was challenged before this
     Court by filing CRP (I/O) No.25/2015, however, this Court vide order
     dated 2.4.2014 dismissed the said revision. The said dismissal order
     was assailed before the Hon’ble Apex Court , which was also dismissed.
CRP No.302 of 2016                                                         Page 3 of 7

     10)           Thereafter, the defendants filed a review petition before
     the learned trial court along with an application for condonation of
     delay and the learned trial court had rejected both the said applications
     vide order dated 15.7.2015. These orders were once again challenged
     before this Court in CRP No.297/2015 and this Court vide order dated
     25.6.2016 dismissed the said petition by imposing a cost of Rs.1000/-.
     11)           The defendants, thereafter     filed an application under
     Section 24 of CPC for transfer of the suit from the court of learned
     Additional District Judge (FTC) to any other court but the said
     application for transfer was not entertained by the learned District
     Judge, Cachar, Silchar.    Only thereafter, the order dated 25.1.2016
     passed by this Court in CRP No.297/2015, the defendants cross
     examined the PWs.
     12)           On 31.3.2016, the defendants /respondents filed an
     application before the learned trial court to expunge the evidence on
     affidavit of PW.3, Bimal Namasudra, as he had died.
     13)           It appears that the case was fixed on 31.3.2016 for cross
     examination of PWs and on the said date, the defendants by filing a
     petition No.212/2004 informed the court below about the information
     of death of PW.3 along with photocopy of death certificate was laying
     on record but no order was passed and it was submitted in the petition
     that the evidence of PW.3, Bimal Namasudra, is required to be
     expunged and separated. The plaintiff, on 8.4.2016 filed the written
     objection to the said petition.     However, the case was fixed on
     16.5.2016 for cross examination of DW.1.
     14)           On the said date, 2 PWs were present one of the PW was
     cross examined and discharged and the other PW was allowed to go
     without cross examination on the submission made by the learned
CRP No.302 of 2016                                                        Page 4 of 7

     counsel for the parties.    Hence, the case was fixed on 8.4.2016 for
     cross examination of PW.4 and the plaintiff objected the same by filing
     an objection petition No.212/2004.
     15)             The defendant side submitted evidence on affidavit of
     DW.1 on 3.5.2016 and the case was fixed on 16.5.2016 for cross
     examination of DW.1 and for hearing on Petition No.212/2004.
     16)             On   16.5.2016,  both   the  parties   have   prayed   for
     adjournment, which was allowed and the case was fixed on 23.5.2016
     and on the said date, an objection was filed being Petition No.92/2005
     and the case was fixed on 30.5.2016 for objection hearing. After that
     the case was adjourned on 30.5.2016 and 10.6.2016 and the matter
     was heard on 24.6.2016. By the order dated 24.6.2016, the evidence of
     PW.3, Bimal Namasudra was expunged and the learned trial court did
     not find any ground to allow the amendment of the plaint.             The
     aforesaid order is in challenge in the present revision.
     17)             The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that under
     the provisions of Section 33 of the Evidence Act, as the PW.3, Bimal
     Namasudra had died, his evidence ought to have been retained in the
     record owing to the relevancy of the statement made by the deceased
     witness.      It is submitted that the defendant’s side got ample
     opportunity to cross examine PW.3, but owing to their dilatory tactics
     adopted by the defendants, PW.3, who had submitted evidence on
     affidavit on 15.9.2004, could not be examined till his death on
     24.11.2005. It is submitted that unless the said evidence is kept on
     record, the petitioner would not be entitled to refer to the relevancy of
     the said evidence and retaining the said evidence on record would not
     create the prove of the contest made therein which has to be
     independently proved by the plaintiff’s side, in the manner prescribed
CRP No.302 of 2016                                                        Page 5 of 7

     under the law. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted
     that the Petition No.92/2005 which was field on 16.5.2016 was merely
     an adjournment petition, therefore, the learned trial court has
     erroneously treated the same as an application for amendment and the
     prayer for adjournment was refused by the impugned order. On this
     ground, the impugned order has been challenged by the petitioner.
     18)             Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents has
     submitted that by the order passed by this Court on 31.3.2008 in WP©
     No.6736/2005, a direction was issued to the plaintiff to produce
     witnesses and that time the petitioner did not informed this Court about
     the death of PW.3 on 24.11.2005. It is submitted that after the order
     passed by this Court, trial has been started on 23.3.2008 where it is
     found that issues were not framed and ultimately issues were framed
     on 31.3.2008 and the case was fixed for evidence of the plaintiff’s side
     on 4.7.2008 and on the said date, the petitioner/plaintiff side filed the
     Petition No.6/2002. The plaintiff had submitted before the trial court
     that the evidence in chief of PWs were already submitted on record and
     the PW.3, Bimal Namasudra had died and, as such, the evidence in
     chief of 3 PWs are on record and it was prayed that the learned court
     may take up the above evidence in chief of PW.3 as the evidence of the
     plaintiff. It is submitted that for practical purpose, it is by virtue
     of CRP No.          /2008, that the evidence of PWs has come on
     record by which it was informed that PW.3 has already
     expired. It is submitted by relying on the case of V.M. Mathews vs. S.
     Sharma and others reported in AIR 1996 SC 109 that as per pargraph-
     10 thereof unless the witness was cross examined, the effect of second
     proviso of Section 33 was not applicable and therefore, the impugned
     order was rightly passed insofar as it relates to the expunge of
     evidence. The learned counsel of the respondents further submitted
CRP No.302 of 2016                                                        Page 6 of 7

     relying on the case of Sashi Jana and others vs. Khadal Twar          and
     others, (2004) 4 SCC 236, wherein the Apex Court has laid down 3
     conditions in which the evidence of witnesses on a judicial proceeding
     can be safe under Section 33 of the Evidence Act, which are –i) that
     the earlier proceeding was between the same parties; ii) that the
     adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to
     cross examine; and iii) that the question in issue in both the proceeding
     were substantially the same. The learned counsel for the respondents
     supporting the impugned order submits that the said Petition
     No.92/2005 was not for amendment and he made an attempt to justify
     the refusal of amendment on the basis of the pleadings. However, this
     Court is not inclined to go into the pleadings at this stage because if
     the Petition No.92/2005 was not for amendment, this Court is not
     required to answer the justification part of the plaintiff/petitioner for
     praying amending of the pleadings in the suit.
