                                      BEFORE
               HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE HITESH KUMAR SARMA
         Advocates for the Petitioner      : Md. Giash Uddin, Mr. A Uddin &
                                              Ms. A Burahohain.

         Date of hearing & Judgment        : 25.07.2017
                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
               This is an application, under Section 482 Cr.PC, filed by the
        petitioner, for quashing the FIR and the proceeding initiated in connection
        with Bokakhat PS Case No. 156/2016 under Section 363(A) of the IPC.
        2)     I have perused the petition as well as copy of the FIR furnished
        with the petition.
                                                                          Page 1 of 4

        3)     It appears from the contents of the FIR that Smt. Sangita Thakur
        and Smt. Bina Thakur, lodged the FIR with the Bokakhat Police Station
        alleging that after the death of their husband Lt. Anuj Thakur, their two
        minor children were taken by the petitioner in his custody with the
        assurance that he will put them in school for their education. But, for
        about 6 (six) months thereafter, there was no communication between
        the petitioner and the informants, i.e. the respondent Nos. 2 & 3 in the
        instant petition for which they suspected that both the children might
        have been sold out to some persons by the present petitioner. Even the
        informants/respondent Nos. 2 & 3 were not allowed to communicate
        with their children by the petitioner raising the doubt in their minds.
        4)     On receipt of the FIR, Bokakhat Police Station registered a case,
        being No. 156/2016, under Section 363(A) of the IPC.
        5)     The state respondent No. 1 is represented by learned Additional PP
        Mr. B Sarma. The petitioner is represented by learned counsel, Md. Giash
        Uddin. The respondent Nos. 2 & 3, inspite of service of notice upon
        them, as appears from the office note dated 23.2.2017, have not entered
        appearance and contested this proceeding.
        6)     It appears from the FIR itself that both the children were put in the
        custody of the present petitioner by their mothers on their own, on being
        assured that the petitioner will take care of their education. The FIR has
        been lodged while the respondent Nos. 2 & 3/informants failed to contact
        their children during their stay with the petitioner, and therefore, they
                                                                            Page 2 of 4
Crl.Pet.743/2016

        suspected that their children might have been sold out to some other
        persons by the present petitioner.
        7)      The learned counsel for the petitioner has produced before this
        court, certified copies of three (3) order dated 28.6.2016, and order dated
        30.6.2016, passed in Bokakhat Police Station Case No. 156/2006 (PRC
        No. 180/2016).       It appears from the order dated 28.6.2016 that the
        Investigating Police Officer forwarded both the children of the
        informants/respondent Nos. 2 & 3 to the court of learned Sub-Divisional
        Judicial Magistrate (M), Bokakhat, for recording their statements under
        Section 164 Cr.PC.       Both the children were aged about 6 to 7 years
        respectively.    Their names are Miss. Kiron Thakur and Master Suraj
        Thakur. The statements of the said two minor children were recorded by
        the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Bokakhat, on 30.6.2016.       On
        perusal of the statements so recorded by the learned Judicial Magistrate,
        1st Class, it appears that the present petitioner had admitted both of them
        in school for their education. There does not appear to have any
        allegations of selling them to other persons by the present petitioner as
        well as engaging them in begging and in any other like job. Therefore,
        prima-facie, the allegations made in the FIR, appears to be inconsistent
        with the statements of the aforesaid two children recorded under Section
        164 of the Cr.PC.
        8)      That apart, it appears from the order dated 30.6.2016 passed in
        the aforesaid case by the in-charge Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (M),
                                                                           Page 3 of 4
Crl.Pet.743/2016

        Bokakhat that they were given in the custody of their respective mother
        on their prayer. The third order dated 28.6.2016 makes it appear that the
        present petitioner also sought custody of the aforesaid two children but
        record does not reveal that the said children were put in his custody. As
        indicated above, the record reveals that, vide order dated 30.6.2016,
        both the children were put in the custody of their respective mother.
        9)      The position being as above, the allegations made in the FIR,
        appears to be not based on facts.
        10)     In view of the above, the FIR, on the basis of which Bokakhat
        Police Station registered the case, being No. 156/2016 (PRC No.
        180/2016), under Section 363(A) of the IPC is quashed.
        11)     The certified copy of the orders produced before this court by the
        learned counsel for the petitioner, Md. Giash Uddin, be kept in the record
        for reference in future in case of any necessity.
        12)     The petition stands disposed of accordingly.
                                                                       JUDGE
