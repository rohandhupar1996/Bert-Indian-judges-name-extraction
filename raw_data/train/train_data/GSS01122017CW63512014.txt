1.       This is a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
         by the petitioner. The petitioner seeks a writ, order or direction to
         declare the acquisition proceedings with respect to the land of the
         petitioner comprised in Khasra no.2920/157 having 1/3rd share
         measuring 8 biswa; Khasra no.1294 having 1/3rd share measuring 1
         bigha 5 biswa; Khasra no.156 having 131/1245th share measuring 1
         bigha 9 biswa; Khasra no.158 having 1/3rd share measuring 2 bigha 5
         biswa; and Khasra no.193 having 1/3rd share measuring 17 biswa,
         situated in the revenue estate of village Mehrauli, New Delhi
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                    Page 1 of 8

         (hereinafter referred to as the „subject land‟) is deemed to have lapsed
         in view of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and
         Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement
         Act, 2013(New Act).
2.       Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the compensation has
         not been paid. Counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner
         would seek compensation as per New Act as it is the stand of the DDA
         that the possession has been taken and the land is handed over to the
         Horticulture Department for the SFS Scheme.
3.       Necessary facts which are required to be noticed for disposal of the
         present writ petition are that a Section 4 notification of the Land
         Acquisition Act, 1894(hereinafter referred to as the „Act‟) was issued
         on 23.01.1965, a Section 6 notification of the Act was issued on
         07.12.1966 and an Award bearing no.80-E/70-71(supp.) was passed
         on 09.01.1981. The petitioner claims that the petitioner‟s predecessor
         in interest, i.e., his father Hari Singh S/o Ramji Lal was the recorded
         owner/bhoomidar of the subject land.
4.       The counsel for the DDA while relying on the counter affidavit
         submits that the possession of the subject land was taken and handed
         over to the Horticulture Department. Counsel for the LAC relies on
         para 5 of the counter affidavit, wherein it has been stated that the
         compensation with respect to the shares of Hari Singh S/o Ramji Lal
         are unpaid and deposited in the RD.
5.       We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. Para (k) of the
         counter affidavit filed by the DDA reads as under:
              “k.       I say that the possession has been taken over in
              accordance with the law and the acquisition proceedings are
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                  Page 2 of 8

              complete qua such land as set out and as such the land vests in
              the Government free from encumbrance, which includes any
              right of the recorded owners of the land, or anyone who is an
              alleged possession or encroacher thereafter. It is submitted
              that no other person except the Government has any right, title
              or interest in the land.
              It is submitted that the land in question i.e. Khasra
              Nos.2920/157(0-8), 156(1-9), 158(2-05), 193(0-17), 1294(1-
              05) situated in village Mehrauli was acquired vide award
              no.80E/70-71/Supp. The physical possession of the above
              land was handed over to the DDA by the Land Acquisition
              Collector, L&B Department on 23.09.1981. The land bearing
              Khasra no.2920/157, 156, 158, 193 further transferred to the
              Horticulture Department on 23.09.1981, and SFS Scheme on
              24.07.1984. The notification under section 22(i) no.F9/(20)78/
              L&B/ Vol-II was issued on 19.11.1981.”
6.       It would also be useful to reproduce para 5 of the counter affidavit
         filed by the LAC, which reads as under:
              “That the correct facts are that the land in question i.e. khasra
              no.2920/157, 1294, 156, 158 and 193 Vill-Mehrauli in which
              there are shares of the petitioner was notified under section 4
              of LA Act on 23 January 1965 followed by declaration under
              section 6 on 07.12.1966 was published for planned
              development of Delhi. In pursuance of the said notification,
              notices under section 9 and 10 as provided under the Act were
              issued to the interested person inviting the claims and claims
              were also filed by the interested person. The Land Acquisition
              Collector passed Award No.80E/70-71(Supp.) dated
              09.01.1981 u/s 11 of the Act. The possession of the land was
              taken on 23.09.1981. The compensation with respect to
              74/249 shares of Khasra No.156(1-09) has been paid and
              compensation with respect to 175/249 shares of Khasra no.156
              are unpaid. One third share of khasra no.2920/157(0-08),
              158(2-05), 193(0-17) have been paid and two third shares of
              Hari Singh S/o Ramji Lal who was the recorded owner are
              unpaid.”
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                    Page 3 of 8

7.       Reading of the counter affidavits filed by the DDA and LAC make it
         clear that the possession of the land has been taken over and put to
         use. Further, reading of the counter affidavit of the LAC would show
         that 175/249 shares of Hari Singh S/o Ramji Jal in respect of Khasra
         no.156 and two third shares of Hari Singh S/o Ramji Jal in respect of
         Khasra no.2920/157(0-08), 158(2-05), 193(0-17) remained unpaid.
8.       The case of the petitioner is fully covered by the decision rendered by
         the Supreme Court of India in the case of Pune Municipal
         Corporation & Anr. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki & ors.,
         reported at (2014) 3 SCC 183. Paras 14 to 20 read as under:
              “14. Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act enjoins upon the
              Collector, on making an award under Section 11, to tender
              payment of compensation to persons interested entitled
              thereto according to award. It further mandates the Collector
              to make payment of compensation to them unless prevented
              by one of the contingencies contemplated in sub-section (2).
              The contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2) are: (i) the
              persons interested entitled to compensation do not consent
              to receive it (ii) there is no person competent to alienate the
              land and (iii) there is dispute as to the title to receive
              compensation or as to the apportionment of it. If due to any
              of the contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2), the
              Collector is prevented from making payment of
              compensation to the persons interested who are entitled to
              compensation, then the Collector is required to deposit the
              compensation in the court to which reference under Section
              18 may be made.
              15. Simply put, Section 31 of the 1894 Act makes provision
              for payment of compensation or deposit of the same in the
              court. This provision requires that the Collector should
              tender payment of compensation as awarded by him to the
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                    Page 4 of 8

              persons interested who are entitled to compensation. If due
              to happening of any contingency as contemplated
              in Section 31(2), the compensation has not been paid, the
              Collector should deposit the amount of compensation in the
              court to which reference can be made under Section 18.
              16. The mandatory nature of the provision in Section
              31(2) with regard to deposit of the compensation in the
              court is further fortified by the provisions contained
              in Sections 32, 33 and 34. As a matter of fact, Section
              33 gives power to the court, on an application by a person
              interested or claiming an interest in such money, to pass an
              order to invest the amount so deposited in such government
              or other approved securities and may direct the interest or
              other proceeds of any such investment to be accumulated
              and paid in such manner as it may consider proper so that
              the parties interested therein may have the benefit therefrom
              as they might have had from the land in respect whereof
              such money shall have been deposited or as near thereto as
              may be.
              17. While enacting Section 24(2), Parliament definitely had
              in its view Section 31 of the 1894 Act. From that one thing
              is clear that it did not intend to equate the word “paid” to
              “offered” or “tendered”. But at the same time, we do not
              think that by use of the word “paid”, Parliament intended
              receipt of compensation by the landowners/persons
              interested. In our view, it is not appropriate to give a literal
              construction to the expression “paid” used in this sub-
              section (sub-section (2) of Section 24). If a literal
              construction were to be given, then it would amount to
              ignoring procedure, mode and manner of deposit provided
              in Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act in the event of happening
              of any of the contingencies contemplated therein which may
              prevent the Collector from making actual payment of
              compensation. We are of the view, therefore, that for the
              purposes of Section 24(2), the compensation shall be
              regarded as “paid” if the compensation has been offered to
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                     Page 5 of 8

              the person interested and such compensation has been
              deposited in the court where reference under Section 18 can
              be made on happening of any of the contingencies
              contemplated under Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act. In other
              words, the compensation may be said to have been “paid”
              within the meaning of Section 24(2) when the Collector (or
              for that matter Land Acquisition Officer) has discharged his
              obligation and deposited the amount of compensation in
              court and made that amount available to the interested
              person to be dealt with as provided in Sections 32 and 33.
              18. 1894 Act being an expropriatory legis lation has to be
              strictly followed. The procedure, mode and manner for
              payment of compensation are prescribed in Part V (Sections
              31-34) of the 1894 Act. The Collector, with regard to the
              payment of compensation, can only act in the manner so
              provided. It is settled proposition of law (classic statement
              of Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad[1]) that where a power is
              given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must
              be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of
              performance are necessarily forbidden.
              19. Now, this is admitted position that award was made on
              31.01.2008. Notices were issued to the landowners to
              receive the compensation and since they did not receive the
              compensation, the amount (Rs.27 crores) was deposited in
              the government treasury. Can it be said that deposit of the
              amount of compensation in the government treasury is
              equivalent to the amount of compensation paid to the
              landowners/persons interested? We do not think so. In a
              comparatively recent decision, this Court in Agnelo
              Santimano Fernandes[2], relying upon the earlier decision in
              Prem Nath Kapur[3], has held that the deposit of the amount
              of the compensation in the state‟s revenue account is of no
              avail and the liability of the state to pay interest subsists till
              the amount has not been deposited in court.
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                      Page 6 of 8

              20. From the above, it is clear that the award pertaining to
              the subject land has been made by the Special Land
              Acquisition Officer more than five years prior to the
              commencement of the 2013 Act. It is also admitted position
              that compensation so awarded has neither been paid to the
              landowners/persons interested nor deposited in the court.
              The deposit of compensation amount in the government
              treasury is of no avail and cannot be held to be equivalent to
              compensation paid to the landowners/persons interested. We
              have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the subject land
              acquisition proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed
              under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.”
9.       Having regard to the facts noted hereinabove and the stand taken by
         the LAC and the DDA in their counter affidavits, we are of the
         considered view that the necessary ingredients for the application of
         Section 24(2) of the New Act as has been interpreted by the Supreme
         Court of India and this Court in the following cases stand satisfied:
              (1) Pune Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. Harakchand
                     Misirimal Solanki & ors., reported at (2014) 3 SCC 183;
              (2) Union of India and Ors v. Shiv Raj and Ors., reported at
                     (2014) 6 SCC 564;
              (3) Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association v. State of
                     Tamil Nadu and Ors, Civil Appeal no.8700/2013 decided on
                     10.09.2014;
              (4) Surender Singh v. Union of India & Others,
                     W.P.(C).2294/2014 decided on 12.09.2014 by this Court; and
              (5) Girish Chhabra v. Lt. Governor of Delhi and Ors;
                     W.P.(C).2759/2014 decided on 12.09.2014 by this Court.
10.      Accordingly, in our view, acquisition proceedings qua the land of the
         petitioner stand lapsed. However, as prayed, the petitioner would be
W.P. (C) No.6351/2014                                                     Page 7 of 8

         entitled to compensation under the New Act, which would be paid
         within a period of one year from today.
11.      The writ petition stands disposed of.
