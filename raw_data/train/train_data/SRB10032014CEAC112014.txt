      Mr. Satish Kumar, Sr. Standing Counsel for the respondents in
      all cases.
      CORAM:
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S. RAVINDRA BHAT
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.V. EASWAR
      MR. JUSTICE S.RAVINDRA BHAT (OPEN COURT)
      1.     These appeals impugn a common order of the Customs
      Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) made on
      8.8.213 in appeals filed on behalf of the manufacturers
      (hereafter collectively be known as the appellants - Paragon
      Group) along with their partners and Directors. The substantial
      question of law sought to be urged is as to the method adopted
      by the Revenue - respondent in valuing the seized goods;
      especially as to the weight of the copper cables recovered from
      the wooden drums.
      2.     Briefly, the facts are that the excise authorities on
      21.02.2002 carried on search and seizure operations in the
      premises of the appellants.        This was on the basis that
      manufacturers of wires and cables falling under chapter H.85.44
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                       Page 3

      of the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 were
      resorting to evasion of duty on different units owned by them or
      their job workers by claiming Small Scale Industries (SSI)
      exemption in respect of such units even though they were
      ineligible.   It was alleged that after the search and seizure
      operations the Paragon Group has suppressed more than 50% of
      the actual quantity and value of clearances and made false
      declarations describing the size of wires and cables in the
      invoices and further understated the weight of the goods.
      3.     A show cause notice was issued on 13.08.2002 by the
      Commissioner of Central Excise. After the reply was furnished,
      an oral hearing was granted and after considering the material
      on record, the order in original was made on 29.10.2004 by the
      Commissioner confirming the demand and recovering duties,
      penalty upon the ten appellants including their Directors and
      partners. Individual penalty orders were also levied in respect
      of such partners and Directors. Aggrieved, the appellants
      approached the CESTAT which by the impugned order
      dismissed the same.
      4.     It is contended on behalf of the appellants that both the
      order in original as well as CESTAT’s order suffer from an
      important omission with respect to the actual quantity. Learned
      counsel contended that the method of arriving at the weight
      (core x sq. mtrs.) was fallacious and submitted that this aspect
      was highlighted as early as the time when the hearing before the
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                   Page 4

      Commissioner took place during the show cause notice
      proceedings. Counsel urged that this aspect was not addressed
      much less appreciated in its correct perspective. This has led to
      over estimation of the seized goods.
      5.     Learned counsel highlighted that the simpler method of
      subtracting the weight of the goods instead of adopting a
      different method in arriving the weight of each length of cable
      could have been adopted to reach a more just solution. It was
      submitted that this aspect was highlighted before the Tribunal in
      the hearing. Counsel relied upon the following submissions
      made in a written note said to have been handed over after
      making oral submissions to the Tribunal: -
             “8.2.3        Submissions:
             (i) Allegations     are  based    on   assumptions    and
             presumptions.
             (ii) The demands has been worked out on the basis of a
             formula (Wt. Km.). There is no other evidence.
             (iii) The difference in weight is because of variation in
             weight of wooden drums as stated by S/Shri D.L. Nagpal,
             Sunil Nagpal, Sudhir Nagpal and Vikas Nagpal in their
             statements dt.25.7.2002.
             (iv) No weighment of seized goods got done as to certain
             exact tare and net weight. Notion weight has been
             adopted.
             (v) Weight is mentioned by transporters in LRs/GRs and
             is not declared by manufacturers who never bothered
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                   Page 5

             about the weight in LR/GR as freight was to be paid by
             the consignees.
             (vi) There is no confession in statements of
             Partners/Director regarding clandestine removal of
             excess quantity in the past except the statement dt.
             29.4.2002 of Sudhir Nagpal of Paragon Power Cables
             Ltd., which he changed in his subsequent statement dt.
             25.7.2002. Moreover, as stead by partners, directors and
             buyers all payments have been received by cheque/ bank
             draft and there is no evidence of cash payment for
             alleged excess quantity.
             (vii) The buyer at Chennai has denied having purchased
             alleged excess quantity (statement dt. 3.5.2002) in past.
             (viii) Value is to be taken as cum duty for calculating
             demand
             (ix) Interest under Section IIAB is not leviable as
             Section is not attracted in case of demand for period
             prior to 11.5.2001.”
      6.     The Revenue resists the submissions and contends that
      full opportunity was given and that the finding as to the
      question of true weight or the method adopted is a factual one
      which do not warrant interference by this Court, which
      exercises jurisdiction exclusively when there is a substantial
      question of law. It was also submitted that the manufacturers in
      this case did not appear to have in fact urged this aspect before
      the Tribunal during the hearing and that the note submitted on
      this score does not even bear the date.
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                    Page 6

      7.     This Court has considered the submissions and material
      on record.
      8.     In this regard the Court notes that during the course of the
      order in original, the Commissioner observed as follows: -
             “14. Further subsequent to the final hearing which held
             on 22.09.2004 M/s Paragon Power Cable Ltd, vide his
             letter dated 27.09.2004 has raised issue of jurisdiction
             for deciding the case and have also raised the similar
             points as detailed above and have sought the cross
             examination of tempo owner and transporter.
             I have gone through the submissions made by the
             noticees, Counsel for the noticees, Mahazars dated
             29.05.2002, 31.05.2002, 09.04.2002 and 03.07.2002 and
             also the statements of directors/ partners of
             company/firms of the noticees and other evidences
             available on records. On perusal of various Mahazars of
             seizure of goods prepared at Chennai by the Officers of
             DGCEI, Chennai, it is clear that the firms namely M/s
             Paragon Cable Company, M/s Paragon Enterprises
             (India). M/s Paracon Cable Company, M/s Paragon
             Power Cable Ltd. had been sending the goods to their
             buyers at Chennai by misdeclaring the description, size,
             quantity and value of the goods without discharging
             proper Central Excise duty. Shri Somnath Nagpal,
             partner of M/s Paragon Enterprises (India), and also of
             M/s Paragon Cable Company in his statement dated
             24.07.2002 and 26.07.2002· had unambiguously -
             admitted that there was difference in armoured and
             unarmoured cable and the armoured cable was costlier
             and he admitted the difference in description, quantity,
             variation in size etc. of wires and cables sent under the
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                     Page 7

             invoices of his firm to M/s Metal's and Metal (Elect) Pvt.
             Ltd. and M/s Metal's and Metal, Chennai and he agreed
             with the proceedings under Mahazar dated 09.04.2002,
             31.05.2002 and 29.05.2002 and 03.07.2002 and agreed
             with all the discrepancies noticed and recorded in these
             Mahazars and accepted his mistakes for sending wires
             and cables of copper in the name of aluminium,
             armoured cable in the name of unarmoured cable and of
             different size under the invoices of his firms.
             15. Shri Vikas Nagpal, Partner of M/s Paracon Cable
             Company in his statement dated 25072002 also agreed
             with the proceeding of the Mahazars dated
             09.04.2002,31.05.2002 and 29.05.2002 and 03.07.2002
             and agreed with all the discrepancies noticed and
             recorded in these Mahazars and accepted his mistakes
             for sending wires and cables of copper in the name of
             aluminium, armoured cable in the name of unarmoured
             cable and of different size under the invoices of his firms.
             16. Shri Sudhir Nagpal, Director of M/s Paragon
             Power Cable Ltd. in his statement dated 25.07.2002 also
             agreed with the proceeding of the Mahazars dated
             09.04.2002, 31.5.2002 and 29.05.2002 and 03.07.2002
             and agreed with all the discrepancies noticed and
             recorded in these Mahazars and accepted his mistakes
             for sending wires and cables of copper in the name of
             aluminium, armoured cable in the name of unarmoured
             cable and of different size under the invoices of his firms.
             In his statement dated 29.04.2002 he had specifically
             admitted that they were sending the goods i.e. wires and
             cables in excess of standard weight to the extent of the
             difference as taken out between the LR weight and the
             standard weight. Shri Sunil Nagpal, Partner of M/s
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                      Page 8

             Paragon Cable Corporation in his statement dated
             25.07.2002 also admitted when shown the worksheet
             containing the details of invoices issued by various
             companies of Paragon Group of Companies in favour of
             M/s Metal's and Metal and M/s Metal's and Metal (Elec)
             Pvt. Ltd. that there was a difference in the weight of the
             goods given in the invoices and its corresponding LRs
             and also agreed with the manner in which the difference
             and weight has been calculated. The explanation given by
             Shri Sunil Nagpal that the difference in the worksheet
             pertaining to his firm could be due to the weight of the
             wooden drum is not tenable as the weight of the wooden
             drum had been deducted while calculating the difference
             of the weight.
       Specifically as to the question of weight, the Commissioner
      recorded the following findings: -
             “vi) The Counsel had pointed out that the department
             had seized goods at godown of a buyer a Chennai but
             they had not weighed any of the drums. The scrutiny of
             the various of Mahazars prepared at Chennai clearly
             indicate that the goods seized were actually accompanied
             by invoices of different description, the invoices were
             prepared for unarmoured cable in place of armoured
             cable, aluminium cable in place of copper cables and
             also the quantity was found to be excess, the facts had
             also been admitted very categorically by the
             partners/directors of the respective Paragon Group of
             Companies . When there was a clear difference in the
             goods physically found and seized and the invoice
             accompanying these goods, these were sufficient evidence
             to prove the evasion of the Central Excise duty.
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                   Page 9

             vii) The Counsel for the noticees has pointed out that
             the difference of weight had been found out in only in
             fewer number of invoices and in many invoices the
             difference of weight is very meagre. This argument was
             not tenable as there was admittedly variations in the
             goods found on physical verification with the seized and
             the accompanying invoices. The department had raised
             demand in respect of only those cases where the
             difference in weight mentioned on LRs had been found
             more than the standard weight and the number of cases
             where the meagre difference in weight had been found
             may develop into clandestine removal of a bigger volume.
             viii) The department had raised demand in respect of
             those cases where the difference in weight mentioned on
             LRs had been found more than the convertible standard
             weight and the revenue loss was detected.”
      9.     In view of the above, ordinarily the matter ought to have
      ended there; we, however, notice that the learned counsel
      stressed that the aspect was highlighted during the course of
      hearing. Now, the grounds of appeal before the Tribunal are
      not very specific on this aspect even though a general grievance
      is made about the question of valuation. However, this specific
      point appears to have been made in the written submissions said
      to have been handed over to the Tribunal. The Tribunal did not
      make its order contemporaneously or within a month of the date
      of hearing; in this case it rendered its order and published it
      after about five months. In these circumstances, without any
      explanation as to whether the written submissions were handed
      over, particularly since they do not bear any date, it would be
      hazardous for this Court to conclude that the argument on this
CEAC 11-19/2014                                                  Page 10

      aspect was made before the Tribunal which failed to apply its
      mind. We have deemed it appropriate to discuss this aspect
      since the appellant’s counsel repeatedly submitted that this had
      a direct bearing on the question of valuation and that the
      Tribunal ought to have taken care to address the issue. The
      affidavit in support of the appeal no doubt states that the copies
      placed on the record are true copies, yet significantly there is no
      date attributed to the written submissions in any of the
      pleadings. In this background of the matter, this Court is of the
      opinion that no substantial question of law arises for
      consideration.
      10.    The appeals are accordingly dismissed, along with all the
      pending applications.
