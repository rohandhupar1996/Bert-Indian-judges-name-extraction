                             Heard Ms. N. Hawelia, the learned Counsel appearing for the
             petitioner. The Revenue is represented by the learned Counsel Mr. B. Choudhury.
             2.                The petitioner is a proprietorship firm in the business of, inter
             alia, sale of Jute, Supari etc. The firm is registered as a dealer under the Assam
             Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as “the VAT Act”) and the
             Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as “the CST Act”). The
             present case relates to the assessment year 2005 – 2006 when the dealer

                                                             2
                  affected inter-state sales of Jute under the CST Act. The turnover return of the
                  dealer was examined under Section 9(2) of the CST Act read with Section 34 of
                  the VAT Act and having found the declared price of jute at Rs.4.55 a kg. to be on
                  the lower side, the Assessing Authority assessed the jute price at Rs.5.10 a k.g.
                  and on that basis, the tax was determined. The dealer accepted the assessment
                  and paid the tax on the turnover stipulated by the Assessing Authority as
                  assessed on 30.4.2007 (Annexure-I).
                  3.      However the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes, Dhubri as the Revisional
                  Authority issued show cause notice on 2.8.2007 for suo-motu Revision of the
                  assessment order under Section 82 of the VAT Act by referring to the turnover
                  declared by the dealer at Buxirhat Check-Gate of West Bengal while dispatching
                  the goods in course of inter-state trade. But the first show cause notice of
                  2.8.2007 was cancelled and substituted by a 2nd notice, dated 28.11.2007
                  (Annexure-III). The Deputy Commissioner of Taxes in the 2nd notice referred to
                  the declared turnover at the Assam Check-gate to the tune of Rs.3,21,70,791/-
                  and accordingly asked the dealer to show-cause as to why the suo-motu Revision
                  of Assessment should not be made, in respect of the earlier assessment order
                  dated 30.4.2007. Opportunity of only 7 days’ time was granted for appearance of
                  the Assessee and they could not appear and subsequently, the impugned order
                  was passed on 29.2.2008 (Page-32) cancelling the original Assessment and
                  direction was issued for fresh assessment on higher turnover of Rs.3,21,70,791/,
                  for the Assessment Year 2005 – 2006. Then assessment order cum demand
                  notice dated 17.3.2008 for Rs.17,43,272/-, towards tax and interest was served
                  on the dealer.
                  4.1     Assailing the impugned orders, Ms. N. Hawelia, the learned Counsel
                  submits that the suo-motu Revisional power could not have been exercised in the
                  instant case as it is not disclosed as to how the assessment made by the Primary
                  Authority, was erroneous. The Counsel submits that although assessment on
                  higher turnover may be in Revenue’s interest, unless it is established on
                  acceptable basis that the assessment by the Primary Authority made with
WP(c) No.4134/2010
                                                                               Page 2 of 4

                                                           3
                  reference to market price of jute, was erroneous, the exercise of suo-motu
                  Revisional power for re-assessment, would not be justified in law.
                  4.2      Since only 7 days’ time was granted for appearance of the Assessee
                  before the Revisional Authority, the learned Counsel submits that reasonable
                  opportunity required to be provided under Section 82 of the VAT Act, was denied
                  to the dealer.
                  5.       To exercise the power of Revision under Section 82 of the VAT Act, the
                  order to be revised must not only be prejudicial to the interest of Revenue but
                  should also be erroneous and such inference must be drawn on the basis of
                  relevant materials.    Neither a wrong order will justify suo-motu Revision nor
                  mere disagreement with the order of the original Authority, can lead to fresh
                  determination of tax, on higher turnover.
                  6.       For the assessment year 2005 – 2006, the Assessee in their return
                  claimed the turnover of Rs.1,73,75,080/- by declaring the price of jute at Rs.4.55
                  per k.g. but this was not accepted by the Primary Authority by considering the
                  said price to be on the lower side. Thus the market price of jute was determined
                  by the Assessing Authority at Rs.5.10 a k.g. and on that basis, the higher taxable
                  turnover was determined at Rs.1,94,57,816/- instead of 1,73,75,080/-. The
                  assessment so made by the Assistant Commissioner of Taxes was accepted by
                  the dealer and the payable tax was deposited, by the assessee.
                  7.       However suo-motu Revisional power under Section 82 of the VAT Act was
                  invoked by referring to the jute price declared at the Assam Check-Gate in course
                  of inter-state sale and on that basis, higher turnover was determined by the
                  Revisional Authority under the impugned order of 29.2.2008. The order passed
                  by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes does not indicate how the turnover
                  finalized by the Assessing Authority was erroneous. More importantly, it is not
                  said that wrong market price of jute (Rs.5.10 a k.g.) was considered by the
                  Assessing Authority. Therefore, it is apparent that the Revisional Authority failed
                  to justify how the assessment was erroneous. In the absence of such justification
                  the exercise of Revisional power under Section 82 of the VAT Act without
WP(c) No.4134/2010
                                                                               Page 3 of 4

                                                          4
                  satisfying the mandatory requirement, cannot legally be sustained.
                  8.      When the assessment was done on a higher turnover than what was
                  declared by the dealer, the Primary Authority referred to the market price of jute.
                  Hence unless it is established that the market price was not genuine, the
                  Revisional Authority, only because he has a different view in the matter, cannot
                  trench upon the power of the Primary Authority, to order for re-assessment of
                  tax on the finalized turnover.
                  9.      There can be a situation where the Revisional authority considers an
                  assessment order to be incorrect. But when the assessment order is passed
                  lawfully in due process and payable tax is determined, just because there is
                  disagreement with the decision of the primary authority, the exercise of suo-
                  motu power of revision is not permitted by law.
                  10.     Moreover it is not a case of concealment nor the Revisional power is
                  exercised on account of some manipulation of figures by the Assessee. In fact,
                  the turnover in the return was supported by all requisite bills and invoices. Even
                  then, a higher turnover was assessed by the Primary Authority with reference to
                  the market price of the goods and this was accepted by the Assessee and
                  demanded tax on the determined turnover was paid. Nevertheless without
                  indicating how the assessed turnover was erroneous with cogent materials, the
                  suo-motu Revisional power was invoked to order for re-determination of tax on a
                  higher figure. The exercise of Revisional power under Section 82 of the VAT Act
                  in such circumstances is found to be untenable and the same stands quashed.
                  Thus re-assessment of tax on 17.3.2008 (Annexure-V) on the basis of the
                  impugned order passed by the Revisional Authority on 29.2.2008, is interfered
                  with.
                  11.     With the above declaration, the case stands allowed in the manner
                  indicated. No cost.
                                                                                     JUDGE
