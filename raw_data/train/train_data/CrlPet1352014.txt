                          Criminal Petition No. 135 of 2014
                                           BEFORE
                  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Bhaskar Dev Konwar, learned senior counsel, assisted by Mr.
    Rajeeb Kalita, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Mr. Angshuman Bora,
    learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Subhajit Banik, learned counsel for the
    respondent Nos. 1 to 5 and Mr. Bhaskar Jyoti Dutta, learned Assistant Public
    Prosecutor, Assam for the State respondent No. 6.
    2.       The respondent Nos. 1 to 5 are contractors by profession and on
    30.11.2013, they filed a criminal complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate,
    Tinsukia alleging that the Executive Engineer of the Public Health Engineering (PHE,
    in short) of Tinsukia Division along with one Sri Debajit Phukan, a contractor,
    registered under the PHE, Tinsukia misappropriated public fund amounting to Rs.
    1,30,994/- that was allotted to PHE, Tinsukia. It is alleged by those complainants
    that the said Executive Engineer, Mr. Mazid on 21.05.2013 had allotted a work in
    favour of the contractor Mr. Debajit Phukan for up-gradation of village road for
    movement of drilling rig to work site at Boraligaon No. 2 under Public Water Supply
    Scheme at a tender value of Rs. 1,30,994/-, but surprisingly, without any work, the
    said contractor Debajit Phukan submitted bill for the said work on 26.05.2013 for
    the said amount of Rs. 1,30,994/- by submitting completion of work certificate and
    that the said Executive Engineer Mr. Mazid paid the said amount in favour of the
    contractor Debajit Phukan, knowing fully well that the work was not done as per
    the tender and, thereby, both of them, said Executive Engineer Mr. Mazid as well as
    the contractor Debajit Phukan have committed the offence of misappropriation of
    public money.
    3.       The said complaint was registered as C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 before the
    Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tinsukia and the said Magistrate on
    30.11.2013 recorded the statements of all the five complainants.       Similarly, the
    statements of the Government Village Headman of Boraligaon, namely, Phulen Ch.
    Bora as well as that of the Head Assistant in the office of the Executive Engineer,

the then Chief Manager of the State Bank of India, Digboi Branch, namely, Sri
Gautam Bose on 18.12.2013 were recorded by the learned CJM, Tinsukia.
4.       Thereafter, said CJM, Tinsukia by his order dated 24.12.2013 directed the
petitioner herein to appear in his Court on 30.12.2013 for adducing evidence in the
said C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 and on his such appearance, the CJM, Tinsukia
recorded petitioner’s statement in said C.R. Case No. 224C/2013. On the said date,
i.e. 30.12.2013, the CJM, Tinsukia also recorded the statement of the accused
contractor Sri Debajit Phukan in the said C.R. Case.
5.       The CJM, Tinsukia on 18.01.2014 further recorded the statement of the
accused Executive Engineer, PHE, Tinsukia Division Altaf Mazid and by the
impugned order dated 18.01.2014, the said Trial Magistrate, Tinsukia came to a
finding that the accused Executive Engineer, PHE, Tinsukia Division Sri Altaf Mazid
in collusion with the accused contractor Debajit Phukan and the present petitioner
dishonestly misappropriated the entire amount of Rs. 1,30,994/- under the P/W/S/
Scheme of drilling rig work at Boraligaon No. 2 by preparing false bill and being
prima facie satisfied took cognizance of the offences under Sections 120(B)/409/
471 IPC against the aforesaid three persons including the petitioner herein and
considering the nature and gravity of the offences, the CJM, Tinsukia by the said
order dated 18.01.2014 took those accused persons in judicial custody, issued
intermediate custody against them and transferred the case to the Court of learned
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Tinsukia for trial.
6.       Being aggrieved with the said order dated 18.01.2014 passed by the CJM,
Tinsukia in said C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 in taking cognizance of the offences
under Sections 120(B)/409/471 IPC, against him; the petitioner has preferred this
Crl. Ptn. No. 135 of 2014                                                Page 2 of 6

Criminal Petition to set aside and quash the said charges against him in the said
C.R. Case that is pending before the learned JMFC, Tinsukia.
7.       While issuing notice to the respondents in the case, the Court by order
dated 03.03.2014 in the interim stayed the further proceeding of said C.R. Case No.
224C/2013 and the same is still in force.
8.       Mr. Konwar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the
concerned Magistrate acted arbitrarily and took cognizance of the offences without
obtaining any necessary approval from the authority concerned to proceed against
the petitioner, who is a Government employee and serving as Assistant Executive
Engineer at PHE, Digboi Sub-Division. According to the learned senior counsel, the
Magistrate could not have taken cognizance of the offences under Sections
120(B)/409/471 IPC without obtaining any such prior approval as required under
Section 197 Cr.P.C. and, as such, the entire proceeding of said complaint case
being C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 being vitiated, should set aside and quashed.
9.       Mr. Bora, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the complainants on
the other hand submits that the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tinsukia after recording
the statement of the complainants and some other relevant witnesses implicated
the petitioner in the said C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 as one of the witness Sri
Sumanta Bora in his statement before the Magistrate, clearly stated that he was
forced by the petitioner and the Executive Engineer, PHE Tinsukia Division to
prepare false bill amounting to Rs. 1,30,994/- along with the field check
measurement in the name of the contractor, Debajit Phukan against the work of
PWS Scheme at Boraligaon No.2, though nothing was done at said Boraligaon No.2
with regard to the work that was allotted to the accused contractor Debajit Phukan
by the accused Altaf Mazid. Mr. Bora also submitted that the Government Village
Headman of Boraligaon No. 2, in his statement before the Magistrate also
submitted that no contractor or any official visited the work site and the said road
had been lying in its original condition without any development work. Another
witness, the Deputy Accounts Officer-cum-Bill Auditor in the office of the Executive
Engineer, PHE, as placed by Mr. Bora, stated that the petitioner was working as an
Assistant Executive Engineer, PHE Digboi Sub-Division countersigned the bill
submitted by accused contractor Debajit Phukan against the work order for up-
Crl. Ptn. No. 135 of 2014                                                Page 3 of 6

gradation of village road at Boraligaon No.2 under PWS Scheme                which was
reiterated by another witness, the Accounts Officer of the Office of the Executive
Engineer, PHE, Tinsukia.
10.      It is not disputed by the parties that the petitioner was serving in his official
capacity as an Assistant Executive Engineer in the Digboi Sub-Division of PHE and
that he countersigned the bill of Rs. 1,30,994/- that was submitted by the accused
contractor Debajit Phukan after being approved and passed by the Junior Engineer,
PHE Digboi Sub-Division Sri Sumanta Bora and that the petitioner in his official
capacity as Assistant Executive Engineer countersigned the said bill, the amount
that was already released to the accused contractor Debajit Phukan.
11.      It is settled that the question of sanction under Section 197 of the Cr.P.C
can be raised at any time after cognizance had been taken and may have to be
determined at different stages of the proceeding of the trial [Chandan Kumar Basu
-Vs- State of Bihar, (2014) 13 SCC 70].
12.      It is also settled that it can be no part of the duly of a public servant or
acting in the discharge of his official duties to commit any of the offences covered
by sections 406, 409, 420 IPC etc. and the official status of the public servant can,
at best, only provide an opportunity for the commission of the offences and,
therefore, no sanction for prosecution of the public servant for such offences would
be required under section 197 of the Code. In the present case, cognizance of the
offences under Sections 120(B)/409/471 IPC has been taken against the petitioner
and whether such sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. would be required or not
would depend on the evidence that may come on record in the course of the trial.
13.      It is alleged that the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tinsukia while taking
cognizance of the offences under Sections 120(B)/409/471 IPC by the impugned
order dated 18.01.2014 committed illegally as because by the order dated
24.12.2013 he was only asked to appear as a witness in the said C.R. Case No.
224C/2013 and just on a mere statement of one of such witness, Junior Engineer of
the PHE Digboi Sub-Division who prepared the bill, took cognizance of the offences
against the petitioner in violation of the provisions of Section 200, 202 and 204
Cr.P.C.
Crl. Ptn. No. 135 of 2014                                                    Page 4 of 6

14.      Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Narmada Prasad Sonkar @ Ramu -Vs-
Sardar Avtar Singh Chabara & Ors., reported in (2006) 9 SCC 61, have held that if
the Magistrate had not followed the procedure and has failed to apply his mind as
required by law, the order issuing process could be quashed but the Magistrate
should be directed to reconsider the matter and pass fresh order in accordance
with law.
15.      It is seen that before process is issued in the case, as per the direction of
the CJM, Tinsukia on 24.12.2013, the petitioner herein, who is a name accused in
the complaint of the case, appeared before the said Magistrate on 30.12.2013 and
the evidence that he adduced was already recorded by the said CJM, Tinsukia in
the said C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 on 30.12.2013 itself.          It is settled that the
accused has no right to be heard before issue of process and the Code does not
contemplate the holding of two trials for the accused, one before issue of process
and the other after the issue of process, since at the time of taking cognizance of
the offence, the Court is not required to consider the defence of the accused.
16.      Moreover, at the time of taking cognizance of the offence, the Court is
required to consider the averments made in the complaint and it is not open to the
Court to analyse the evidence produced at that stage and come to the conclusion
as to whether prima facie case is made out for proceeding further in the matter. It
is not the province of the Court at that stage to embark upon and sift evidence to
come to the conclusion whether or not an offence has been made out. [(2012) 3
SCC 64]
17.      Considering the entire aspect of the matter and finding that the petitioner
has countersigned the bill submitted by the accused contractor after being
approved and passed by the Junior Engineer, PHE Digboi Sub-Division Sri Sumanta
Bora, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate after taking cognizance of the offences
under Sections 120(B)/409/471 IPC against the petitioner and before forwarding
the matter to the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Tinsukia for trial of the case,
should have obtained necessary prosecution sanction for trial of the petitioner as it
is evident that he countersigned the bill in his official capacity functioning as
Assistant Executive Engineer, PHE, Digboi Sub Division.
Crl. Ptn. No. 135 of 2014                                                    Page 5 of 6

18.      Finding such procedural irregularity while taking cognizance of the offences
under Sections 120(B)/409/471 IPC by the impugned order dated 18.01.2014
passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tinsukia in C.R. Case No. 224C/2013, the
Court is of the view that if the same is allowed to continue it would be an abuse of
the process of the Court and as such, for the ends of justice, the same is set aside
and quashed. However, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tinsukia shall
reconsider the entire matter pertaining to said complaint case being C.R. Case No.
224C/2013 and to pass a fresh order in accordance with law.
19.      With the aforesaid observation and direction this petition stands allowed.
20.      The stay order passed earlier in this proceeding on 03.03.2014 stands
merged with this order.
21.      Registry shall return the LCR of C.R. Case No. 224C/2013 to the Court of
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tinsukia forthwith along with a copy of this order.
                                                                     JUDGE
