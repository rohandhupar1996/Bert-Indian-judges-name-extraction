                               BEFORE
          HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE KALYAN RAI SURANA
Advocates for the Petitioner      : Mr. R. Borpujari,
                                    Ms. M. Das,

Date judgment                     : 23.06.2017
                      JUDGMENT AND ORDER
           Heard Mr. R. Borpujari, the learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. J. Deka, the learned counsel for the respondent
No.2/ Defendant No.1. None appears for Respondent No.1/ Plaintiff
when the matter was called.
2)         In challenge in this application under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India is the order dated 14.09.2016 passed by the
learned Munsiff No.1, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati, in T.S. No.
540/2009.
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                      Page 1 of 8

3)          The Petitioner is arrayed as Proforma Defendant No.2 in
the said suit, which was filed by the respondent No.1/ Plaintiff,
seeking relief against the respondent No.2/ Defendant No.1. The
plaintiff is the wife of the Proforma Defendant. For the sake of
convenience, the parties are referred as arrayed in the suit.
4)          Owing to the issue involved herein, this judgment need not
be burdened with the pleadings of the parties. It would suffice to
state that while no relief was claimed against the proforma
defendant No.2 in the suit, the proforma defendant No.2 submitted
his written statement and admitted the entire claim of the plaintiff
(i.e. his wife), for which the plaintiff did not amend the plaint and did
not seek any relief against the proforma defendant No.2.
5)          In course of time, the plaintiff produced her witness, who
were cross-examined by the defendant No.1 but there was no cross-
examination of the plaintiff by the proforma defendant No.2. Then
the witness of the defendant No.1 was examined and was cross
examined by the plaintiff, but there was no cross examination by the
proforma defendant No.2. Thereafter, by order dated 16.02.2016,
the suit was posted on 21.03.2016 for argument.
6)          Thereafter,   by   filing    petition  No.  1111/10      dated
21.03.2016, the proforma defendant No.2, prayed for vacating the
order dated 16.02.2016 and accept his evidence- on- affidavit filed
on 21.03.2016 and to fix another date for his cross examination. The
defendant No.1 filed her written objection and the matter was heard
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                        Page 2 of 8

on 20.07.2016. Thereafter, by the impugned order, the said petition
filed by the proforma defendant No.2 was rejected.
7)         The learned counsel for the proforma defendant No.1/
petitioner submits that as he had filed his written statement, the
proforma defendant No.1 had an indefeasible right to tender his
evidence in the case. It is submitted that merely because the plaintiff
and the proforma defendant No.2 are related, that cannot preclude
his right as of the contesting parties in the suit to examine himself as
a witness by filing his evidence- on- affidavit. The learned counsel for
the petitioner has relied on the statements made in the petition No.
1111/16 and submitted that on 16.02.2016, the case was fixed for
passing necessary orders and, on the said date his counsel had
discussed the matter with the Bench Assistant so that the case may
be next posted for evidence of the proforma defendant No.2, but the
case record was not put up. The engaged counsel once again
enquired in the next hour and came to learn that the suit had been
fixed on 21.03.2016 for argument. Hence, on 21.03.2016, the
proforma defendant No.2 had moved the said petition No. 1111/16
before the learned court below together with his evidence- on
affidavit. It is submitted that there was an inadvertent delay, but
would not cause any prejudice to the either side as because on
21.03.2016, when the case was first fixed for argument, the
evidence- on – affidavit by the proforma defendant No.1 had already
come on record.
8)         The learned court below, by the order dated 14.09.2016,
rejected the said prayer, further directing that the evidence- on –
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                       Page 3 of 8

affidavit filed by the proforma defendant No.2 would not form a part
of the record. The said order is impugned herein.
9)          Per contra, the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 has
argued in support of the impugned order. By referring to the print-
out of the case history, as downloaded from the web-site of
http://services.ecourts.gov.in/ ecourtindia, it is submitted that on
19.11.2010 and 04.12.2010, the case was fixed for steps before
preliminary hearing, but no steps were taken by the proforma
defendant No.2, then the case was fixed for cross examination of
plaintiff’s evidence on five dates from 07.11.2014 to 27.04.2015, but
the proforma defendant No.2 did not cross examine the PWs.
Thereafter, the suit was fixed on 5 dates from 21.05.2015 to
28.09.2015. Thereafter, the case was sent for recording of cross
examination by the Advocate Commissioner appointed for the said
purpose and the case was fixed for report by the Commissioner on 6
dates from 19.11.2015 to 11.12.2015. Thereafter, the case was fixed
for passing of necessary orders and after the case was posted on
21.03.2016 for argument, then for the first time a plea was taken to
permit the proforma defendant No.2 to accept his evidence.
10)         The learned counsel for the defendant No.1 submits that
although the suit was posted for defendant’s witness on and from
21.05.2015, the proforma defendant No.2 had slept over his right
and on no occasion between the period from 21.05.2015 to
21.03.2016, did the said proforma defendant take any initiative to
examine himself. It is also submitted that on no earlier occasion, did
the said proforma defendant had made any prayer for adjournment
or shown cause for the inability to file his evidence- on- affidavit. By
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                      Page 4 of 8

referring to the provisions of Order XVIII Rule 2 of the Civil
Procedure Code, it is submitted that it was a baseless perception of
the proforma defendant No.2 that after the evidence of defendant
No.1 is over, the trial court would invite him to give his evidence. It
is submitted that as per the provisions of Order XVIII Rule 2 of the
Code, all the defendants were required to file their respective
evidence- on- affidavits, irrespective of their status as defendants in
the suit. The learned counsel for the defendant No.1 by relying on
the provisions of Order XVII Rule 1 of the Code also submits that as
per the said provision, a party may avail a maximum of 3 (three)
adjournments after the commencement of hearing. it is submitted
that the first preemptory hearing for framing issues occurred
sometime in the year 2010, so the proforma defendant No.2 is
deemed to have availed more than the said prescribed adjournment
as he had neither filed his evidence- on- affidavit on proper time nor
he had prayed for extension of time to file such evidence, even
during an extraordinary long period between 21.05.2015 to
21.03.2016, while witness of defendant No.1 was still being
examined and/or cross examined. Therefore, it was prayed that
there was no infirmity in the impugned order.
11)         Upon hearing the learned counsel for the Petitioner/
Proforma defendant No.2 and respondent/ defendant, this court has
perused the materials on record and it was deemed fit to dispose of
this revision at the admission stage itself.
12)         It is seen that as per the scheme of the Civil Procedure
Code as well as the Civil Court Rules & Orders framed by Gauhati
High Court, the same do not recognize a defendant differently from a
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                       Page 5 of 8

proforma defendant. Although no authority on the point could be
shown before this Court, the “proforma defendant” status of parties
has come to be recognized by the prevailing practice being followed
by this Court as well as subordinate courts under the jurisdiction of
this Court, but this observation may not be treated as a decision on
the point, this is only a passing remark because as per the provisions
of Order XVIII Rule 2(1) of the Code, it is provided that on the day
fixed for hearing any party who has the right to begin would produce
his evidence in support of the issues which he is bound to prove.
Under the provisions of Order XVIII Rule 2(2) of the Code, after the
evidence of one party is over, the other party is then required to
state his case and produce his evidence (if any) and may then
address the court generally on the whole case. Thus, in the opinion
of this court, the words “other party” appearing in Order XVIII Rule
2(2) of the Code would include all defendants including the proforma
defendants in a suit.
13)        In the further opinion of this Court, if the procedure as
argued by the learned counsel for the Proforma defendant No.2 is
accepted, then it would set an incorrect precedent where after
examination in chief and cross examination of each party to a suit is
over, the trial courts would have to call upon the next party in the
queue or list to tender evidence and also to face cross examination.
Thus, in a given case where there are multiple parties, then the
evidence would be never ending.
14)        It is also not the projected case of the proforma defendant
No.2 that he had suffered from any legal disability which prevented
him from filing his evidence- on- affidavit in the appropriate stage of
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                       Page 6 of 8

the suit. The words “(if any)”, used in the provisions of Order XVIII
Rule 2(2) of the Code indicates that as per the scheme of the Code,
if no witness is produced, then also the case can be proceed to the
stage of argument. There is another mischief that may occur in a few
cases if the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is
accepted, because it would enable a unscrupulous plaintiff to array
his own person as the last proforma defendant, then wait for
evidence of all parties to be over and then come in the last and
easily fill-up the lacunae that might have remained in the suit. In this
regard, it would be pertinent to extract the statements made in
paragraph (2) of the petition No. 1111/16 dated 21.03.2016, where
the proforma defendant No.2 has stated as follows –
             “2.       That the petitioner who is the proforma
             defendant also filed his written statement in the suit on
             25.01.2010 and he has been taking steps regularly.”
             The aforesaid statement is indicative of the fact that the
proforma defendant No.2, who is the husband of the plaintiff, is
admittedly keeping a track of the suit and taking steps regularly,
which also shows that he is aware of whatever that has transpired in
the suit during cross-examination of witnesses of both sides and not
only that, his counsel has admittedly been speaking to Bench
Assistant instead of addressing his point to Court by filing an
appropriate petition, but at the stage of argument, the proforma
defendant No.2 has come to court at his sweet convenience wanting
to examine himself as witness, which, according to this court, is not
permissible.
CRP(I/O) No.76/2017                                      Page 7 of 8

15)        Notwithstanding     that  the  first hearing    of  the    suit
commenced with issue hearing in the year of 2010, as the evidence
of the defendant’s side commenced on 21.05.2015, but no witness
was examined by the proforma defendant No.2 till 21.03.2017, the
said conduct of inaction on part of the proforma respondent would
also constitute waiver.
16)        Hence, in view of the discussions above, this court is not
inclined to accept the argument advanced by the learned counsel for
the petitioner. No infirmity or jurisdictional error is found in the
impugned order, which is upheld.
17)        A party to a suit does have the right to examine himself as
witness, but it must be done at an appropriate stage, and in any
case without exhausting the limit of three adjournments as provided
in Order XVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, which commences
from the “date of first hearing” in a suit. This is the appropriate time
to remember an often quoted legal maxim – Law comes to the aid of
the vigilant and not the dormant.
18)        Accordingly, this revision is dismissed. However, the
parties are left to bear their own cost.
