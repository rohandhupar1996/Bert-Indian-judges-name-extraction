                       JUDGMENT AND ORDER( ORAL)
          Heard Mr. SN Tamuli, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner
and Mr. A Chetri, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1. Mr. RK
Talukdar, learned counsel appears for respondent No.4 whereas Ms. DD
Barman, learned State counsel appears for the respondent Nos. 2, 3 and
5.
2.       The case of the writ petitioner is that he initially joined his service
as Extra Writer in the office of the Sub-Registrar, Jorhat on 25.6.1964 and
from which post, he retired on 30.4.1998 on attaining the age of
superannuation.
3.         The family pension paper of the petitioner was forwarded to the
respondent No.4 for release of family pension vide letter dated 16.6.1999.
However, the respondent No.4 vide communication dated 19.5.2000
(Annexure-6) informed the District Registrar, Jorhat that as per the
Service Book of the petitioner’s husband, he had rendered only 9 years
and 9 months of temporary service and he was not confirmed. Therefore,
he was only entitled to terminal gratuity as per the relevant rules. The
provisional family pension and DCRG sanctioned to the late husband of the
petitioner was therefore found to be unauthorized and thus the Service
       WP (C) No. 1849 of 2015                                Page 2 of 4

Book and family pension papers were returned for re-submissions in terms
of the observations given.
4.           The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the service
of the petitioner’s husband was regularized vide notification dated
19.5.1989 w.e.f. 1.1.1988. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that from the list of Extra-Writer submitted by the Deputy Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Registration Department dated 23.11.1989
(Annexure-2), the date of regularization of the petitioner as well as other
similarly situated persons      can be seen. The learned counsel further
submits that the name of the late petitioner’s husband also find place at
serial No.22 of the list issued vide office order dated 20.8.1990 (Annexure-
3). Although the office of the District Registrar at Jorhat had made several
communications in favour of the petitioner’s late husband for condonation
of the deficiency in service, the same has received no consideration. The
petitioner herself on 6.9.2009 submitted a representation to the
respondent No.1 which again was not considered by the said authority.
Having no other option, the petitioner is before this Court.
5.         The learned counsel for the writ petitioner submits that the case
of   the   petitioner   is   squarely   covered    by  the   various    judicial
pronouncements wherein the case of an employee who had deficiency in
service rendered for being entitled to family pension has been duly
considered. He further submits that Rule-31 of the Assam Services
(Pension Rules) 1969 clearly provides that the deficiency in qualifying
service can clearly be considered and addressed by the appropriate
authority. Furthermore, Rule -67 of the same Rules also provides that the
condonation of deficiency in service can be considered for a period not
        WP (C) No. 1849 of 2015                             Page 3 of 4

exceeding 12 months. It is also noticed that Office Memorandum issued
under Memo No. PPG (P) -196/92/61 dated 6.9.2003 issued by the
respondent No.1 also provides that the Government servant rendering 20
years of continuous service without being confirmed would be eligible for
pensionary benefit.
6.        Considering the case of the writ petiotner as well as the relevant
rules and OM that has been referred to, the writ petition is disposed of
with a direction to the respondent No.2 to examine the claim of the writ
petition in the light of the pension rules referred to above as well as the
office memorandum and the observations made herein above and dispose
of the claim of the petitioner within a period of 2(two) months from the
date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. If the petitioner is found to
be eligible to receive the family pension and other benefits, respondent
No.2 shall thereafter forthwith furnish pension papers to the respondent
No.4 for taking necessary action. The office of the Accountant General
shall thereafter process the pension papers for payment within a period of
3(three) weeks thereafter.
7.           With the above observations and directions, the writ petition
stands disposed of. No cost.
                                                                  JUDGE
