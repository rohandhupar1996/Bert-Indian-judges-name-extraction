                              Crl. Pet. No. 415 of 2016
                                            BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
03.08.2017
             Heard Mr. Dulal Chandra Kath Hazarika, learned counsel for the accused
    petitioners. Also heard Mr. Pranjit Singha Lahkar, learned Additional Public
    Prosecutor, Assam, for the respondent No.1 and Mr. Muij Uddin Mahmud, learned
    counsel, for the respondent No. 2, the complainant/informant.
    2.       The respondent No. 2 on 7.6.2012 as a complainant filed a criminal
    complaint being CR Case No. 2796C/2012, before the learned Chief Judicial
    Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati against the present petitioners for the
    offences under Sections 379/420/406/506/34 IPC with regard to an incident that
    occurred on 03.12.2011 at 3:30 PM at Pamohi and prayed in the said complaint
    amongst others to admit the said compliant, to direct the Officer-in-Charge (O/C) of
    Gorchuk Police station to inquire into the matter and to arrest the accused persons.
    3.       On receipt of the same, the learned CJM, Kamrup (M), Guwahati by his
    order dated 07.06.2012 itself forwarded the said complaint of the respondent No.2
    to the O/C of Gorchuk Police Station directing him to register it as a case,
    investigate into the matter and to submit report at an early date. Accordingly,
    Gorchuk PS Case No.179/2012 corresponding to GR Case No. 6307/2012 under
    Sections 379/420/406/506/34 IPC was registered against the petitioners. After
    completion of investigation of the case, the O/C of Gorchuk Police Station on
    31.05.2013 Vide No. 71/2013 submitted the charge-sheet in said Gorchuk PS Case
    No. 179/2012 (corresponding to GR Case No.6307/2012) stating that there are
    sufficient materials against the petitioners under Sections 379/420/406/506/34 IPC.
    The learned CJM upon receipt of the said charge-sheet in GR Case No. 6307/2012
    transferred the same to the court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Kamrup
    (Metro), Guwahati for its disposal. The learned JMFC, Kamrup (M), Guwahati took
    cognizance of the offences under Sections 379/420/406/506/34 IPC against the

    Crl. Ptn. No. 415 of 2016                                                Page 1 of 4

4.       Being aggrieved with the same, the petitioners have preferred this criminal
petition for quashing the proceeding of said GR Case No. 6307/2012 along with the
Charge-Sheet No. 71/2013 dated 31.05.2013 filed in said Gorchuk PS Case No.
179/2012.
5.       The allegation pertaining to said Gorchuk PS Case No.179/2012 is that the
accused/petitioner No. 1, who is wife of the complainant/ respondent No. 2 and
also the daughter of the accused petitioner No. 2 lived together with the
complainant as husband and wife in his house. But, later the accused petitioner No.
2, mother of the petitioner No. 1 started visiting the house of the complainant very
frequently for which the petitioner No. 1 became insolent to him and on 30.12.2011
both the accused persons left the house of the complainant with all goods and
materials including cash amount of Rs. 25,000/-, valued ornaments amounting to
Rs. 15,000/- and clothing amounting to Rs.10,000/-. It is alleged by the
complainant that the departure of the accused petitioners were in a deceitful
manner and that when he tried to bring his wife, the petitioner No. 1, back to his
house, she not only refused to come but also threatened him over mobile phone to
kidnap him by the help of extremist.
6.       Considered the arguments advanced by the parties.
7.       The essential ingredients of Section 406 IPC are that –
         (i) entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property;
         (ii) the person entrusted with the such property or having dominion over the
              said property (a) dishonestly misappropriated or converted that property
              to his own use or (b) dishonestly used or disposed of that property or
              willfully made to suffer any other person so to do in violation
              (i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to
                   be discharged or
              (ii) of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust.
8.       The essential ingredients of Section 420 IPC is that –
         (i) there must be deception such that the accused must have deceived
              someone,
         (ii) by the said deception the accused must induce a person, (a) to deliver
              any property or (b) to make, alter or destroy the whole or part of the
              valuable security or anything which is signed or sealed and which is
              capable of being converted into valuable property,
Crl. Ptn. No. 415 of 2016                                                     Page 2 of 4

         (iii) that the accused did so dishonestly.
9.       For a person to be convicted under Section 420 IPC it has to establish not
only that the accused has cheated someone but also that by doing so the accused
had dishonestly induced the person who was cheated to deliver any property. With
regard to Section 420 IPC there has to be such deception or fraudulent or
dishonest inducement from the very beginning i.e. the mens rea / the intention in
the mind of the accused to deceive to deliver any property to any person from the
initial stage itself, whereas with regard to Section 406 IPC such deception starts
only after entrustment of the property or with any dominion over the property by
the accused and therefore, Sections 406 and 420 IPC cannot go together at the
same instance or occurrence.
10.      In the present case, apparently, the Trial Magistrate, i.e. the JMFC, Kamrup
(M), Guwahati while taking cognizance of offences under Sections 379/420/406/
506/34 IPC did not consider this aspect of the matter and mechanically without
applying his judicious mind took cognizance of the offences against the petitioners.
11.      Further, in his complaint dated 07.06.2012 being CR Case No. 2796C/2012,
with regard to the incident that occurred on 03.12.2011, the complainant i.e. the
respondent No. 2 prayed before the learned CJM, Kamrup (M), Guwahati for a
direction to the O/C of Gorchuk Police Station to register a case under Sections
379/420/406/506/34 IPC and to arrest the accused persons therein / i.e. the
petitioners herein and it is seen that the same is a complaint under Section 156(3)
Cr.P.C. But the complainant, as required under the law, by swearing an affidavit
did not state before the said CJM that before filing the said complaint on
07.06.2012 he filed an FIR before the O/C of Gorchuk Police Station under Section
154(1) of the Cr.P.C. and that it was not considered by the Gorchuk Police and
then he had approached the Superintendent of Police, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati
under Section 154(3) of the Cr.P.C., which was also not considered and without the
same being absent in the complaint, the learned CJM committed illegality in
accepting the said complaint of the complainant/respondent No. 2 and to forward
the same to the concerned police station for registering it as a police case as the
law in this regard have already been settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the
case of Sakiri Vasu -Vs- State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2008) 2 SCC 409, Mrs.
Crl. Ptn. No. 415 of 2016                                                  Page 3 of 4

Priyanka Srivastava & Another -Vs- State of Uttar Pradesh & Others reported in ()
SCC , as well as by another Bench of this Court in the case of Tarun Dev Sarma &
Another -Vs- State of Assam & others, reported in 2015 (4) GLT 413.
12.      It is also seen that while forwarding the said complaint dated 07.06.2012 of
the complainant to the O/C of Gorchuk Police Station to register it as a police case,
to investigate the same and to file report, the learned CJM, Kamrup (M), Guwahati
did not consider the delay factor in preferring the said complaint by the respondent
No. 2, where the date of occurrence of the incident was 03.12.2011 and that the
said complaint was filed only on 07.06.2012.
13.      For the reasons above, the Court is of the view that the learned JMFC,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati committed illegality in taking cognizance of the offences in
the said GR Case No. 6307/2012 arising out of Gorchuk PS Case No. 179/2012 on
the basis of the complaint lodged by the respondent No. 2 on 07.06.2012 against
the petitioners which is not sustainable under law and the Court is of the opinion
that if the proceeding of said GR Case is allowed to continue, then it would be an
abuse of the process of the Court.
14.      Accordingly, in exercise of the power conferred under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
the entire proceeding of said GR Case No. 6307/2012 arising out of Gorchuk PS
Case No. 179/2012 on the basis of the complaint lodged by the respondent No. 2
on 07.06.2012 now pending before learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Kamrup
(Metro), Guwahati including the criminal complaint dated 07.06.2012 filed by the
complainant/respondent No.2 and the Charge-Sheet No. 71/2013 dated 31.05.2013
filed in said Gorchuk PS Case No. 179/2012 are set aside and quashed for the ends
of justice.
15.      The interim order passed earlier on 06.06.2016 in the present case shall
stand merged with this order.
16.      As a result, this criminal petition stands allowed.
                                                                  JUDGE
