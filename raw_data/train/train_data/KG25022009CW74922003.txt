1.   The petitioner has filed the present writ petition assailing an award
dated 13.05.2003, passed by the Labour Court, whereby no backwages
were awarded to the petitioner by the Labour Court.
2.    The brief facts of the case, relevant for deciding the petition are:
  WP(C) No. 7492/2003                                                 Page 1 of 5

The petitioner was working diligently as final checker with the
respondent since 10.12.1991 on monthly wages of Rs. 1176/-. On
repeated demands by the petitioner to the management for providing
legal facilities, the management did not provide the same and rather
without any rhyme or reason and without issuing any notice to the
petitioner terminated her services on 3.05.1993. Even her earned
wages      from    1.04.1993 to  3.05.1993   were   not    paid  by    the
management. Aggrieved with the same, the petitioner lodged a
complaint with the Labour Department and upon reference made to
the Labour Court, the labour court held the termination as illegal and
passed an award on 13.05.2003. Aggrieved with the said award, the
petitioner preferred the present petition.
3.    A very short issue has been raised by the petitioner in the instant
petition.
4.    The contention of the counsel for the petitioner is that during the
course of the proceedings before the Labour Court, the management
offered the petitioner workman to join back her duties and she
accepted the offer of the management and resumed duty from
26.11.2002 and is still continuing with the job. Although she resumed
 WP(C) No. 7492/2003                                             Page 2 of 5

her job, so the tribunal rightly did not order reinstatement, but the
tribunal erred in not awarding backwages to the petitioner. In support
of this contention, the counsel relied on the judgment of the Apex
Court in Workman of Calcutta Dock Labour Board and Anr. Vs.
Employers in relation to Employers in Relation to Calcutta Dock
Labour Board and Ors. – AIR 1973 SC 2251. The counsel also
urges that prior to making departure from ordinary rule of granting full
backwages on reinstatement, some compelling or extraordinary
circumstances in that regard are required to be mentioned by the
tribunal. In support of this contention, the counsel relied on the
judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in
Insurance          Employee’s     Association    vs.    Life  Insurance
Corporation of India reported in 1995 (70) FLR 851 (Bom).
5.     I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the
record.
6.     It is no more res integra that when it is clearly established that
the order of the management terminating the services of the workman
is illegal then the rule is reinstatement with full backwages and for any
deviation from the said rule, the learned tribunal is required to give
  WP(C) No. 7492/2003                                             Page 3 of 5

reasons. Be that as it may, it is equally well settled that when an
employer offers the employee to resume his services and the workman
resumes his service then the workman is entitled to backwages from
the date of termination of service till the date when he finally resumes
his job. In this regard, the Hon’ble Apex Court in Manorma Verma v.
State of Bihar, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 671, observed as under:
              4. We do not see any justification for the High Court not
              allowing the appellant back wages after it came to the
              conclusion that the termination was illegal. Ordinarily, the
              consequential order of grant of back wages must follow,
              unless there are reasons on record which would justify a
              departure from the normal order. We do not see any
              reasons on record to come to the conclusion that the
              appellant was not entitled to back wages. There is also
              nothing on record to show that during the period she was
              out of service, she was gainfully employed elsewhere. In
              the circumstances we allow this appeal and set aside that
              part of the High Court’s order by which the appellant was
              denied back       wages and award her back       wages from
              the date of termination of service till she was reinstated in
              service under the impugned order of the High Court. The
              appellant will be paid her back wages within three months
              from today. There will be no order as to costs.
7.    From the above discussion, it is clear that the tribunal erred in
not awarding backwages to the petitioner and even if it was felt that
the petitioner was not entitled to backwages, it should have at least
recorded reasons for the same. Considering the fact that the petitioner
workman joined services with the respondent on 10.12.1991, her
services being illegally terminated on 3.05.1993 and later she resumed
 WP(C) No. 7492/2003                                                     Page 4 of 5

services w.e.f. 26.11.2002 and also considering that her earned wages
from 1.04.1993 to 3.05.1993 were also not paid to her, I feel that she is
entitled to 50 % backwages from the date of termination of her
services on 3.05.1993 till resumption on her job on 26.11.2002.
Further, the respondent is directed to pay her earned wages from
1.04.1993 to 3.05.1993.
8.     In view of the above discussion, the petition is disposed of with
the above directions.
