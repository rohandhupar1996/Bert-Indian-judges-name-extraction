Date of Judgment                            :31.07.2017
                          JUDGMENT AND ORDER( ORAL)
           Heard Mr. M Das, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.
MR Adhikari, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the
respondent Nos. 1, 3 and 4. Also heard Mr. RK Talukdar, the learned
counsel appearing for the Accountant General, Assam.
2.         Against the writ petition, the respondent No.2 has filed affidavit-
in-opposition on 21.4.2017. As for the remaining respondents, Mr. MR
Adhikari seeks some time for filing a response in the matter. However,
considering the issue involved, I am of the considered opinion that this
case can be disposed of at this stage.
3.       Brief facts of the case for disposal may be narrated. The petitioner
was appointed as Lower Division Accountant on 26.11.1981 under the
establishment of the Executive Engineer, PWD, Tinsukia , Building
Division, Tinsukia. He was thereafter promoted to the post of Upper
Division Assistant vide office order No.101 of 2006-07 dated 4.12.2006.
4.           Upon nearing his superannuation as per the service records, the
respondent No. 4 on 19.8.2016 informed the petitioner that he was due
for supernnuation on 30.9.2016 and summoned him to attend concerned
office for finalization of the pension paper.
        WP (C) No. 388 of 2017                            Page 2 of 5

5.          However, to the surprise of the petitioner, the respondent No.2
vide communication dated 15.12.2016 wrote to the respondent No.4
stating that certain defects have been found in the pension case of the
petitioner. It was stated that as per the HSLC certificate submitted by the
petitioner, his date of birth would work out to 01.12.1955 and taking that
date, the petitioner was due to retire on 31.12.2015 on attaining the age
of superannuation. As such, his retirement on 30.9.2016 was clearly an
over-stay of the service period. Recovery was therefore required to be
made for the excess drawal of pay and allowance            for the period he
overstayed in service. The petitioner pension papers were thus returned
back for necessary action.
6.      Aggrieved, the petitioner is before this Court and as may be noticed
the office of the Accountant General has responded to the writ petition
which otherwise has some reflection as contained in the communication
dated 15.12.2016.
7.          Appearing for the writ petitioner, Mr. M Das submits that the
petitioner is in no way responsible for being released on superannuation
on 30.9.2016. In fact, the Departmental authorities had informed the
petitioner about the date of his retirement in the communication dated
19.8.2016 and on the basis of which the petitioner gave his co-operation
as was demanded. He submits that the custodian of the records is the
Department itself and based on which the petitioner has been informed
that necessary process was being taken to retire him on superannuation
on 30.9.2016. Such being the case, the petitioner cannot be held liable
and much less be made liable to refund the alleged excess drawal of pay
       WP (C) No. 388 of 2017                              Page 3 of 5

and allowances. Mr. Das also submits that after the petitioner
superannuated on 30.9.2016, the respondents have withheld all the
pension benefits due to the petitioner on the ground of overstaying of
service period. Having no option, the petitioner has come before this Court
for necessary direction. Mr. M Das in support of his submissions has relied
upon the decision of the Apex Court rendered in the case of State of
Punjab –vs- Rafiq Masih & Ors reported in (2015) 4 SCC 334 . Mr. M Das
submits that the issue of making recovery from a retired employee so far
as the petitioner’s case is concerned is covered by the said judgment. The
Apex Court in this case held that recovery from an employee belonging to
Class -3 or Class-4 (Group-C and Group-D) would not be permissible in
law and also recovery from a retired employee who was due to retire
within one year of the order of recovery amongst others. He submits that
since the overstay period in service by the petitioner in the instant case
was for about 9 months, denial of pensionary benefit to the petitioner and
to make recovery from such benefits is therefore not sustainable in law.
8.       I have considered the submissions made by the parties and I have
perused the relevant materials including the decision of the Apex Court in
the case of Rafiqu Masih (supra).
9.      As submitted by the petitioner, it is a settled principle of law that if
the overstay in service of an employee concerned is on account of the
mistake on the part of the employer and not a fault on the part of the
employee, any recovery from such employee would not be permissible as
held by the Apex Court. In the instant case as well, the petitioner himself
was informed by the respondent authorizes that he would be retiring on
superannuation on 30.9.2016 and was accordingly released from service
       WP (C) No. 388 of 2017                               Page 4 of 5

on that date. However, upon detection of the wrong calculation of the
Departmental authority by the office of Accountant General, the
petitioner’s pension was returned and recovery of the excess drawal of
pay and allowance contemplated.
10.           Having regard to the      facts in its entirety as well as the
circumstances including the decision rendered by the Apex Court in the
case of Rafiq Masih (supra), I am of the considered opinion that the
petitioner has succeeded in making out a case for interference of this
Court. In that view of the matter, the impugned communication dated
15.12.2016 (Annexure-D) made by the Senior Accounts Officer to the
respondent No.4 is hereby set aside.
11.        Considering the facts petitioner was released on superannuation
on 30.9.2016, the respondent authorities shall immediately take necessary
steps for finalization of his pension amount due as expeditiously as
possible. The Public Works Department shall forward the pension papers
to the respondent No.2 (Accountant General Office, Assam) within a
period of 45 days from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order
and the respondent No.2 shall calculate the entitlement of the petitioner
and accord necessary sanction/ authoritisation within a period of 3(three)
weeks thereafter.
12.       With the above observation and direction, the writ petition stands
disposed of. No costs.
