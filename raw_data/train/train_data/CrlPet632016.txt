                                           BEFORE
                HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
13.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Bapan Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.
    B.B. Gogoi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam appearing for the State
    respondent No. 1.        Also heard Mr. KLR Yangthan, learned counsel for the
    respondent No. 2.
             The petitioner No. 1 and the respondent No. 2 had a love affair and they
    eloped on 13.07.2015. The petitioner No. 2, the mother of respondent No. 2 on
    13.07.2015 itself lodged an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of Basistha Police
    Station alleging that the petitioner No. 1 might have kidnapped her daughter/
    respondent No. 2, whom she allegedly claimed to be a minor. Accordingly,
    Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 under section 366(A) IPC was registered. The
    Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge No. 2., Kamrup (M), Guwahati by its
    order dated 19.10.2015 passed in B.A. No. 796/2015, granted pre-arrest bail to
    the petitioner No. 1. As police recovered the victim girl from possession of the
    petitioner No. 1, he was arrested by Basistha Police on 26.11.2015 in connection
    with said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 and later by order dated 15.12.2015
    passed in BA No. 1808/2015, this Court granted him bail.
             In the meanwhile, the petitioner No. 1 got married to the respondent No.
    2 and it is submitted by the petitioner No. 1 that as per the birth certificate issued
    by the Health Department of the State, the date of birth of the respondent No. 2
    is 04.02.1997 and on the date of lodging the said FIR on 13.7.2015, she was
    more than 18 years old.
             The petitioner No.2/the informant of said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015
    and the mother of the respondent No. 2 on 09.12.2015 sworn an affidavit stating
    that her daughter/respondent No. 2 had willingly gone with the petitioner No. 1
    and got married to him and that due to misunderstanding, she lodged the FIR
    pertaining to said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 and that since her daughter
    Crl. Ptn. No. 63 of 2016                                                  Page 1 of 3

expressed that she loves the petitioner No. 1 and wants to live with him as
husband and wife, to which she does not have any objection, the petitioner No.2
in the said affidavit stated that for the purpose of amicable settlement between
her, the informant and the petitioner No. 1, the alleged accused; she does not
want to pursue with said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 any further. The
petitioner No. 2 also submitted that she has no objection if this Court quashes the
proceeding of said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 as her daughter/respondent
No. 2, is happily wedded and living together with petitioner No. 1 as husband and
wife. Hence, this criminal petition by the petitioner No. 1, the accused of Basistha
PS Case No. 797/2015 as well as by the petitioner No.2, the informant of said
Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015.
         Considered the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the
parties.
         From the birth certificate adduced by the parties to this petition, it is seen
that the victim girl, respondent No. 2 was 18 years and 5 months old on the date
of the incident on 13.07.2015 and, as such, she was a major on the said date. of
the incident. Moreover, petitioner No.1 and the respondent No.2 are presently
living together as husband and wife on being happily wedded. The mother of the
respondent No.2/the informant of said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015
categorically submitted that as her daughter is living happily with the petitioner
No. 1 as husband and wife, she does not have any grievance against the alleged
accused, petitioner No.1.
         In the present case, both the petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 and the respondent
No.2 have settled their dispute amicably and the offence involved in this case is
private in nature. The accused petitioner No. 1 has already married the victim girl/
respondent No.2. Further, it is also seen that because of such compromise
between the parties, the possibility of conviction of the petitioner No. 1 in said
Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 is remote and bleak as the accused petitioner
No.1 and the victim girl/respondent No.2 are living together as husband and wife
and continuation of the said Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 under Section 366(A)
IPC would put both the accused and the respondent No. the victim to great
oppression and prejudice and injustice would be caused to them, if the
Crl. Ptn. No. 63 of 2016                                                  Page 2 of 3

proceeding of said criminal case is not quashed, despite full and complete
settlement and compromise between the victim and the accused.
         For the reasons above, the Court is of the view that if said criminal
proceeding is allowed to continue against the accused petitioner No. 1, it would
be unfair and contrary to the interest of justice and such continuation of said
Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 against the accused petitioner would tantamount
to abuse of the process of law because of the settlement and compromise
between the victim and the accused. As such, the court is of the opinion that to
secure the ends of justice, it would be appropriate to put an end to the said
criminal proceeding pertaining to Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 under Section
366(A) IPC against the accused petitioner No.1 for the ends of justice.
         Accordingly, in exercise of the power under Section 482 CrPC, the
proceeding of Basistha Police Station Case No. 797/2015 (correspondent to GR
No. 620/2015) under section 366(A) IPC against the accused petitioner No.1 is
hereby set aside and quashed for the ends of justice and consequently, the FIR
dated 13.07.2015 lodged by the informant/petitioner No.2 pertaining to said
Basistha PS Case No. 797/2015 is also set aside and quashed.
         With the aforesaid observation and direction this criminal petition stands
allowed.
                                                              JUDGE
