                                O R D E R (CAV)
         Heard Mr. Debajyoti Talukdar, learned counsel for the petitioners. Also
heard Mr. H. Sarma, learned Addl. Public Prosecutor for the State, respondent No.
1 and Mr. Kanak Sarma, learned counsel assisted by Mr. Ditul Das, learned counsel
for the respondent No.2.
2)       M/s. Kiron Transport Private Limited, Guwahati deals with selling of vehicles
manufactured by Tata Motors and the petitioner No. 1 is its Managing Director,
whereas the petitioner No. 2 is its General Manager.
3)       The respondent No. 2/complainant purchased a TATA Ace Magic Vehicle
from said M/s. Kiron Transport Private Limited, Guwahati on 09.07.2009 for an
amount of Rs. 2,58,000/- through Tata Motors Finance Limited. The said motor
vehicle is hypothecated with the said Finance Company Limited. For such finance
of said vehicle of the respondent No. 2 bearing Registration No. AS18C 1239,
Engine No. 275IDI05FQZS56512 and Chassis No. MAT4451119VF13798 an

 Crl. Ptn. No. 263 of 2014                                               Page 2 of 7

company that financed his said vehicle, in 47 equated monthly installments. As the
respondent No. 2/borrower, defaulted in making payments of the monthly
installments, the Tata Motor Finance Limited invoked the Arbitration Clause as per
the terms and conditions incorporated in said agreement dated 10.07.2009
between it and the respondent No. 2 and in the said Arbitration Proceeding No.
TMFL/9478/2012, the Arbitrator on 07.05.2012 passed an interim order and on
17.12.2012 passed the final award, in favour of said Tata Motors Finance Limited
and against the respondent No. 2.
4)       Thereafter, the respondent No. 2 on 21.03.2013 as a complainant filed a
criminal complaint in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Goalpara being
C R No. 197C/2013 against four persons that includes (i) the present petitioner No.
1; (ii) General Manager of M/s. Kiron Transport Private Limited; (iii) General
Manager of Tata Motors Limited and (iv) General Manager of Tata Motors Finance
Limited alleging commission of offences under Sections 120(B)/420/406/468/34 IPC
against them. After receipt of said criminal complaint in CR No. 197C/2013, the
learned CJM Goalpara transferred the said complaint to the Court of learned
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Goalpara for its disposal. The learned Trial
Magistrate i.e. the Addl. CJM, Goalpara on 03.04.2013 after recording the
statement of the complainant/borrower/respondent No. 2 under Section 200 CrPC,
by his order dated 12.04.2013 took cognigance of the offences under Sections
120(B)/420 IPC against all three accused named in said complaint, including the
present petitioners and issued summons for their appearance in the said case.
5)       It is submitted that petitioner No. 1 being the Managing Director of M/s.
Kiron Transport Private Limited and the petitioner No. 2 being its General Manager,
are not connected with the day to day affairs of the said Company and as such they
cannot be roped in for committing any such offences as alleged by the
complainant. It is also submitted that the complainant made false allegations that
M/s. Kiron Transport Private Limited took an amount of Rs. 10,000/- from him for
making route permit and registration of his said vehicle, which cannot be accepted
as the complainant is a resident of Goalpara, as such registration of his vehicle and
route permit should be made before the District Transport Officer at Goalpara only
 Crl. Ptn. No. 263 of 2014                                               Page 3 of 7

and the complainant failed to place any document to substantiate his claim except
making mere statement.
6)       For all these the petitioners submitted that as there is no specific allegations
against them, since they are not connected to day to day affairs of M/s. Kiron
Transport Private Limited and on the basis of false allegations made by the
complainant, the learned Addl. CJM, Goalpara committed illegality in taking
cognigance of the offences under Sections 120(B)/420 IPC against them by the
impugned order dated 12.04.2013 in said CR Case No. 197C/2013 and that the
same was issued in violation of the provisions of law, it is submitted by the
petitioners that the impugned order dated 12.04.2013 as well as the proceeding of
said CR Case No. 197C/2013 should be set aside and quashed against them.
7)       Mr. K. Sarma appearing on behalf of the complainant/respondent No. 2
submitted that the said criminal petition is not maintainable and that fake certificate
was given to him by M/s. Kiron Transport Private Limited so as to harass him and
that all these being matter of evidence needs to be considered during the trial of
the case and therefore, there is no scope of interference of the impugned order
dated 12.04.2013 passed in said complaint case CR Case No. 197C/2013.                 Mr.
Sarma also submitted that the complaint petition of the respondent No. 2 should
not be thrown out at the initial stage as the accused persons would get the
opportunity to establish their claim during trial of the case.
8)       Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the Judgments of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Punjab National Bank and Others -Vs-
Surendra Prasad Sinha, reported in (1993) Supp SCC 499 and Anup Sarmah -Vs-
Bhola Nath Sharma, reported in (2013) 1 SCC 400. On the other hand Mr. K.
Sarma learned counsel for the respondent No.2/complainant relied on the
Judgments reported in 1992 Supp (1 ) SCC 335 [State of Haryana -Vs- Bhajan Lal
and Others], 2010 (1) GLT 588 [Jakir Hussain (Md.) and Others -Vs- Sabnam
Begum] , 2010 (1) GLT 619 [Prem Das Dahiya -Vs- Dayashish Chakma (Dr.) and
Another -Vs- Another], 2010 (2) GLT 535 [Pallav Das alias Kero Young -Vs- State of
Assam and Another] and 2011 (3) GLT 554 [Om Prakash -Vs- Central Bureau of
Investigation and Another].
 Crl. Ptn. No. 263 of 2014                                                  Page 4 of 7

9)       Heard the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and
considered the Judgments cited by them.
10)       From the perusal of the criminal complaint dated 21.03.2013 filed by the
respondent No. 2 before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Goalpara in said CR
Case No. 197C/2013, it is seen that the complainant/respondent No. 2 did not state
anything regarding the final award about the Arbitration Proceeding being No.
TMFL/9478/2012 that was drawn against him by the petitioner company except the
interim order dated 07.05.2012 passed in the said proceeding against him and
except making a statement before the trial magistrate at Goalpara in said CR Case
No. 197C/2013 that he received a notice from Bombay Court regarding his non-
payment of installments for his said vehicle while his statement was recorded under
Section 200 CrPC. This fact clearly reveals that the complainant/respondent No. 2
was fully aware of the said Arbitration Proceeding No. TMFL/9478/2012.
11)      Further from the said criminal complaint of the complainant/respondent
No.2 dated 21.03.2013 pertaining to CR Case No. 197C/2013 it is seen that the
complainant neither in his said complainant nor in his statement under Section 200
CrPC in the case, specified the person of said M/s. Kiron Transport Private Limited
against whom such accusations are alleged.
12)      Moreover, from the perusal of the complaint of said CR Case No. 197C/2013
it is seen that all the accused of the said complaint are outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the trial magistrate, i.e. the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Goalpara. But without making any statutory enquiry as required under section 202
CrPC, said trial magistrate by the impugned order dated 12.04.2013 passed in said
complaint case CR No. 197C/2013 took cognigance of the offences under Sections
120(B)/420 IPC against the present petitioners and the other accused M/S. Tata
Motor Finance Company Limited, named in the said complaint and issued summons
to them for their appearance in the said case.
13)      After the amendment of CrPC, by the Amendment Act of 2005, it is settled
that with regard to private complaint, it is mandatory for the trial magistrate to
postpone the issue of process against the accused persons when they are outside
its territorial jurisdiction, as it was found necessary in order to protect innocent
 Crl. Ptn. No. 263 of 2014                                              Page 5 of 7

persons from being harassed by unscrupulous persons and making it obligatory
upon the magistrate to enquire into the case himself, or to direct investigation to
be made by a police officer, or by such other person as he thinks fit for the purpose
of finding out whether or not, there was sufficient ground for proceeding against
the accused before issuing summons in such cases.
14)      Moreover, in the present case, the Trial magistrate have also failed to
consider the issue relating to delay in filing the said complaint by the
complainant/borrower/respondent No. 2 as he filed the said complaint only on
21.03.2013, though he took the delivery of the vehicle in question on 09.07.2009
and the Arbitrator passed the award in the arbitration proceeding against the
complainant on 17.12.2012 itself.
15)      In the case of Narmada Prasad Sonkar @ Ramu -Vs- Sardar Avtar Singh
Chabara & Others, reported in (2006) 9 SCC 61, the Hon’ble Apex Court have held
that –
         “If the magistrate had not followed the procedure and has failed to apply his
         mind as required by law, the order issuing process could be quashed but the
         Magistrate should be directed to reconsider the matter and pass fresh order
         in accordance with law.”
16)      For the reasons above and finding such procedural irregularities, the Court
is of the view that if the impugned order dated 12.04.2013 passed by learned
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Goalpara in the complaint case CR Case No.
197C/2013 in taking cognizance of the offences under Sections 120(B)/420 IPC and
in issuing summons to the accused persons in the said case including the petitioner
herein is allowed to continue, it would be an abuse of the process of the court and
as such, for the ends of justice, in exercise of the power vested under Section 482
CrPC, the impugned order dated 12.04.2013 passed by learned Additional Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Goalpara in the complaint case CR Case No. 197C/2013 that was
preferred by the respondent No. 2 is set aside and quashed.
17)      However, the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Goalpara shall
reconsider the matter pertaining to said complaint case being C.R. Case No.
197C/2013 of the complainant/respondent No. 2 and pass a fresh order on it in
accordance with law.

18)      With the aforesaid observation and direction this petition stands allowed.
19)      Registry shall forward a copy of this order to the Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Goalpara for his necessary use.
                                                                       JUDGE
