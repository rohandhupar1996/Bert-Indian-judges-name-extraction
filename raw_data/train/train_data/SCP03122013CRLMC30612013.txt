               counsel for the Vigilance Department.
                             This application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been
               filed challenging the order dated 27.08.2013, passed by the
               Authorised Officer, Cuttack, in Confiscation Case No.6 of 2012.
                             Learned counsel for the Vigilance Department with

               another –Vrs– State of Orissa, (2012) 51 OCR-946, submits that
               the   order   of  the  Authorized   Officer  passed   in  Confiscation
               Proceeding cannot be assailed in an application under Section 482
               Cr.P.C., in as much as, an Authorized Officer is not a Court and the
               proceeding before him being governed by a special statute like the
               Special Courts Act, 2006 and the Authorized Officer is empowered
               to deal with the confiscation of property only and not the offence,
               the present application is not maintainable.
                             Considering the submissions made and in view of the
               decision of this Court in Bipin Bihai Panda and another (supra), this
               application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is not maintainable.
                             CRLMC is accordingly dismissed.
                             Issue urgent certified copy as per rules.
