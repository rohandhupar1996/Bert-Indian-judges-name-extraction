                            JUDGMENT
                              10.08.2018
SANJEEV SACHDEVA, J. (ORAL)
1.      The petitioner seeks quashing of FIR No.94/2018 under
Sections 406/498A/506/34 IPC and Section 4 Dowry Prohibition
Act, Police Station Harsh Vihar.
2.      The subject FIR emanates out of matrimonial discord.
Petitioner No.1 is the husband of respondent No.2. Petitioner Nos.2
CRL.M.C. 4025/2018                                              Page 1 of 3

and 3 are the father-in-law and mother-in-law of the respondent No.2.
Petitioner No.4 is the brother-in-law of the respondent No.2.
3.      Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the parties have
reconciled their disputes and are amicably residing together as
husband and wife.
4.      The respondent No.2 is present in person, represented by
counsel and is identified by the Investigating Officer. She submits that
she has amicably resolved the disputes with her husband and they are
now cohabiting together. She submits that she does not wish to press
charges against the petitioners and has no objection to the quashing of
the subject FIR.
5.      In view of the fact that the proceedings emanate out of a
matrimonial discord and the parties have fully and finally settled their
disputes and have started living together and further the respondent
No.2 has stated that she does not wish to press the complaint any
further, continuation of criminal proceedings will be an exercise in
futility and justice in the case demands that the dispute between the
parties is put to an end and peace is restored; securing the ends of
justice being the ultimate guiding factor. It would be expedient to
quash the subject FIR and the consequent proceedings emanating
therefrom.
6.      In view of the above, the petition is allowed. FIR No.94/2018
CRL.M.C. 4025/2018                                             Page 2 of 3

under Sections 406/498A/506/34 IPC and Section 4 Dowry
Prohibition Act, Police Station Harsh Vihar and the consequent
proceedings emanating there from are quashed.
7.    Order Dasti under the signatures of the Court Master.
