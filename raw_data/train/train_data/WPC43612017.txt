                                          WP(C) No.4361 of 2017
                               BEFORE
        HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
           HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
26.07.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr. DK Sarmah and Mr. H Bora, learned counsel for the
        petitioners.
        Mr. S Dutta, learned senior counsel assisted by Ms.N Modi,
        learned counsel for the respondents.
        Heard on admission.
        This petition is directed against the order dated 22.6.2017
passed by the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Kolkata
whereby it has directed the petitioners to deposit Rs.70 lacs.
within four weeks in terms of Section 21 of the Recovery of the
Debts Due to Banks and Financial Act, 1993.
        It is to be noted that on 24.7.2017, we directed the
petitioners to deposit 50% of the certificate amount in the Debts
Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Kolkata, failing which the appeal
pending before it will be liable to be dismissed.
        We are informed that they have not deposited 50% of the
certificate amount. Not only this, it is to be noted that petitioners
had moved an application before the Tribunal seeking four weeks
time to comply with its order dated 22.6.2017, which has been
allowed by the Tribunal vide order dated 24.7.2017.
        For these reasons, we find no good ground to admit the
petition. It is accordingly dismissed.
              JUDGE                          CHIEF JUSTICE
