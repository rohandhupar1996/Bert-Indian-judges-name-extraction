PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
1.           Facts which are not in dispute are that the petitioner
was working as L.Naik under CISF and was deputed for duty at
a Unit of Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) at Haridwar
and on 11.02.1993 was on duty at the weigh bridge from
13:30 hrs to 21:30 hrs and that a tanker bearing No.HYW 3982
loaded with LDO came to the Unit of Bharat Heavy Electrical
Limited (BHEL) for unloading LDO. Now, the consignment had
to be weighed and the procedure followed was that while
making entry into the precincts of the unit, the loaded tanker
would be weighed at a weigh bridge and after decanting the
liquid from the tank, the empty tanker would be reweighed at
the weigh bridge.        The difference in weight of the loaded
tanker and the decanted tanker would yield the weight of the
W.P. (C) No.304/1994                                     Page 1 of 7

LDO which was delivered at the Unit. Further admitted fact is
that the booklet containing the ‘weighment slips’ was kept at
the weigh bridge. Further undisputed fact is that pertaining to
the tanker HYW 3982, two weigh slips Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit-3) and
Ex.PW-1        (Exhibit-4) were    prepared,   both    bearing       the
signatures of the petitioner. The first exhibit is a leaf out of
book No.14, vide serial No.1364 and the latter is out of the
same book, but at serial No.1367. Further admitted fact is, the
contents of the exhibit Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit-3) has cuttings and
over writings.
2.           Here onward we would record the facts in dispute,
but before that we would record that a bare perusal of Ex.PW-1
(Exhibit 3) reveals to the naked eye, that as a result of the
cuttings and overwriting an attempt has been made to convert
11220 kg into 17920 kg; this is evident from the fact that over
the first numeral ‘2’ the numeral ‘9’ has been overwritten and
the second numeral ‘1’ has been converted into the numeral
‘7’.      This is against the entry pertaining to the gross weight.
There is no corresponding entry pertaining to ‘Tare weight’.
No entry has been recorded against column ‘Net Weight’. The
second exhibit is a complete document recording gross weight
to be 17920 kg. The ‘Tare weight’ recorded is 7530 kg. Net
weight recorded is 10090 kg, which we note is an apparent
calculation mistake, for the reason 17920 kg – 7530 kg =
10390 kg and not 10090 kg.
3.           With the afore-noted admitted facts, it is time to note
the other facts with respect where-to instant writ petition
needs to be decided.
4.           It came to be reported that manipulation has been
done at the weigh bridge to facilitate a wrong recording of
actual quantity of LDO delivered through the tanker in
W.P. (C) No.304/1994                                     Page 2 of 7

question at the Unit in question. A fact finding inquiry was
conducted by a team consisting of 5 persons, one of whom
was Inspector N.K.Yadav.         A statement purportedly made by
the petitioner was recorded on 19.02.1993, as per which, the
petitioner made a confessional statement that he did so on
being induced to receive bribe in sum of `1,000/-, which he
took.
5.           The petitioner thereafter suddenly and abruptly left
the Unit and thus 2 articles of charges were framed against
him as per Memorandum dated 29.03.1993. The first article of
charge alleged against the petitioner was of accepting illegal
gratification in the sum of `1000/- while on duty by making
interpolations in the weigh slips. It was alleged that the said
act was gross misconduct and against the Rules of CISF.
Second article of charge alleged against the petitioner was of
unauthorizedly absenting from duty w.e.f. 20.02.1993 till
24.02.1993 in respect whereof it was alleged that the said act
is indicative of his negligence towards official duty and in
contravention of Rules of a disciplined Force. In the statement
of imputation it was stated that one Sh.Virender Singh has
received the money from the driver of the tanker and had
handed over the same to the petitioner as illegal gratification.
6.           The petitioner refuted the charges and disowned his
statement purportedly recorded on 19.2.1993, explaining the
two weigh slips, not disputing that he had authored the same
and that the first had cuttings and overwriting thereon, in the
written response to the charge sheet, the petitioner explained
as under:-
              “In fact, there came an L.D.O. Tanker No. HYW 3982
              on 11.2.1993 which on being weighed was found to
              be 17220 kg. In weight.       But when the driver
              pointed out that the weight was not correct I , the
              applicant, got it weighed again and it was found to
W.P. (C) No.304/1994                                     Page 3 of 7

              be 17920 kg. in weight. It was due to this reason
              that the figure 17720 kg. gross weight was
              amended to read as 17920 kg. And because there
              was correction in the Receipt No. 1364, the person
              posted at weighbridge cancelled the same and
              issued a new Receipt No. 1367 instead thereof. The
              applicant made entry of the correct weight, taken
              before him, of the L.D.O. Tanker on 11.2.1993 in the
              receipt in question and no forgery has been made in
              the figures of the weight of the said tanker therein.”
7.           At the inquiry various witnesses were examined.
Inspector N.K.Yadav, one of the 5 persons who had conducted
the preliminary inquiry proved the confessional statement
made by the petitioner on 19.2.1993. He also proved various
exhibits which were seized during preliminary inquiry which
included the two weigh slips. Shri Virender Singh deposed that
he had received `1,000/- from the driver of the tanker and had
handed over the same to the petitioner on 11.2.1993 and that
in his presence the weigh slip Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit 3) was
interpolated and as it got defaced the petitioner prepared the
weigh slip Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit 4).
8.           The Inquiry Report indicted the petitioner and was
supplied       to   him   by   the  Disciplinary   Authority.        After
considering the response of the petitioner, who explained the
two weigh slips as per his written response to the charged
memo and pertaining to the second charge stated that being
unwell, he left for his house and wrote a leave application
which he sent by post and due to being mentally disturbed he
did not return till his family members counseled him to return,
finding no merit in the explanation, the Disciplinary Authority
levied the penalty of dismissal from service vide order dated
2.9.1993 against which the appeal filed was rejected on
29.10.1993.
9.           Original record of the inquiry which has been
produced before us has been seen.
W.P. (C) No.304/1994                                       Page 4 of 7

10.          It is urged by learned senior counsel for the petitioner
that Sh.Virender Singh, as per his testimony had facilitated the
receipt of illegal gratification stated to have been received by
the petitioner and thus it is urged that the tainted testimony of
an accomplice could not be the foundation of the indictment.
Qua the deposition of Sh.N.K.Yadav it is urged that admittedly,
Insp.N.K.Yadav was not a witness when the two weigh slips
were drawn.
11.          Suffice would it be to state that even at a criminal
trial the evidence of an accomplice is admissible, but subject
to the rule of caution requiring corroboration thereto. Thus, it
cannot be said that the testimony of Virender Singh is useless
evidence. We shall be dealing with the issue of corroboration
a little later.
12.          Qua the testimony of Insp.N.K.Yadav it has to be
noted that he was one out of a 5 member team who recorded
the statement of the petitioner on 19.2.1993 and obtained his
signatures thereon.           The incident in question is dated
11.2.1993 and it is not a case where the petitioner did not
have time to think and state what he wanted to state. But, we
shall deal with this issue a little later.
13.          Men may lie, but circumstances do not lie. The two
weigh slips Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit 3) and Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit 4) are
documents admittedly drawn up by the petitioner and his
explanation qua them has been noted by us hereinabove.
14.          The explanation is a blatant concoction and renders
an explanation which hardly inspires confidence. If indeed the
petitioner is correct and that on Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit 3) he wrongly
noted the weight to be 17220 kg and corrected the same to
17920 kg and in the process (due to overwriting) required an
uncorrected weigh slip to be drawn up the logical thing would
W.P. (C) No.304/1994                                     Page 5 of 7

be that the next leaf bearing No.1365 would have been used
and not the leaf at the serial No.1367.              This nails the
indictment against the petitioner.
15.          With reference to the confession made by the
petitioner on 19.2.1993, it has to be kept in mind that the
petitioner was fully aware of having drawn up two weigh slips
and it is apparent that he had been thinking as to whether he
could render a satisfactory explanation and finding none chose
to make a clean breast of what had happened when he
appeared at the fact finding inquiry on 19.2.1993.
16.          We have no reasons to believe that the fact finding
team would contrive a document.
17.          On the issue of corroboration to the evidence of
Virender Singh, whose testimony does show, his being an
accomplice, we find corroboration through the medium of the
two weigh slips as also the confessional statement made by
the petitioner.
18.          Suffice would it be to state that to the naked eye it is
apparent that there are two interpolations in Ex.PW-1 (Exhibit
3). The figure 11220 kg has been converted to 17920 kg. The
explanation of the petitioner of thereafter preparing Ex.PW-1
(Exhibit 4) is illusory for the reason under the circumstances
explained by the petitioner the leaf bearing No.1365 i.e. the
leaf immediately succeeding leaf No.1364 would have been
utilized and not the leaf at serial No.1367.
19.          Within the confines of credibility of evidence to
sustain a verdict of guilt at a departmental inquiry we find
sufficient credible evidence against the petitioner.
20.          It is then urged that there is no evidence of financial
loss caused to BHEL. The argument is rejected for the reason
the evidence establishes that a tanker having gross weight
W.P. (C) No.304/1994                                    Page 6 of 7

11220 kg was shown as having gross weight 17920 kg and
after unloading the weight of the tanker was 7530 kg.                 It is
apparent that an attempt was made to inflate the quantity of
LDO delivered and it is apparent that if the manipulation was
not detected BHEL would have made payment of an excess
quantity weighing 6000 kg.
21.          On    the issue    of   the   petitioner  unauthorizedly
absenting himself from duty, the explanation rendered is
worthy of no credence.            The petitioner was living in the
barracks in the unit and the Commander was also in the same
barracks.       We find it strange that the petitioner would have
written a leave application sitting in the barracks and sent it by
post, in respect whereof there is no proof, when he had the
benefit of the camp office being in the same precincts. It is
apparent that the petitioner was disturbed on account of
having no explanation for what he did and after making the
confession absconded from the unit.
22.          It is lastly urged that the penalty imposed is
disproportionate.
23.          Instances of illegal gratification hardly surface by the
very nature of the transactions being to the benefit of both
wrong doers. It has to be kept in mind that the petitioner is a
member of a Disciplined Force and thus we see no scope to
interfere with the penalty imposed.
24.          The writ petition is dismissed.
25.          No costs.
                                       PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
