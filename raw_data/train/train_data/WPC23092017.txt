                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                Heard Mr. B.D. Goswami, the learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. R. Borpujari, the learned Standing Counsel, the respondent
Nos. 7. Ms. A. Neog, the learned counsel appears for the respondent Nos. 2, 5
and 6 and Mr. M.R. Adhikari, the learned Government Advocate, Assam, appears
for the respondent Nos. 3 and 4.
2.       By this writ petition the petitioner has raised his grievance for non-
payment of his salary since the month of January, 2017, while being appointed
as Sub-Engineer (Civil) on officiating post under the establishment of the
respondent No.5. The petitioner who is a diploma holder in Civil Engineering was
initially appointed as Muster Roll Worker under the establishment of the
respondent No.3 on 25.03.1992 (Annexure-1). His service as such was continued
until he was appointed on Work Charged basis vide order dated 01.08.1995
(Anenxure-2). The petitioner thereafter was allowed to officiate as Draftsman in
the establishment of the respondent No.5 vide order dated 20.02.1997 in the pay
scale of Rs.1375-3375 per month. The said appointment was against the vacancy
caused due to the suspension of the employee concerned. The arrangement was
also made for the period the employee concerned was placed under suspension.
3.       The petitioner’s appointment as officiating Draftsman continued against
the suspension vacancy but thereafter, he was allowed to officiate temporarily as
Sub-Engineer (Civil) against existing vacant post under the establishment of the
respondent No.5 vide order dated 08.02.2016 (Annexure-6). By the said order
the petitioner was given his pay in the structure of Pay Band-2 i.e. Rs.5,200/- to
Rs.20,200/- with G.P. Rs.3,300/- per month. The petitioner thereafter pursuant
to the order dated 08.02.2016 released from the post of Work Charged
Draftsman to enable him to join in the Work Charged Sub-Engineer (Civil) under
the establishment of the respondent No.5. It may be also noticed that the order
dated 08.02.2016 was approved by the NC Hills Autonomous Council, Halflong.
The petitioner thereafter received his regular monthly salary in the pay scale as
indicated above. But, however, since the month of January, 2017, the petitioner
was not paid any salary and therefore, he submitted a representation to the
WP(C) No.2309 of 2017

                                          3
respondent No.5 for releasing his salary on 17.03.2017 (Annexure-9). In reply to
the petitioner’s representation the respondent No.5 wrote to the petitioner
informing him that salary was not being paid to him since the respondent No.7
i.e. the Treasury Officer, Halflong, objected to his salary cheque for the month of
January, 2017. It was, however, stated that appropriate reply was given to the
Treasury Officer by the respondent No.5 on 10.03.2017 (Annexure-12), informing
him that the petitioner was employed as a work charged staff and his service
was not regularised. The arrangement was temporary and it was done on the
basis of the approval given by the Autonomous Council authority for smooth
functioning of development works in the engineering cell of the department
concerned. The said communication was made on 29.03.2017 (Annexure-10) and
the communication dated 10.03.2017 was also enclosed along with the said
letter.
4.       Mr. B.D. Goswami, the leaned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, submits
that the respondent authorities concerned have illegally withheld the salary of
the petitioner for the month of January, 2017. The petitioner has been allowed to
officiate as Sub-Engineer (Civil) against the existing vacant post under the
establishment of the respondent No.5 pursuant to the approval given by the NC
Hills Autonomous Council. The petitioner in terms of the order dated 08.02.2016
has also been allowed to draw his pay in the structure of Pay Band-2 i.e.
Rs.5,200/- to Rs.20,200/- with G.P. Rs.3,300/- per month. Therefore, the
respondent No.7 could not have withheld the pay of the petitioner. He submits
that the petitioner has been working in different posts on work charged basis and
has not been regularised. As contended by the respondent No.7, the
communication dated 10.03.2017 made by the respondent No.5 clearly shows
that the petitioner has not been regularised to the post in question and the same
has been done as an arrangement on temporary basis with the approval of the
Autonomous Council. Mr. Goswami, therefore, prays before this Court that the
respondent authorities should be directed to release the salary of the petitioner.
5.       Appearing for the respondent No.7 Mr. R. Borpujari, the learned counsel,
submits that the petitioner having been appointed only on work charged basis
cannot be given the regular pay scale as indicated in the order dated 08.02.2016.

                                          4
He submits that the Grade pay of Rs.3,300/- can only be given to a regular
employee of the department.
6.        Ms. A. Neog, the learned counsel appearing for the Autonomous Council
submits that since a clarification has already been made by the respondent
concerned on 10.03.2017, the respondent No.7 has to accordingly act upon the
clarification on his part.
7.        I have considered the submissions made by the parties. It is seen that
the respondents are yet to file an affidavit-in-opposition in the matter, but,
however, considering the fact that the dispute relates to non-payment of salary
to the petitioner since the month of January, 2017, and the fact that the
petitioner has not been regularised in service through he was posted as a work
charged Sub-Engineer (Civil) on officiating basis under the establishment of the
respondent No.5, in my considered opinion the writ petition can be disposed of
with a direction to the respondent authorities concerned, more particularly, to
the respondent Nos. 5 and 7 to settle the matter and pay the monthly salary of
the petitioner in terms of his entitlement since the petitioner admittedly is a
work-charged employee under the respondent No.5 establishment on officiating
basis. The respondent authorities concerned will naturally have to take into
consideration the arrear salaries of the petitioner from the month of January,
2017 as well as the current salary.
8.        It is ordered accordingly.
9.       The entire exercise shall be carried out by the respondent Nos. 5 and 7
within a period of 3 (three) weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of
this order.
10.      With the above observations and directions, the writ petition stands
disposed of. No cost.
                                                                        JUDGE
