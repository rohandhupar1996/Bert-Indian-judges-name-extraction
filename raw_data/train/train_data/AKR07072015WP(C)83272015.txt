Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         Aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated
      10.04.2015 passed by the Collector, Puri, opposite party no.3, in Fishery
      Misc.   Case  No.167/2014,     vide   Annexure-7,   more    particularly, the
      directions made in paragraph (e), (f) and (h) of the said order, the

                                      2
petitioner has filed the present writ petition. By the said order, the
opposite party no.3 held that the petitioner is liable to pay Government
Revenue of Rs.8,00,000/- as calculated by the Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad,
opposite party no.4 prior to take possession of the sairat. It was further
directed that after completion of lease period on 30.06.2015, the
petitioner and opposite party no.5 may approach for sub-lease of the
source.
2.             Sans details the short facts of the case of the petitioner is
that the petitioner-society is a registered cooperative society. The
members of the society are poor fishermen. They eke out their livelihood
by fishing. The members of the petitioner-society consists of 117
fishermen, who are permanent resident of village Srirampur, Balinasi &
Maleswari. From 1959, the Talarihuda Jano Sairat (hereinafter referred to
as ‘Sairat’) is in possession of the fishermen of villagers of Srirampur.
During the period of 2014-15, the Collector, Puri, opposite party no.3
recommended the name of the petitioner to the Orissa State Fishermen’s
Cooperative Federation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘FISHFED’),
opposite party no.2 for sub-leasing the Sairat in favour of the petitioner-
society. Thereafter, the opposite party no.2 directed the petitioner-society
to deposit an amount of Rs.38,533/-. The Secretary of the Society
deposited the said amount on 5.9.2014 and 24.09.2014 respectively. An
agreement was executed on 24.11.2014 for an area of Ac.229.78 decimal
in favour of the petitioner, vide Annexure-4. Thereafter, the opposite party
no.2 sent a letter to the Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad, opposite party no.4 to

                                          3
handover the possession of the Sairat to the petitioner-society. But then,
the Sairat was not handed over to the petitioner-society by the opposite
party no.4. The Secretary of the petitioner-society approached the
opposite party no.3, whereafter a letter was sent on 02.01.2015 to the
Sub-Collector, Puri to complete the process and handover the possession
of the Sairat to the petitioner. While the matter stood thus, the petitioner
received a notice in Fishery Misc. Case No.167 of 2014 filed before the
Collector, Puri by the opposite party no.5, another fishermen co-operative
Society. Opposite party no.5 is a newly formed society, which has no locus
standi to interfere in the matter. The name of opposite party no.5 has not
been recommended by the competent authority for the period of 2014-15.
However, the opposite party no.5 initiated the case with an oblique motive
of obstructing delivery of possession to the petitioner-society. Further case
of the petitioner is that it filed a writ petition, i.e., W.P.(C) No.990 of 2015
before this Court for a direction to the Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad to
handover the possession of Sairat. The said writ petition was disposed of
on 13.02.2015 with a direction to the opposite party no.3 to dispose of
Fishery Misc. Case No.167 of 2014 within ten days. Since the matter was
not disposed of within the stipulated time, the petitioner has filed an
application for Contempt of Court for violation of the order of this Court.
But then, the case was not disposed of. Again the petitioner filed another
writ petition, i.e., W.P.(C) No.6174 of 2015. During pendency of the writ
petition, the Fishery Misc. Case No.167 of 2014 was disposed of by the
Collector, Puri on 10.04.2015. Thus the aforesaid writ petition has become
infructuous. By order dated 10.04.2015, the Collector, Puri directed the

                                       4
petitioner to deposit Rs.8,00,000/- or more as calculated by the
Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad prior to handover the possession of the Sairat
in question to the petitioner-society. Further direction was made that after
completion of lease period on 30.06.2015, the parties may approach for
sub-lease of the sairat source. With this factual scenario, the present writ
petition is filed.
3.              Pursuant to issuance of notice, the opposite party no.5 has
entered appearance, but no counter affidavit has been filed. Also no
counter affidavit has been filed by the opposite party nos.1 to 4.
4.              Heard Mr. S.R. Patnaik, learned counsel for the petitioner,
learned Additional Government Advocate for the opposite party nos.1 to 4
and Mr. K.B. Kar, learned counsel for the opposite party no.5.
5.              Mr. Patnaik, learned counsel for the petitioner argued with
vehemence that the name of the petitioner-society was recommended by
the authority for the year 2014-15 to the FISHFED. Pursuant to the
direction of the Managing Director, FISHFED, opposite party no.2, the
Secretary of the petitioner-society deposited an amount of Rs.38,533/- on
5.9.2014 and 24.09.2014 respectively. Thereafter an agreement was
executed on 24.11.2014 in respect of the Sairat for an area of Ac.229.78
decimals in favour of the petitioner-society, vide Annexure-4. The opposite
party no.2 issued a letter to the opposite party no.4 to handover the Sairat
to the petitioner-society and also sent a copy to the Collector, Puri. Since
the Sairat was not handed over to the petitioner, the petitioner has

                                        5
approached this Court in W.P.(C) No.990 of 2015. Though a direction was
made by this Court on 13.02.2015 to dispose of the Fishery Misc. Case
No.167 of 2014 to the Collector, Puri, but the same was not disposed of.
Thereafter, the petitioner filed an application for contempt. Again the
petitioner filed another writ petition, i.e., W.P.(C) No.6174 of 2015. At this
juncture, the Fishery Misc. Case No.167 of 2014 was disposed of by the
Collector, Puri, opposite party no.3 on 10.04.2015 and as such W.P.(C)
No.6174 of 2015 has become infructuous. He further submitted that at no
point of time any letter was issued to the petitioner-society to pay an
amount of Rs.8,00,000/-. The petitioner-society is not aware of any
outstanding dues. He further submitted that since the case of the
petitioner was duly recommended by the opposite party no.3 to the
opposite party no.2 and thereafter the petitioner-society has deposited an
amount of Rs.38,533/-, agreement was executed, the opposite party no.3
committed an illegality in holding that the petitioner-society is liable to pay
Government Revenue of Rs.8,00,000/- as calculated by opposite party
no.4. He further submitted that the opposite party no.3 committed
manifest illegality and impropriety in observing that after completion of
lease period on 30.06.2015, the parties may approach for sub-lease of the
source within the provisions. He further submitted that the opposite party
no.5-Society does not represent the villagers of Srirampur. Opposite party
no.5-Society consists of 11 numbers of villagers of Srirampur along with
the villagers of Naba. The members of opposite party no.5 are not
traditional fishermen.

                                       6
6.            Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate supports
the order dated 10.04.2015 passed by the Collector, Puri in Fishery Misc.
Case No.167/2014.
7.            Mr. K.B. Kar, learned counsel for the opposite party no.5
submitted that all the members of the petitioner-society are not
permanent resident of village Srirampur. The members of the opposite
party no.5-society have no alternative livelihood. The Sairat belongs to
them and if sub-lease is granted in favour of the petitioner-society, the
members of the opposite party no.5 will be deprived of their livelihood. He
further submitted that some members of the petitioner-society are minors
and dead persons.
8.            In course of hearing, when a query be made by this Court as
to   whether    the   petitioner-society would     deposit   an  amount    of
Rs.8,00,000/- before the opposite party no.4, Mr. Patnaik, learned counsel
for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner-society is ready and willing
to deposit the said amount. In the aforesaid context, this Court is required
to examine the rival claims of petitioner vis-à-vis opposite party no.5. The
name of the petitioner-society was recommended by the opposite party
no.3 to the opposite party no.2. Pursuant to the direction of the opposite
party no.2, the petitioner-society deposited an amount of Rs.38,533/- on
5.9.2014 and 29.09.2014 respectively. An agreement was entered into
between the parties on 24.11.2014. The opposite party no.3 by letter
dated   2.1.2015    directed   the  Sub-Collector,   Puri  to  handover   the
possession of the Sairat source to the petitioner-society. But then, the

                                         7
opposite party no.5 initiated Fishery Misc. Case No.167/2014. By an
elaborate order dated 10.04.2015 vide Annexure-7, the opposite party
no.3 held as follows:-
             “       xxx                   xxx                  xxx
             In view of the above forgoing discussions it is views as:-
             a)   O.P. No.1 is the original society & due to some disagreements
                  among the original members, the petitioner is newly formed.
             b)   O.P. No.1 has already deposited the dues and agreement is
                  already signed with FISHFED for lease, and only formal handing
                  over is required.
             c)   Lease period is about to expire.
             d)   An order has already been passed since end of 2002 in the
                  Court of Collector, Puri for proposed lease of the suit source in
                  favour of O.P. No.1 Srirampur & due to dismissal in appellate
                  forum this order is uphold.
             e)   There is more than eight lakhs of rupees relating to Govt.
                  Revenue is pending with O.P. No.1 is a clear instance that the
                  source was legally enjoyed by O.P. No.1 earlier.
             f)   O.P. No.1 is liable to pay the Govt. Revenue of rupees eight
                  lakhs or more as calculated by Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad prior
                  to take possession of the land.
             g)   After realization of the amount Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad shall
                  hand over the source to O.P. No.1.
             h)   After completion of lease period on 30.06.2015 the parties may
                  approach for sub-lease of the source within the provisions.
                     Hence the petition is devoid of merit & the case is disposed
             of accordingly.”
             It is pertinent to mention here that the aforesaid order has
not been challenged by the opposite party no.5.
9.           On taking a holistic view of the matter, this Court disposes of
the writ petition with a direction to the petitioner-society to deposit an
amount of Rs.8,00,000/- (rupees eight lakhs) within a period of fifteen

                                              8
days         before        the Tahasildar, Krushnaprasad,  opposite  party no.4.
Thereafter the opposite party no.4 shall handover the Sairat to the
petitioner-society forthwith. So far as the observation made by the
opposite party no.3 in paragraph (h) of the order, this Court is of the
opinion that since the petitioner-society has not taken over the possession
of the Sairat till yet, after depositing the necessary amount as directed by
the Collector, Puri, opposite party no.3 vide order dated 10.04.2015 under
Annexure-7 before the opposite party no.4, the petitioner-society will
operate the Sairat till end of June, 2016. Thereafter, the Collector, Puri,
opposite party no.3 shall consider the rival claims of the respective parties
and take a decision to lease out the Sairat.
                                                     ……………………………….
