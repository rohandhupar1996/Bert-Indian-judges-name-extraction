Date of Judgment                         :27.07.2017
                       JUDGMENT AND ORDER( ORAL)
       Heard Mr. MK Choudhury, the learned senior counsel appearing for
the writ petitioner and Mr. S Bora, the learned Standing Counsel for the
GMC on behalf of the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Mr. HK Sharma, the
learned counsel appears for the respondent No.4.
2.         The challenge made by the writ petitioner by this writ petition is
to the order dated 12.12.2011 by which his promotion to the post of
Assistant Executive Engineer was recalled by the respondent authorities
on the ground that it was in violation of the judgment and order dated
24.11.2009 passed in WP ( C) No. 1391 of 2005.
3.           It may be noticed that WP (C) No. 1391 of 2005 was filed by
the respondent No.4 wherein he had challenged the promotion of the
private respondent therein who were promoted and posted as Assistant
       WP (C) No. 6544 of 2011                           Page 2 of 8

Executive Engineer under the GMC on deputation. The direction given in
the said writ petition was for filling up all the vacant posts of Assistant
Executive Engineers (Civil) including the post held by the private
respondents therein on regular basis in terms of the Gauhati Municipal
Corporation Engineering Services Rules, 2003 (Service Rules of 2003)
which was published in the Assam Gazette on 27.1.2004. The said Rules
same into force w.e.f. the date of publication in the Assam Gazette. The
judgment and order dated 24.11.2009 passed in WP (C) No.1391 of 2005
was thereafter challenged by the writ petitioner therein under Writ Appeal
No.402 of 2010. The writ appeal came to be disposed of by the writ
appellate Court on 21.1.2011 by directing the respondent authorities to fill
up the post of Assistant Executive Engineers by promoting the Assistant
Engineers on the basis of seniority –cum- merit and experience as
provided in the Service Rules of 2003.
 4.           Appearing for the writ petitioner, Mr. MK Choudhury submits
that there is nothing wrong with the order of promotion given to the
petitioner vide order dated 18.12.2009 which was recalled by the
respondent authorities vide order dated 12.12.2011. He submits that prior
to issuance of the impugned order dated 12.12.2011, a show cause notice
was issued to him whereby it was stated that his promotion order was
       WP (C) No. 6544 of 2011                            Page 3 of 8

issued in violation of the judgment and order dated 24.11.2009 passed in
WP (C) No.1391 of 2005. The petitioner against the show cause notice
filed his reply on 3.8.2011 stating that as per the final gradation list of
Assistant Engineers (Civil) which was published on 25.3.2009, the name of
the petitioner was at serial No.1. The said gradation list was put to
challenge in WP (C) No.1616 of 2009 and vide judgment and order dated
1.9.2009, the gradation list was upheld. Morevover, in the writ petition
preferred by the respondent No.4 herein, the petitioner was never made a
party and therefore the case of the petitioner is outside the purview of the
writ petition as well as the connected Writ appeal. However, the
respondent authorities rejected his reply and recalled his promotion order.
5.          The learned senior counsel further submits that pursuant to the
gradation list published on 25.3.2009 for the post of Assistant Engineer
(Civil), another gradation list was published on 31.9.2009 in which the
name of the petitioner was retained at serial No.1 of the list. Considering
the fact that the direction even otherwise by the earlier writ court as well
as the writ appellate court was to consider Assistant Engineer for
promotion as per the service rules which provides that promotion has to
be made on the basis of seniority- cum- merit, the petitioner therefore has
been rightly promoted to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer vide
order dated 18.12.2009.
        WP (C) No. 6544 of 2011                            Page 4 of 8

6.         Mr. S Bora appearing for the GMC submits that prior to the
promotion of the petitioner, the judgment and order dated 24.11.2009
passed in WP (C) No. 1391 of 2005 was not placed before the authority
concerned and therefore the promotion of the petitioner to Assistant
Executive Engineer had to be recalled. He submits that the direction of the
writ court as well as the writ appellate Court was to consider the
promotion of the Assistant Engineer (Civil) for promotion to the posts of
Assistant Executive Engineer in terms of the Service Rules as per seniority-
cum- merit and performance and such procedure not been adopted, the
promotion of the petitioner had to be recalled.
7.   Appearing for the respondent No.4, Mr. HK Sharma, the learned
counsel adopts the arguments and submissions made by the learned
counsel for the GMC. He submits that the respondent authorities in
promoting the petitioner to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer at the
relevant time failed to abide by the decision of this Court rendered in WP
(C) No.1391 of 2005 and in the writ appeal. The learned counsel by
referring to the promotion order of the writ petitioner dated 18.12.2009
submits that the order of promotion at the face of it indicates that no
process was undertaken in terms of the relevant service rules and
        WP (C) No. 6544 of 2011                           Page 5 of 8

therefore the promotion of the petitioner was rightly recalled vide order
dated 12.12.2011.
8.        The senior counsel Mr. MK Choudhury has drawn the attention of
this Court to the order dated 19.6.2012 by which in pursuant to the order
passed by this Court on 10.1.2012 in the instant case, the impugned order
recalling the promotion of the petitioner to the post of Assistant Executive
Engineer on 12.12.2011 was stayed. The learned senior counsel has also
produced an order dated 25.5.2015 and submit that the writ petitioner in
the meantime pursuant to the selection held on 14.8.2014 and approved
on 2.6.2014 was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer w.e.f.
25.5.2015.
9.        I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
materials available on record. It may be noticed herein that the promotion
of the petitioner vide order dated 18.12.2009 is not under challenge.
Furthermore, the subsequent order passed on 25.5.2015 whereby the
petitioner was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer is also not
under challenge. In such circumstance, what is to be seen as to whether
the order dated 12.12.2011 by which the promotion of the petitioner to
the post of Assistant Executive Engineer which was recalled can be
justified. The judgment and order dated 24.11.2009 passed in WP (C)
1391 of 2005 was to the effect that the promotion to the post of Assistant
        WP (C) No. 6544 of 2011                           Page 6 of 8

Executive Engineer should be made against all the vacant post in terms of
the Service Rules of 2003. Similarly, the judgment and order rendered by
the Division Bench of this Court in the Writ Appeal No.402 of 2010 only
provides that the lying vacant post under the GMC i.e. Assistant Executive
Engineer should be filled up by promotion from the cadre of Assistant
Engineer on the basis of seniority –cum- merit and experience and other
conditions laid down in the relevant Service Rules. Although the
respondent authorities have not specifically provided the procedures under
which the petitioner was promoted to the post of Assistant Executive
Engineer, the fact remains that the petitioner as per the gradation list
dated 25.3.2009 which was challenged and upheld by this Court as well as
the subsequent gradation list dated 31.9.2009 is the senior-most
incumbent in the posts of Assistant Engineer under the respondent
authorities.   Also considering that the Service Rules of 2003 which
provides that promotion to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer is to
be made on the basis of seniority- cum- merit and performance, the
promotion of the petitioner to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer
vide order dated 18.12.2009 cannot be faulted with.
10.        Considering the facts and circumstances in its entirety with the
materials available on record, I am of the considered opinion that the
       WP (C) No. 6544 of 2011                            Page 7 of 8

impugned order dated 12.12.2011 is not justified and cannot be sustained.
In that view of the matter, the order dated 12.12.2011 (Annexure-D) is
hereby set aside.
11.          With the above directions and observations, the writ petition
stands disposed of. No cost.
