To be referred to the Reporter or not?
 VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J (ORAL)
1.           This first appeal is filed under Section 37 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 impugning the order of the court below dated
26.3.2013, by which the objections filed by the appellant-objector
challenging the Award of the arbitrator dated 21.1.2010 have been
dismissed. By the Award dated 21.1.2010, the arbitrator Justice (Retired)
M.A.Khan (appointed by the National Stock Exchange), awarded an amount
of Rs.2,48,358/- in favour of the respondent no.1 herein, claimant in the
arbitration proceedings.    The amount was awarded on account of the

which the respondent no.1/claimant maintained with the appellant/objector.
FAO 222/2013                                                                 Page 1 of 9

2.            The case of the respondent no.1-claimant in the arbitration
proceedings was that appellant without the consent of the respondent no.1
sold the following shares:
(i)    Reliance Industrial-70
(ii)   Reliance Communications 70
(iii)  RNRI 170
(iv)   Hindustan Uni Lever 190
(v)    Chambal Fertilizer 75
(vi)   Reliance Capital 8 and
(vii) Reliance Infrastructure 4
3.            Respondent no.1-claimant stated that she never gave any
authorization whatsoever to the appellant to conduct trades in these shares.
Respondent no.1 also stated that all the employees at the Varanasi Branch
who dealt with the account of the respondent no.1 were removed from
service.    Respondent no.1-claimant had contended in the arbitration
proceedings that there are no documents filed by the respondent no.1
showing placing any orders by the respondent no.1 for the transactions in
her account, no proof is shown by the appellant of the respondent no.1
visiting the office of the appellant for placing the orders which ran into 100s
in number, no proof was filed of any telephonic conversation showing
placing of orders by the respondent no.1 upon the appellant and finally no
FAO 222/2013                                                                 Page 2 of 9

proof is filed of delivery of all contract notes to respondent no.1 by the
appellant after the transactions were entered into by the appellant on behalf
of the respondent no.1.
4.           The case of the appellant in the arbitration proceedings
essentially was based upon the authorization dated 6.6.2008 allegedly to
have been signed by the respondent no.1 permitting the appellant to carry
out any trades whatsoever in the De-Mat account of the respondent no.1
maintained with the appellant.     Appellant also contended that after the
transactions were done it had sent the contract notes to the respondent no.1
by UPC and by courier. Appellant contended that any trading which was
done by it in the account of the respondent no.1 was after proper
authorization and due intimation was sent to the respondent no.1 of the
trades conducted, and the claim petition was misconceived and malafide
because actually the respondent no.1 had suffered loss in the transactions
carried out.
5.           In the Award dated 21.1.2010, the arbitrator has arrived at the
following salient conclusions:-
FAO 222/2013                                                              Page 3 of 9

(i)    The authorization dated 6.6.2008 is not an authorization which was
given by the respondent no.1 to the claimant i.e this is a fabricated
document.
(ii)   There is no proof that any instructions for trading were given by the
respondent no.1 to the branch office of the appellant at Varanasi, and which
transactions were in the months of May to August, 2008, and taken with the
aspect that on certain dates transactions were as many as 46 (24.6.2008), 181
(25.9.2008), 93 (25.7.2008) etc etc.
(iii)  There is no proof that respondent no.1 ever having personally visited
the Varanasi office of the appellant because no visitors register showing
presence of the respondent no.1 in the Varanasi office was filed by the
appellant.
(iv)   No proof is filed by the appellant of any telephonic conversation on
those days from May to August, 2008 when transactions were carried out by
the appellant as per the alleged instructions of the respondent no.1.
(v)    Contract notes of the transactions are not sent to the respondent no.1
by the appellant inasmuch as the proof of sending viz basically by UPC and
a few courier receipts, lack credibility.
FAO 222/2013                                                               Page 4 of 9

6.             Some of the relevant observations of the arbitrator are
contained in paras 7 to 9 of the Award and these paras read as under:-
       “7.     The representatives of the respondent has strenuously argued that the
       applicant and her husband had been visiting the Varanasi branch of the
       respondent and were in constant touch with the officials of the respondent
       branch. It is stated that all the trades and transactions executed in the
       account of the applicant have been carried out by the applicant herself. The
       copies of the contract notes have also been submitted. Examination of few
       contract notes would show that there were heavy transactions with the
       interval of few minutes almost through the day. For example the contract
       note dated 20.7.2005 shows that the first order for trade was allegedly
       placed by the applicant at 9:50:11 and the last order was placed at 15:29:44
       and with the interval of few seconds and minutes as many as 46
       transactions were carried out. Further, the contract note relating to the
       trades executed on 24.6.2008 shows that the first five orders for the trades
       were placed at 9:56:43 and the last order for trade was at 15:29:32. In
       between these trades these were as many as 181 Transactions were carried
       out with intervals of few seconds and few minutes throughout the trading
       time. The contract notes for 25.9.2008 shows that the first two orders were
       placed at10:56:43 and the last order was at 12:35:11 and in between there
       were nine other trades with intervals of few minutes and few seconds
       executed. The contract note dated 30.9.2008 shows that first order for
       trades was placed at 10:50:52 and the last order was at 15:48:53. In
       between trades numbering 15 were executed. The contract note for
       25.7.2008 shows that the first order for trade was allegedly placed at
       9:55:37 and the order for five last trades was placed at 15:26:P21. In
       between 93 transactions were carried out with intervals of few seconds and
       few minutes throughout the trading day. The contract note for 18.7.2008
       shows that the first order for trade was allegedly placed at 9:55:37 and the
       order for five last trades was laced at 15:26:P21. In between 93
       transactions were carried out with intervals of few seconds and few minutes
       throughout the trading day. The contract note for 18.7.2008. Shows that
       first order for first transaction was placed at 9:56:51 and the last order for
       trade was placed at 15:11:46. In between as many as 200 trades were
       executed with the interval of few seconds and few minutes throughout the
       trading day. Again, the contract note dated 17.7.2008. Shows the first order
       for transaction took place at 9:56:51 and the last order was at 15:22:10 and
       in between with the intervals of few seconds and few minutes 64 trades
       were carried out. The contract note dated 28.8.2008 shows that the order
FAO 222/2013                                                                      Page 5 of 9

       for first trade was received at 13:23:30 and the last order was placed at
       15:51:44. In between these two orders as many as 34 trades were carried
       out with the intervals of few seconds and few minutes and the contract note
       dated 17.2.2008 shows that the order for first trade was received at 9:56:51
       and the order for last trade was at 14:23:49 and in between ten trades were
       executed with intervals of few minutes and few seconds.
       8.      From the above contract notes the necessary inference is that if the
       trades mentioned about contract notes were executed by the applicant she
       must be an on lines trades mentioned about contract notes were executed by
       the applicant she must be an on line trade which she is admittedly not or
       she was sitting in the branch office of the respondent at Varanasi
       throughout the trading hours and was giving instructions to the officials of
       the respondent branch. If this contention is believed the respondent would
       have produced the visitor’s register of the branch to show the entry and
       departure of the applicant or even of her husband in the branch office of the
       respondent. This has not been produced. Any other document showing
       that that the applicant or even her husband had come to the office of the
       respondent for carrying out these heavy and large number of transactions,
       noted above, has been filed by the respondent. If the respondent was in
       touch or in contract with the officials of the branch office of the respondent
       for carrying out transactions, mentioned in the contract note, it would mean
       that she had been constantly on telephone line and talking to the officials of
       the respondent taking information and placing order for the trades second
       by second and minute by minute. It is impossible to execute such large
       number of transaction on telephone.              Even otherwise telephonic
       conversation or any record of telephone incoming and outgoing calls of the
       respondent made or received from the applicant has not been filed by the
       respondent. It is also pertinent to note that the trading account was initially
       opened by the applicant at Lucknow branch of the respondent. No trade
       note of any trade similar to the trades, which have been executed at
       Varanasi branch, have been produced by the respondent the necessary
       inference is that these large number of transactions have been carried out by
       the officials of the respondent with instructions and consent of the
       applicant.
       9.      The respondent was obliged to send contract notes of the
       transactions carried out in the trading account of the applicant and the
       Photostat copies of the certificates of posting of future contract notes
       allegedly sent on 1.7.2008, 2.7.2008, 5.7.2008, 3.7.2008, 3.7.2008,
       18.7.2008, 21.7.2008, 26.7.2008, 27th or 29.7.2008, 30.7.2008 and
       31.7.2008 have been filed. The applicant has denied to have received any
       such contract notes. The onus was upon the applicant to prove that the
FAO 222/2013                                                                       Page 6 of 9

       contract notes were delivered to the applicant. The contract notes were not
       sent by registered post so the proof of delivery thereof is obtained. In this
       case there is no allegation that the digital contract notes were sent. I here
       for, I do not find the evidence produced by the respondent about delivery of
       the contract notes to be reliable. This reinforces the contention of the
       applicant that she had no information about the transactions and the trades
       were executed in her account without her authority and consent.”
                                                         (underlining added)
7.             The court below has dismissed the objections by observing that
arbitrator has arrived at findings of facts on the basis of record/evidence, and
courts under Section 34 do not sit as an appellate court to reppraise the
findings of facts and conclusions of the arbitrator, once the conclusions are
reasonable conclusions which any reasonable person can arrive at.
8.             To satisfy my judicial conscience I have gone through the
arbitration record. It could not be disputed on behalf of the appellant that
there is no proof of any written instructions of orders being placed by the
respondent no.1 upon the appellant and also there is no proof filed before the
arbitrator of any telephonic instructions given to the appellant by the
respondent no.1. Also, there is no dispute that respondent no.1 never visited
the Varanasi Branch office of the appellant. The only documentary evidence
filed by the appellant pertained to sending of contract notes, and which the
arbitrator in my opinion has rightly held to lack credibility because this
FAO 222/2013                                                                      Page 7 of 9

documentary proof consists only of UPC document, and not of sending by
registered AD post. Also, about 3 odd courier receipts have been filed
however, a reference to the same also show that they lack credibility because
there are no signatures of the respondent no.1 on these receipts to show that
she ever received any document as per the courier receipts.
9.           No doubt, there was a disputed question of fact as to whether or
not respondent no.1 had given any authorisation dated 6.6.2008, but this
document the arbitrator within his jurisdiction has held not to be a genuine
document I would not want to entertain any quarrel about this aspect
because arbitrator is the final authority with respect to appreciation of
evidence, and if two views are possible, no court hearing objections under
Section 34, much less an appellate court hearing an appeal against the
judgment dismissing objections, would want to reappraise the finding of
fact. In any case, it appears to be very doubtful as to why any customer will
give a totally ‘blank cheque’ so as to say by a limitless authorization at
6.6.2008 for any and every trading at any and every rate and any and every
date from the shares in the De-Mat account of the respondent no.1. It is
inconceivable why such an unlimited power could ever have been given by
the respondent no.1 who is not in any manner related to the appellant or any
FAO 222/2013                                                               Page 8 of 9

of its directors etc, and the respondent no.1 is only a normal customer of the
appellant. Therefore, for this additional reason I agree with the conclusions
of the arbitrator that so called authorization dated 6.6.2008 allegedly signed
by the appellant is a fabricated document.
10.           In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the appeal, and
the same is therefore dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
