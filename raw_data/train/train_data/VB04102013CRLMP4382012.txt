1.     The case of the appellant/complainant is that the respondent/accused
had approached the appellant/complainant for a short term loan of amount of
`15 lakhs in February, 2009. The aforesaid loan amount was granted by
issuing a demand draft No.962053 dated 25.3.2009 in favour of the
respondent. The respondent had agreed to repay the said amount along with
CRL.L.P. No.438/2012                                    Page 1 of 6

interest and as such had issued a cheque No.344365 dated 2.9.2010 for an
amount of `20,40,000/- with the assurance that the said cheque would be
encashed on its presentation. However, on presentation, the said cheque was
dishonoured        and   returned  to   the  appellant/complainant   company.
Thereafter, complainant company issued a legal notice and called upon
respondent/accused to pay the amount against the dishonoured cheque.
However, the respondent did not reply to the said notice nor made the
payment.        Ultimately, appellant/complainant company had filed the
aforesaid criminal complaint against the respondent/accused under Section
138 and 142 of Negotiable Instruments Act through its authorized
representative. The learned MM vide order dated 29.10.2010 had issued
summons         to    the    respondent/accused   for    appearance.     The
respondent/accused had appeared on 6.1.2011 and on furnishing the surety
the learned MM granted bail to the respondent and the case was adjourned to
18.2.2011 for settlement of proceedings/framing of notice/statement of
defence. It is alleged that the appellant/complainant company have been
regularly appearing before the learned MM. On 7.5.2011, the authorized
representative appeared before the learned MM but the learned Judge was on
leave and the matter was adjourned to 7.7.2011. Even on the said date, the
learned MM was on leave and the matter was heard by the link MM and the
case was adjourned for 29.10.2011 for framing of notice. It is stated that on
29.10.2011 also the learned Presiding Officer was on leave and the matter
was heard by the link MM. The counsel for respondent/accused had made
the statement before the learned MM that they are exploring the possibility
of amicable settlement and the matter was adjourned to 6.1.2012. It is stated
on behalf of the appellant/company that its authorized representative used to
CRL.L.P. No.438/2012                                  Page 2 of 6

appear before the ld.M.M. However, the said representative had left the
appellant/company to join some other company at Rajasthan. On inquiry
being made from the said representative, it was revealed that the case had
been adjourned to 4.5.2012 for amicable settlement. On the aforesaid date
when the other authorized representative of the appellant/company appeared,
the matter was not there in the cause list and on inquiry it was revealed that
the case was already dismissed for non-appearance on 6.1.2012.            The
appellant/complainant company vide its letter dated 16.5.2012 expressed its
anguish over the negligence of the previous representative. It is stated that
thereafter the appellant/company challenged the order dated 6.1.2012 by
filing a revision petition before the learned ASJ, Delhi. However, the same
was dismissed as withdrawn on 5.6.2012 as the revision was not
maintainable. It is stated that again an appeal was filed before the learned
ASJ and the same was also dismissed as withdrawn on 20.7.2011 with
liberty to file the same before the appropriate forum. Thereafter, a new
counsel was engaged and after taking proper advice the present appeal was
filed on 13.8.2012. It is stated that the non-appearance was due to the
reasons stated above and the delay has also occurred due to approaching the
wrong forum i.e. first by filing revision petition before the learned ASJ and
thereafter challenging the impugned order before the learned ASJ by filing
an appeal.
2.     It is submitted that the complaint was dismissed for non-appearance
on 6.1.2012 due to the bona fide mistake on the part of the
appellant/company as its authorized representative who had left the services
of the respondent/company had wrongly given the next date of hearing as
4.5.2012 and thereafter due to wrong advice the appellant/company
CRL.L.P. No.438/2012                                 Page 3 of 6

approached the wrong forum and after the proper advice the appeal has been
filed before this court on 13.8.2012. It is prayed that the impugned order be
set aside and the complaint be restored to its original number and position.
3.     The learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused has
submitted that the complainant has been negligent in appearance before the
court on number of dates and as such the learned MM was fully justified in
dismissing the complaint for non-appearance of appellant/complainant and
acquitting the respondent.
4.     Section 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that if upon
the day appointed for the appearance of the accused or any day subsequent
thereto to which the hearing may be adjourned, the complainant does not
appear, the Magistrate shall, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore
contained, acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks proper to
adjourn the hearing of the case to some other day.
5.     The learned counsel for appellant has taken through the order sheet of
the case which has been annexed with this petition. The order sheet shows
that the complaint was filed on 18.10.2010. The summoning order was
passed on 29.10.2011. On 6.1.2011, the respondent/accused appeared and
furnished bail bond and matter was adjourned to 18.2.2011. On the said
date, parties submitted that no settlement has been made and the matter was
adjourned to 7.5.2011. On 7.5.2011, the appellant/complainant was present.
However, the Presiding Officer was on leave and the matter was taken up by
link MM and was adjourned to 7.7.2011. Thereafter, it has been adjourned
to 29.10.2011. Even on the said date, the learned MM was on leave and the
link MM had taken up the matter and it was stated by the parties that they
were exploring the possibility of settlement and the matter was adjourned to
CRL.L.P. No.438/2012                                  Page 4 of 6

6.1.2012.      On the said date, there is no appearance on behalf of the
complainant/company and the complaint was dismissed for non-appearance
and    the    respondent/accused    was    acquitted.     The     stand of the
appellant/complainant is that the authorized representative of the
appellant/company who was representing him in the present case had left the
appellant/company and joined some other company at Rajasthan and
informed the next date as 4.5.2012. It is stated that due to that reason, there
is no appearance on behalf of the appellant/company on 6.1.2012.
Thereafter, the delay has been explained by the appellant/company as it is
stated that first a revision petition was filed before the learned ASJ on
25.5.2012 which was dismissed as withdrawn as the proper remedy was to
challenge the impugned order by filing the appeal. The relevant order is
placed on record.
6.     Thereafter, it is stated that the appeal was filed before the ld.ASJ,
Delhi which was also dismissed as withdrawn.             The relevant order is
reproduced as under:-
               “Crl. Appeal No.32/12
               20/7/2012
               Present:     Sh Manish Kumar, Advocate for the
                            appellant.
                            There is only one respondent.
                     Notice of the appeal has not been issued as
               yet to the respondent. Ld. Counsel for the
               appellant submits that he be allowed to withdraw
               this appeal with liberty to file the same before
               appropriate forum.
                     In view of his statement, the appeal is
               dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the
               appellant to file the same before appropriate
               forum.
CRL.L.P. No.438/2012                                  Page 5 of 6

                     File be consigned to the record room.
                     Copy of the proceedings be given to ld.
                     Counsel for the appellant (free of cost) as
                     prayed for.”
7.      In view of above reasoning, no negligence is seen on the part of the
appellant/company. It cannot be said that the absence was intentional but it
was on account of the fact of leaving of the job by its representative and
giving wrong date to the appellant. The delay has also been explained in a
proper manner as earlier the appellant had approached the wrong forum
twice as has been discussed above.
8.      In the facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the
appellant has intentionally allowed the complaint to be dismissed in default
as the same will have the effect of losing its valuable right of proceedings in
a complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act wherein a
cheque of `20 lakhs has been dishonoured.
9.      In view of above discussion, the        delay in filing the appeal is
condoned and the impugned order is set aside and the complaint is restored
to its original number and position, subject to payment of cost of `7,500/- to
be deposited with Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee within two
weeks.     The parties shall appear before the concerned learned MM on
11.11.2013.
        The appeal as well as application for condonation of delay stand
disposed of accordingly.
