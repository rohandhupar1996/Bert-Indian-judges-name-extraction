      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PRADEEP NANDRAJOG
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V. KAMESWAR RAO
PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
1.    On September 29, 2010, W.P.(C) No.18387/2004 and W.P.(C)
No.18395/2004 were disposed of setting aside a common order dated April
   W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                            Page 1 of 16

06, 2004 disposing of OA No.452/2002 and OA No.453/2002 filed by
S.C.Gupta and others as also Upender Agnidev and others, respectively.
The matter was remanded to the Tribunal for fresh adjudication.
2.     At a common enquiry against many officers in the Engineering
Department in the Irrigation and Flood Department under the Government
of NCT Delhi in which one set of witnesses were examined, but separate
reports submitted by the enquiry officer; the reports being pari material in
substance, all officers were indicted and after obtaining the advice from the
Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) but not communicating the advice to
them various penalties ranging from reduction of pay to compulsory
retirement and cut in pension were inflicted.
3.     The indictment was for the reason a bridge constructed in village
Ronahla by the Irrigation and Flood Department of the Government of NCT
Delhi collapsed within a week of it being opened for traffic. The charged
officers were associated in the construction of the bridge as Superintending
Engineer, Executive Engineer, Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
respectively.
4.     The charged officers had taken a defence that the bridge had
collapsed, not on account of any lapse committed by them, but for the reason
there was an inherent design defect in the bridge.
5.     Before the enquiry officer the charged officers filed an application to
bring on record relevant documents which according to them would have
proved the defence. They had an issue of all documents not being supplied
as also the ones which were supplied were very late and in piecemeal during
the ongoing inquiry.
6.     The inquiry officer indicted the charged officers, and as noted above,
   W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                          Page 2 of 16

different penalties were imposed on them.
7.     The indicted officers had urged various points in response to the
report of the inquiry officer and having a grievance that the points were not
considered by the Disciplinary Authority which levied the penalty, they
urged said points before the Appellate Authority but met with no success.
8.     Challenging the penalty levied, before the Central Administrative
Tribunal various pleas were urged and the same can be broadly put under
four heads.
9.     Of the four pleas, two were technical and two pertained to the
substance of the inquiry held against them.
10.    The two technical pleas urged were, firstly that the advice received
from CVC pertaining to the penalty to be levied was not disclosed to them.
Thus, it was urged that the order levying penalty required to be set aside and
the Disciplinary Authority be directed to supply the advice of the CVC to
enable them to respond. Second technical plea urged was that the mandate
of Sub-Rule 18 of Rule 14 of CCS (CCA) Rules 1965 was violated. It was
urged that from the evidence the circumstances appearing against them were
not put to them by the inquiry officer and hence the inquiry was vitiated.
11.    Pertaining to the earlier round of litigation fought between the
department and the sets of officers above noted, it was noted that two pleas
of substance urged were as pleaded in para 4.12 and 4.16 and the
corresponding grounds urged in para 5.1 (with the sub para(s)) of the
grounds urged as also Ground 5.4 and 5.5 of the Original Application filed
by Shri S.C.Gupta, the respondent No.1 in WP(C) No.18387/2004. The
same were noted as under:-
   W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                          Page 3 of 16

   “4.12         The inquiry proceedings were thereafter fixed for
   16.3.1998. On the said date, the applicant submitted a list of 34
   documents, all of which were permitted by the Inquiry Officer. A
   copy of the order dated 16.3.1998 is annexed hereto as
   ANNEXURE A-10. The Presenting Officer was further directed
   that in case of those documents not being available for one
   reason or the other, a certificate for non-availability should be
   obtained and filed. The applicant further states that the
   Presenting Officer took a considerably long time in making
   available the additional defence documents, which made it
   impossible for the applicant to prepare his defence vis-à-vis the
   said documents; whereas some documents were not at all made
   available for inspection. The applicant annexes hereto as
   ANNEXURE A-11. A copy of the statement in a tabulated form
   showing the dates and documents in which the inspection was
   allowed. The statement annexed also details the documents the
   inspection of which was not at all given to the applicant, not
   withstanding that all these documents were adjudged to be
   relevant by the Inquiry Officer vide his order dated 16.3.98 and
   thus, allowed to be permitted. It is respectfully stated that the
   contents of the annexed statement may be read as the part of the
   pleadings.
                          xxx    xxx   xxx    xxx
   4.16          The reply of the applicant to the comments to the
   Inquiry was submitted on 13.5.99. Copy thereof is annexed as
   ANNEXURE A-17.             The disciplinary authority, however,
   without considering the points of defence of the applicant in his
   reply to the report of the inquiry officer and during the course of
   personal hearing, imposed on the applicant the penalty of
   compulsory retirement vide order dated 11.1.2000 of which a
   copy is already annexed hereto as ANNEXURE A-1.
                          xxx    xxx   xxx    xxx

   5.1 Because the applicant had submitted a detailed list of
   additional documents required for and on behalf of defence
   during the inquiry proceedings to substantiate his defence. Vide
   order dated 16.3.1998, the Inquiry Officer allowed the list of
   additional documents demanded by the applicant and directed
   the prosecution to make available all documents in the list dated
   16.3.1998 on or before 27.3.1998 or to obtain and produce on
   record a “non-availability certificate” in respect of documents
   not made available to the defence. However, the prosecution
   supplied only some documents to the applicant and some
   documents which were crucial for the applicant to prove his
   defence were not made available to him at all. The list of
   documents not supplied to the applicant is detailed in the
   paragraphs to follow. It is also pertinent to mention here that
   some of the vital documents had been made available to the
   applicant at night of 1.4.1998, 3.4.1998, 6.4.1998 and 7.4.1998
   though the regular hearing had started on 1.4.98, and completed
   on 8.4.1998. As such the applicant was not given reasonable
   and sufficient time to prepare his defence in an effective manner
   which has resulted in causing serious prejudice to the applicant.
          The documents demanded by the applicant and allowed by
   the Inquiry Officer but not made available to him and which has
   caused material prejudice to the applicant are as under:-
   (i)    Work files maintained at Circle Level in the office of
   Superintending Engineer Shri R.M.Puttaswamy and at the Sub
   Divisional level in respect of the work in question.
          The prosecution had made available the applicant only the
   work files maintained at Divisional Level while those maintained
   at Circle Level and Sub-Divisional Level were neither supplied
   nor shown for inspection to the applicant. It is pertinent to
   mention here that the Sub-Divisional Officer i.e. Assistant
   Engineer had maintai8ned a correspondence file at his end
   during the time of construction of the bridge. Had the said file
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                         Page 5 of 16

   been produced, it would have been proved through
   correspondence between the Assistant Engineer and his superior
   officers that the applicant was performing his part as per
   instructions of his seniors in a transparent manner and with
   integrity, sincerity and devotion to duty. In the absence of the
   said documents, the applicant could not effectively cross
   examine certain witnesses particularly Shri G.S.Arora and Shri
   A.N.Gupa in order to show that the applicant had been acting
   under the dictation and control of Shri G.S.Arora and had
   performed his duty in an honest and a fair manner.
   (ii) Agreement number EE/SDDV/2/90-91 entered into with
   the contractor for construction of work in question.
          The said document was essential for effectively cross-
   examining Shri A.N.Gupta (PW-4) and Shri G.S.Arora (PW-5)
   who had held the post of Engineer In Charge.
          Had the said record been produced, the applicant would
   have shown (through clause 6 of the General Conditions of
   Contract) that it was the Engineer-In-Charge i.e. the Executive
   Engineer (PW-5) who had to ascertain and determine the value
   in accordance with the contract of work done and the applicant
   was working only as an authorized representative of Engineer-
   In-Charge and was bound by his instructions and orders and the
   applicant diligently performed his legitimate sphere of duties
   and responsibilities attached to various posts manning the
   execution of work at bridge. The aforementioned agreement was
   thus essential for defence of the applicant.
   (iii) Complete file maintained at SSW office in the year 1993-
   94, in respect of Ranhola Bridge containing letter number
   CEF/SSW/Ranhola Bridge/93-94 (PF) 3308 dated 6.12.1994 and
   documents disclosing action taken by the addressee and
   endorsee authority who had specifically directed to take suitable
   action.
          Only letter dated 6.12.1994 (marked as Ex.D-3C) was
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                        Page 6 of 16

   made available to the applicant instead of the complete file that
   was asked for. Through this document the applicant would have
   proved the fact of failure of design of structure submitted by the
   private designer which was not in conformity with the Indian
   Road Congress Codes and Indian Standard Guidelines. This
   document would have further proved that the applicant had
   nothing to do with the poor compaction of the concrete and it
   would have nullified the adverse effect of the Reports Ex.S-2, S-3
   and S-4.
   (iv) Duties and Responsibilities attached to the post of Junior
   Engineer, Assistant Engineer, Executive Engineer and
   Superintending Engineer while performing duties infield.
          Though these documents, the applicant would have been
   able to prove that he was not empowered to act beyond a scope
   of instructions and orders given by Shri G.S.Arora at the time of
   execution of work. The applicant would have proved the scope
   of his duties vis-à-vis duties of his superiors.
   (v) Letters number PA/JS/(IF)/623 dated 25.7.95 issued by
   Development Commissioner/Secretary (I&F) to Director
   General (Road Development Ministry of Surface Transport),
   along with letter number RW/NH/34066/2/95-S&R dated 16.8.95
   issued by Superintending Engineer (Bridges) for Director
   General, Road Development, in response to the above said letter
   along with the document disclosing action on the same.
          The main document disclosing action taken on the letter
   dated 16.8.95 by which the Department was intimated regarding
   the vital defect in design had been concealed. This document
   would have proved that there had been no defect in the execution
   of the work as the3 basic design itself was faulty. The said
   document would have proved that whenever a structure fails to
   meet the requirements of design aspect and when it is under
   reinforced, it is liable to fall, irrespective of the quality of
   concrete.
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                         Page 7 of 16

   (vi) Reply by CWC in response to letter number PA/JS/I &
   F/214 dated 5.9.94 by Secretary (I&F) to Chairman, Central
   Water Commission.
          The said letter was addressed in order to identify the
   defects in design and drawings and to confirm whether the
   existing design was sufficient to withstand the Indian Road
   Congress.
          The said reply had clearly admitted that the design
   submitted by the designer of the bridge in question was not
   sufficient to bear 70R loading and was liable to fall and fall
   when subjected to actual designed load.
          In the absence of the said document, the applicant was
   deprived of opportunity to effectively cross examine witness
   Sh.B.K.Mittal (PW-2) who was closely and squarely related to
   checking of the design of the Bridge.
   (vii) Minutes of the Meeting held on 3.2.1995.
          This document would have proved on record that CWC
   had clearly stated that collapse was due to failure of design and
   wrong placement and over-crowded reinforcement and thin
   section as shown in drawing. It was recorded in the said
   minutes that it was under reinforced structure which had fallen
   after giving proper warnings like appearance of cracks and
   showing sagging. Negligence of Sh.O.P.Sharma, Chief Engineer
   would have been proved on record through this document who
   allowed the bridge to collapse and did not take any remedial
   measures as suggested by Shri K.B.Rajoria PW-8 vide Ex.S-4.
          It is pertinent to mention here that witness Shri
   O.P.Sharma was not produced as a witness even though he was
   a cited witness.
   (viii) Documents disclosing the base, date, documents on the
   basis of which Ex.S-5 had been framed.
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                         Page 8 of 16

   Non supply of the said documents deprived the applicant the
   opportunity of cross examining PW-2 effectively, the author and
   framer of Ex.S-2 thereby causing serious prejudice to the
   applicant.
   (ix) The documents, data, drawings etc. on the basis of which
   document listed at S.No.4 of the impugned charge-sheet had
   been framed including the details of type of equipment used
   while conducting the said inspection and the codes relied upon
   while framing the said report.
   These documents would have proved the fact that the defects and
   deficiency in design pointed out by Shri Rajoria, (PW-8) had
   been concealed by the prosecution.
   (x) The applicant had demanded the details of the
   methodology adopted in collecting and testing the core samples
   and chipping concrete samples and disclosure of their respective
   standardized codes on basing which such methods had been
   adopted as stated in para 1 on page 1 in conclusions and listed
   document number 3 along with structure proof to the effect that
   such instructions had been followed.
   In response to the above mentioned documents, Dr.Maiti (PW-
   1), the author and framer of Ex.S-3 made a malafide attempt to
   cover the gap apparent on the face of the said Ex.S-3 and
   forwarded some loose papers which nowhere disclose any proof
   to the effect whether the instructions/orders etc. contained in the
   code had ever been followed at the time of collecting and testing
   the samples. Moreover, no document was produced either by
   Dr.Maiti or prosecution to prove whether any such tests had
   been carried out and in whose presence, on what date and time
   and at what place.
   (xi) Literature of machines appearing in Fig.1 at page of listed
   document No.3 and the maintenance register proving the fact of
   maintenance of said machines as per norms and standards as
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                          Page 9 of 16

    suggested by Manufacturers to give due performance and proof
    of specific training imparted to the as core cutting is a
    specialized job and requires skilled workers and good machines.
    Dr.Maiti PW-1 provided illegible photocopies of the documents.
    No material was placed on records to show whether the said
    machine purportedly used at the time of collecting samples had
    been done as per inherent requirement of the code.
    This strengthened the defence plea that Dr.Maiti was having a
    concept of maintenance of machines/equipments purportedly
    used in collecting samples.
    (xii) Documents proving the fact that due care and caution had
    been taken by NCB as stated in 2nd para at page 2 of the Report
    of the document listed at Sr.No.3.
           The said document was very essential for effective cross
    examination of PW-1, Dr.Maiti.
    (xiii) Documents, codes etc. disclosing and explaining the
    variables which are standardized and some of which are non-
    standardized.
           Absence of these documents affected the cross
    examination of Dr.Maiti, PW-1. It is pertinent to mention here
    that the applicant had demanded documents explaining
    „variables‟ as appearing in para 2 of page 2 of the Report (part
    of Ex.S-3) whereas Dr.Maiti, PW-1 vide para 5 at page 2 of
    Ex.D-19, submitted the clarifications regarding variation in
    percentage of cement contents which had no relevance with the
    contents of the reports against which the document had been
    demanded.
    (xiv) Documents disclosing variation allowed in the result of
    chemical analysis and the method of testing and deducing the
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                       Page 10 of 16

    compressive strength and variation allowed in the result
    including the disclosure of the equipment used to test the
    samples with that respective manufacturer literature.
    These documents would have shown that testing was not done as
    per laid down norms and standards prescribed for the purpose.
    (xv) Log books of vehicles number DLV-3, DED-3784, DNA-
    1935, DDV-403, DAE-30, for a period of January 91 to
    September 93.
           These documents had been demanded to establish the fact
    that all superiors of the applicant like Engineer In Charge,
    Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer had also visited the
    site and issued necessary instructions regarding execution of
    work, especially concrete work, the quality of which has been
    alleged to be poor.
    (xvi) Complete Court File and Arbitration File in respect of the
    appointment of the Arbitrator and claim counter claim of the
    department in case number 736/98 in suit number 2559-A/94.
           These documents were important for the defence of the
    applicant to bring on record the fact that the department had
    taken an entirely different stance before the Hon‟ble High Court
    of Delhi and nowhere laid the blame at the door of the Execution
    Staff.
           It is pertinent to mention here that the department has
    admitted before the Hon‟ble High Court that there had been
    poor workmanship on part of the contractor and the department
    had accepted the work with due deductions in the same. It is
    specifically mentioned that the lapses that are appearing of
    workmanship are those which have been admitted by Engineer
    Incharge. The contractor had challenged the department vide
    Ex.D-10 stating that the design of the structure was faulty and
    not safe. Further Ex.D-3(c) and Ex.D-7 are the documents by
W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                        Page 11 of 16

       which the department admitted that structure had collapsed due
       to design failure.
       (xvii) Notification issued by the Competent Authority i.e. L.G.
       approving the adoption of CPWD Manual in Irrigation and
       Flood Department.
              The said notification was essential and was required to
       show that CPWD Manual/CPWD Code were not applicable at
       the material time and any reliance thereupon by the prosecution
       has no force and cannot advance the case of prosecution any
       further.
              The non supply of above mentioned crucial documents
       deprived the applicant at a fair opportunity to defend himself
       against the cooked up charges.”
12.    It was noted that the impugned judgment and order dated April 06,
2004 passed by the Tribunal had dealt with only two pleas i.e. the two
technical pleas and has not dealt with the pleas of substance.
13.    It was noted that the respondents in the two writ petitions would be
entitled to an adjudication on the pleas urged by them and the grounds urged
in support thereof. Indeed, it did require to be considered whether the
inquiry officer erred in not ensuring the documents production whereof was
sought after holding that they were relevant and the effect thereof. If the
charged officers could show that the bridge collapsed due to a faulty design
and in respect of the evidence sought to be brought on record that they
permitted sub-standard material to be used, could establish that Ground 5.4
urged was correct, they would have successfully demonstrated that the
charge of permitting sub-standard material to be used was sustained ignoring
  W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                         Page 12 of 16

the said pleas and deficiency in the evidence brought on record.
14.    It was noted that the Tribunal has remanded the matter with a
direction that the inquiry officer should examine the respondents as per the
mandate of Rule 14(18) of the CCS(CCA) Rules and additionally that the
Disciplinary Authority should supply the CVC advice rendered to the
department pertaining to the penalty to be levied.
15.    Now, if the charged officers can make good the contentions urged by
them in para 4.12 and para 4.16 and the Grounds urged in para 5.1, 5.4 and
5.5 of the Grounds, that would mean that the entire inquiry report stands
vitiated and it would be a case of denial of fair opportunity of defence as
also a case of the inquiry officer ignoring material evidence.
16.    Pertaining to the two issues decided by the Tribunal, it was opined
that the Tribunal has not adjudicated whether non-compliance with the Rule
has prejudiced the defence and especially when we look to the pleadings in
para 4.12 and para 4.16 and the relatable Grounds urged in para 5.1, 5.4 and
5.5 and as noted above. It was noted that in the decision reported as 1980(3)
SCC 304 Sunil Kumar Banerjee vs. State of West Bengal & Ors, non-
adherence to Rule 8(19) of the All India Service Disciplinary Rules 1969,
which is pari material with Rule 14(18) of the CCS(CCA) Rules 1965 was
held to be non-fatal except upon prejudice caused being shown.               A
somewhat discordant note has been struck by the Supreme Court in the
decisions reported as 2008 (3) SCC 484 Moni Shankar vs. UOI & Anr. and
1998 (3) SCC 227 Ministry of Finance & Anr. vs. S.B.Ramesh.
17.    On the issue of CVC advice not being disclosed to the charged
officers, the Tribunal had noted the decision of the Supreme Court reported
as JT 1992 (6) SC 673 State Bank of India vs. D.C.Aggarwal, but has not
  W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                          Page 13 of 16

factored the fact that the advice by CVC was to dismiss the charged officers
from service but the Disciplinary Authority has levied a penalty less than
what was advised by the CVC and in this context has not considered
whether any prejudice was caused.
18.    Accordingly, vide decision dated September 29, 2010 the impugned
order dated April 06, 2004 was set aside and OA No.452/2002 and OA
No.453/2002 were remanded to the Tribunal for fresh adjudication with a
direction that all contentions urged and pleas raised in the Original
Applications shall be decided by the Tribunal including on the two issues on
which we find truncated decision by the Tribunal.
19.    We are now concerned with the same issue for the second time
pertaining to S.C.Gupta and Upender Agnidev and one more person
Sh.J.M.Sharma.
20.    Without deciding the issues which the Tribunal was called upon to do,
deciding the Original Applications filed by Upender Agnidev and S.C.Gupta
vide impugned order dated July 04, 2011 challenge in W.P.(C)
No.1054/2012 and W.P.(C) No.1228/2012 the Tribunal has short cut the
matter by holding that the bridge collapsed due to faulty design and for
which the Tribunal has heavily relied upon the fact that in an arbitration
dispute between the contractor who constructed the bridge and the
department, the award was in favour of the contractor who successfully
established that the bridge collapsed due to a faulty design. Accordingly,
the Tribunal has held that the said two officers i.e. S.C.Gupta and Upender
Agnidev could not be indicted. Vide separate order dated February 21,
2012, following the decision dated July 04, 2011, relief has been granted to
J.M.Sharma.
  W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                         Page 14 of 16

21.    Regretfully, the matter has to be remanded back to the Tribunal once
again. The reason is that, the design of the bridge was approved by the
Superintending Engineer Sh.R.C.Sood, in spite of deficiencies pointed out in
the drawing by the consultant and at the inquiry evidence was led of said
fact. Sh.R.C.Sood has been visited with a penalty, and we are not concerned
with the same.
22.    As regards the other charged officers, the report of the inquiry officer
has taken into account evidenced of sub-standard material being used. This
evidence could not have been ignored by the Tribunal. Indeed, at the earlier
round of litigation when the matter was remanded to the Tribunal, said
aspect was highlighted by the Division Bench requiring the Tribunal to take
into account said evidence but at the same time keep in mind the contentions
urged by the charged officers.
23.    As regards the arbitral award, it is not unknown to see Government
briefs being lost due to inapt handling by lowly paid counsel who are pitted
against the might of contractors who have the benefit of the best counsel.
Further, as in the instant case, it would be in the interest of the officers
themselves to see and ensure that the award is against the department for
then the evidence pertaining to the defective material used by the contractor
would be buried and the view taken would be that it was a design fault. This
would be used by the officers as a shield in domestic proceedings.
24.    Noting that the Tribunal has once again done a clumsy job and
regretfully has not instructed itself with the issues highlighted by a Division
Bench of this Court in the decision dated September 29, 2010, we dispose of
the writ petitions quashing the impugned orders dated July 04, 2011 and
February 21, 2012.          OA No.70/2006, OA No.452/2002 and OA
  W.P.(C) Nos.1054/12, 1228/12 & 5792/12                            Page 15 of 16

No.453/2002 are restored for fresh adjudication by the Tribunal with a
direction that all issues required to be decided keeping in view the decision
dated September 29, 2010 passed by this Court would be decided.
25.    Parties shall appear before the Registrar of the Tribunal on May 20,
2013 who shall list the original applications before the concerned Bench for
fresh adjudication.
26.    No costs.
27.    DASTI.
