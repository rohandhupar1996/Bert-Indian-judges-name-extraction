                               JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
                   This is an appeal under Section 374 Cr.PC against the judgment
     and order dated 04.02.2009, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Cachar,
     in Sessions Case No. 100/2005 under Sections 448/427/323/324/307/34
     IPC, convicting and sentencing the accused/appellant Uttam Gowala under
     Section 427 of the IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for 3 (three)
     months. Both the accused/appellants are convicted and sentenced under
        Crl. A. No. 47 of 2009                                                    Page 1 of 7

Section 448 of the IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for 3 (three)
months, under Sections 323/34 of the IPC to undergo Rigorous
Imprisonment for 1 (one) year, under Sections 324/34 IPC to undergo
Rigorous Imprisonment for 1 (one) year, and a fine of Rs. 2,000/-, under
Sections 326/34 IPC and Rigorous Imprisonment for 3 (three) years and
Rigorous Imprisonment for 4 (four) years with a fine of Rs. 5,000/- under
Sections 307/34 IPC.
2.             Heard Mr. SC Biswas, learned counsel for the accused/appellants.
Also heard Ms. S Jahan, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for
the State of Assam.
3.             The prosecution case is that the accused/appellants Jitesh Gowala
and Uttam Gowala alongwith two others, armed with iron rods, Bhujali etc
entered into the tea stall of the informant and caused mischief to the
property of the tea stall, assaulted Gopal Choudhury @ Abul Choudhury
and brother of the informant Kajal Choudhury by means of sharp weapon
causing grievous injuries to their persons.
4.             On the above facts, Kajal Choudhury, lodged the FIR with the
Police. The Police registered a case, investigated into it, collected evidence,
arrested the accused/appellants, forwarded them to judicial custody,
collected medical report of examination of the injured, and finally,
submitted charge-sheet against the accused/appellants under Sections
448/427/323/324/326/307/34 of the IPC.
5.             The learned Sessions Judge tried the case on receipt of the same
on being committed by the learned Magistrate, the case being exclusively
triable by the Court of Session.
6.             The       learned Sessions Judge   framed  charges    against      the
accused/appellants under Sections 448/427/323/324/326/307/34 of the
IPC. The accused/appellants pleaded innocence to the charges.

7.             The prosecution examined as many as 7 (seven) witnesses, who
were subjected to cross-examination by the defense. The defense examined
none. In their statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.PC, the
accused/appellants are found to have denied the accusations levelled
against them, while the incriminating evidence were brought to their
notice.
8.             The learned counsel for the accused/appellants, during the course
of hearing, submitted that there is no ingredient of Section 307 of the IPC
in the instant case. That apart, according to him, the accused/appellants
were not guilty in view of the evidence on record. But the learned Trial
Court convicted them and sentenced them as aforesaid.
9.             Learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for the State of
Assam has referred to the medical examination report available in the case
record, which was exhibited as Ext.2 during the trial. It is submitted that
there is one injury in respect of injured Gopal Choudhury in the little finger
of his right hand causing fracture. There is no other injury as per the said
medical examination report, which attracts the provisions of Section 320
IPC to bring the offence under Section 326 IPC.
10.            The medical examination report, i.e., Ext.2, is reproduced below
for proper appreciation of the evidence relating to the injuries sustained by
the injured persons.
“I examined one Gopal Choudhury, aged 36 years and found the following
injuries:-
1. An excised wound over the left arm about 7 X 3 X 2 c.m. size. Weapon
used-sharp, nature of injury-simple, age of injury-fresh.
    Crl. A. No. 47 of 2009                                           Page 3 of 7

2. An incised wound over the dorsum of right hand with fractured
dislocation of right little finger. Weapon used-sharp, nature of injury-
grievous, age of injury-fresh.
On the same date, I examined Kajal Choudhury, aged about 50 years, and
found the following injuries:-
1. Transverse bruish over the left thigh with tenderness. Type of weapon
    used-blunt, nature of injury-simple, age of injury-fresh.
2. Bruishes over the back of trunk with tenderness. Weapon used-blunt,
    nature of injury-simple, age of injury-fresh.
3. An incised wound over hte left sole measuring 3 X 1 X .5 cm, weapon
    used-sharp, nature of injury-simple, age of injury-fresh.”
11.            From the Ext.2, it appears that the injury sustained by the injured
Kajal Choudhury was simple in nature which was caused by blunt weapon.
In respect of the injured Gopal Choudhury, it is mentioned that the injury
caused on little finger of his right hand was grievous in the sense that there
was fracture and dislocation of the finger and that way this injury attracted
the provisions of Section 326 of the IPC as defined in Section 320 of the
IPC.
12.            There is absolutely no evidence on record led by the prosecution
witnesses, including the doctor, that there was injury in any vital part of the
injured persons.
13.            To attract the offence under Section 307 IPC, intention or
knowledge on the part of the accused that the acts done by them would
have caused death are necessary to be proved by the prosecution. The
injuries sustained by the injured in the instant case are not found to be in
the vital part of their persons, and apparently, such injuries were unlikely to
cause death of the injured persons. Therefore, the provisions of Section 307
    Crl. A. No. 47 of 2009                                            Page 4 of 7

of the IPC is not attracted in the instant case, in view of the evidence on
record.
14.            Although there is denial of causing injury to the injured persons
by the accused/appellants, evidence of the evidence of PW1 and PW5
would reveal that the accused/appellants inflicted injuries on their persons.
15.            The evidence of PW3 makes it clear that the accused/appellant
Uttam Gowala trespassed into the tea stall of the informant Kajal
Choudhury and there took place the incident of assault and that the
accused/appellant Uttam Gowala committed mischief by breaking the
glasses of the tea stall with a lathi. The very specific evidence of PW3 is that
the accused/appellant Jitesh Gowala caused injury to the persons of the
informant/Kajal Choudhury with a sword.
16.            The evidence of PW3 received total corroboration from the
evidence of PW2 so far the fact of trespassing into the tea stall by the
accused/appellants and assaulting the informant/Gopal Choudhury and his
brother Gitesh Choudhury is concerned.
17.            The evidence of PW7 is of routine nature, who, being the
Investigating Police Officer of the case, narrated about the investigation of
the case from receipt of the FIR till filing of the charge-sheet of the case.
18.            The position appearing from the evidence on record being as
above, the learned Sessions Court recorded the order of conviction on the
basis of consistent evidence of PW1, PW3, PW4 and PW5, particularly in
respect of committing trespass by the accused/appellants to the tea stall of
the informant/Kajal Choudhury as well as inflicting injuries upon their
persons.
19.            That being so, the conviction recorded by the learned Sessions
Court needs no interference.
    Crl. A. No. 47 of 2009                                           Page 5 of 7

20.            However, the evidence on record makes it appear that the
accused/appellants Jitesh Gowala inflicted the injuries causing fracture on
the little finger of the right hand of Gopal Choudhury, and therefore, he is
liable to be convicted under Section 326 of the IPC. So, far the offence
under Sections 323/324 of the IPC is concerned, the accused/appellant
Jitesh Gowala, in the considered view of the Court, the provisions of
Section 326 of the IPC covers the same and so far the accused/appellant
Uttam Gowala is concerned, it appears from the evidence on record that he
inflicted injuries upon the informant/Kajal Choudhury with a stick and
thereby the offence committed by him attracts Section 323 of the IPC.
21.            After consideration of the entire evidence on record and the
evaluation and appreciation of the evidence by learned Trial Court, the
evidence as muscled in the judgment, it is found that none of the other
provisions of the IPC under which the accused/appellants are convicted are
attracted in the case except Sections 427/323 of the IPC in respect of the
accused/appellant Uttam Gowala and Section 326 of the IPC against
accsued/appellant Jitesh Gowala .
22.            In view of the above, the sentence imposed upon the
accused/appellants is modified as indicated below.
23.            On conviction, the accused/appellant Uttam Gowala is sentenced
to imprisonment for 2 (two) months with a fine of Rs. 500/- for
commission of the offence under Section 323 of the IPC. He is sentenced to
Simple Imprisonment for 3 (three) months and a fine of Rs, 500/-, in
default, Simple Imprisonment for 1 (one) month for commission of the
offence under Section 427 of the IPC. Both the sentences will run
concurrently.
24.            On conviction, the accused/appellant Jitesh Gowala is sentenced
to imprisonment for 1 (one) year and 6 (six) months under Section 326 of
    Crl. A. No. 47 of 2009                                        Page 6 of 7

the IPC and a fine of Rs. 10,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, Simple
Imprisonment for another 3 (three) months.
25.            On realisation of the fine, the same should be given to the
injured persons in equal proportion as compensation.
26.            In view of the above, the present Criminal Appeal is partly
allowed.
27.            The accused/appellants will surrender before the Court of the
learned Sessions Judge, Silchar to serve out the sentence.
                                                                    JUDGE
