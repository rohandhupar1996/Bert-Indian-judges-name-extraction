         HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU
                            ORDER
         %                  27.02.2019
VIBHU BAKHRU, J
1.       The petitioner has filed the present petition, inter alia, impugning
an order dated 30.10.2017 passed by the Central Government rejecting the
petitioner‟s review application preferred under paragraph 12 of the Drugs
Price Control Order, 1995 (hereafter „the DPCO‟). The Central
Government (Reviewing Authority) had rejected the review petition on
the ground that the said petition is not maintainable against any
overcharging order under paragraph 13 of the DPCO, as it proceeded on
the basis that the demand order dated 11.05.2017, which was impugned
by the petitioner in the said review petition, was passed under paragraph
13 of the DPCO.
2.       This case has a chequered history. The petitioner is engaged in the
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                                Page 1 of 8

business of manufacturing pharmaceutical products including the
formulation „Fersis Caps‟. The said drug includes a bulk drug Vitamin B1
(Thiamine). Thiamine was included in the National List of Essential
Medicines. On 23.12.1998, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority
(NPPA) fixed the price of the said drug. Thereafter, on 27.09.2007, the
NPPA issued a Price Fixation Notification being S.O. 1665(E) dated
27.09.2007, fixing the price of certain formulations.          However, the
product Fersis Caps was not covered under the said Notification. The said
Notification was subsequently amended on 27.11.2008, by virtue of a
notification – S.O.2809(E).       By way of the said amendment, the
formulation Fersis Caps was included in the Price Fixation Notification.
3.       Thereafter, on 01.07.2009, the petitioner received a communication
from NPPA calling upon the petitioner to provide explanation for not
complying with the ceiling price in respect of the formulation Fersis Caps.
The petitioner responded to the same by a letter dated 17.07.2009
contending that the formulation was not covered under the Notification
dated 27.09.2007.
4.       On 18.09.2009, NPPA issued a show cause notice alleging that an
amount of `1,72,65,190/- was overcharged by the petitioner in respect of
the formulation Fersis Capsules, and called upon the petitioner to show
cause as to why the overcharged amount not be demanded from it. The
petitioner contested the said computation.
5.       Thereafter, on 06.10.2009, NPPA issued a demand notice directing
the petitioner to deposit a sum of `1,73,53,889/- which consisted of the
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                             Page 2 of 8

alleged overcharged amount as well as interest calculated at the rate of
15% p.a. on the overcharged amount upto 15.10.2009. This was followed
by another demand notice on 14.10.2009.
6.       Two years thereafter, NPPA sent yet another demand notice, inter
alia, refuting the petitioner‟s claim that the formulation in question was
not covered under the Price Notification dated 27.09.2007.
7.       On 18.11.2013, NPPA issued another demand notice demanding a
sum of `2,87,62,140/- in respect of overcharging in respect of the drug in
question.       This included an amount of `1,57,79,895/- as the amount
overcharged and interest computed at `1,29,82,245/-. This was followed
by a Recovery Certificate, which was issued by the NPPA on 28.01.2014.
8.       The petitioner challenged the recovery proceedings by filing a writ
petition being W.P.(C) 1838/2014. Pursuant to the said writ petition, the
petitioner deposited a sum of `1,57,79,895/- (being the amount of
allegedly overcharged by the petitioner) with NPPA. It also furnished a
bank guarantee for a sum of `1,36,30,734/- to the Registry of this Court.
The aforementioned writ petition was disposed of on 23.02.2015, inter
alia, directing the petitioner to file a review petition before the reviewing
authority and further directing it to pass a reasoned order.
9.       Pursuant to the aforesaid directions, the petitioner filed a Review
Petition on 18.03.2015. This petition was disposed of by the Reviewing
Authority (Central Government) by an order dated 19.10.2015, wherein it
was held that the petitioner was liable to pay the amount overcharged with
effect from 27.11.2008 along with interest.            Insofar as the period
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                               Page 3 of 8

commencing from 27.11.2008 is concerned, the Reviewing Authority
observed that NPPA could initiate action against the petitioner for not
filing an appropriate application under paragraph 8(2) of the DPCO.
10.      Thereafter, on 16.12.2015, NPPA issued another demand notice
claiming a sum of `3,81,26,977/-. This amount also included amounts on
account of sales made by the petitioner for the period September, 2007 to
September, 2008.
11.      An amount of `1,57,79,895/- already paid by the petitioner was
adjusted against the aforesaid amount, and NPPA claimed the balance
amount of `2,23,47,082/- as the balance payable towards unauthorized
sale as well as overcharged amount in respect of drug Fersis Caps. In
addition, NPPA also claimed interest of `1,86,76,163/-, which was
calculated upto 31.12.2015.
12.      Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner approached this Court by
filing a writ petition (being W.P.(C) 1706/2016) impugning the aforesaid
demand. The said petition was disposed of by this Court by an order
dated 02.03.2016, which reads as under:-
                    “Present writ petition has been filed challenging
            the demand notice dated 16th December, 2015 issued by
            the respondents on the ground that the same is in
            violation of principles of natural justice.
                    After some arguments, it is agreed between the
            counsel for the parties that the impugned demand notice
            dated 16th December, 2015 shall be treated as a show
            cause notice in accordance with the paragraph 8(2) of the
            Drugs (Price Control) order dated 6th January, 1995.
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                              Page 4 of 8

                    The petitioner is given an opportunity to file a
            reply to the said show cause notice within a period of
            three weeks.
                    The parties are directed to appear before the
            authority that issued the impugned notice, on 8th April,
            2016. The authority shall pass a reasoned order, which
            shall be communicated to the petitioner by way of
            registered AD post.
                    The bank guarantee furnished by the petitioner vide
            orders dated 21st March, 2014 and 4th April, 2014 in
            W.P.(C) No.1838/2014 shall be kept alive, till disposal of
            the proceedings.
                    In view thereof, the writ petition and the
            application are disposed of.
                    This Court however clarifies that it has not
            expressed any opinion on the merits of the controversy.
            The rights and contentions of all the parties are left
            open.”
13.      In compliance with the aforesaid order, an opportunity of personal
hearing was afforded to the petitioner on 12.05.2016 and the petitioner
also filed its written submissions. After considering the same, the said
proceedings culminated in an order dated 08.05.2017/11.05.2017,
whereby NPPA held that the petitioner was liable to pay a total
overcharged amount of `1,94,50,815/- from September, 2007 to June,
2009 and further interest of `1,91,69,987/- towards interest calculated
upto 31.05.2017.
14.      Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner filed a Review Petition under
paragraph 22 of the DPCO, inter alia, seeking review of the order dated
08.05.2017/11.05.2017.         However, the same has been rejected on the
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                               Page 5 of 8

ground that a review under paragraph 22 of the DPCO is not maintainable
against the order of demand issued under paragraph 13 of the DPCO.
15.      Before proceeding further, it would be relevant to refer paragraph
8(1) and 8(2) of the DPCO, which reads as under:-
           “8.      Power to fix retail price of Scheduled
                    Formulations: (1) The Government may, from
                    time to time, by order, fix the retail price of a
                    Scheduled formulation in accordance with the
                    formula laid down in paragraph 7.
                    (2) Where the Government fixes or revises the
                    price of any bulk drug under the provisions of
                    this Order and a manufacturer utilises such bulk
                    drug in his Scheduled formulations he shall,
                    within thirty days of such fixation or revisions,
                    make an application to the Government, in
                    Form-III for price revision of all such
                    formulation and the Government may, if it
                    considers necessary fix or revise the price of
                    such formulation.”
16.      It is apparent from the plain reading of the aforesaid paragraphs that
sub paragraph (2) of paragraph 8 of the DPCO makes it obligatory upon
manufacturer, which utilises a bulk drug for making a scheduled
formulation, to apply within a period of 30 days for fixation of revision in
price so fixed in Form III. And, if the Central Government considers it
necessary to fix or revise the price of such formulation, it shall do so.
17.      Admittedly, the petitioner had not applied for fixation of price of its
formulation after 27.09.2007. It is the petitioner‟s case that it was not
required to make any such application since the price had not been fixed
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                                 Page 6 of 8

by the Government and, therefore, the question of filing an application did
not arise. This was stoutly disputed by the NPPA and it was contended
that the price had already been fixed. It is in this context that this Court
had passed an order dated 02.03.2016 requiring the respondent to consider
the order dated 16.12.2015 as show cause under paragraph 8(1) of the
DPCO. Therefore, NPPA was required to examine, first of all whether
any price had been fixed in respect of the formulation; and second,
whether the petitioner was obliged to make an application under
paragraph 8(2) of the DPCO. NPPA was also required to consider the
review order dated 19.10.2015, whereby the Central Government had left
it open for NPPA to take an appropriate action under paragraph 8(2) of the
DPCO.         It does appear from the order dated 11.05.2017 that NPPA
proceeded to issue a demand without addressing any of the aforesaid
contentions. It is also seen from the table annexed to the said order that
the ceiling price for the formulation for the period 27.09.2007 to
27.11.2008 has been considered as „nil‟ and, therefore, the entire sale
proceeds collected by the petitioner is demanded as overcharged amount.
18.      It is seen that since the order was couched as demand notice under
paragraph 13 of the DPCO, the Central Government has rejected the
review as not maintainable. The Reviewing Authority has not considered
the context in which the said order was passed, particularly, the order
dated 02.03.2016 passed by this court, inter alia, directing that the
demand notice dated 16th December, 2015 be treated as a show cause
notice in accordance with the paragraph 8(2) of the DPCO.
19.      The plain import of the order dated 19.10.2015 is that NPPA was
W.P. (C) 11047/2017                                            Page 7 of 8

required to fix the price for the period 27.09.2007 to 27.11.2008 and,
therefore, determine the amount as overcharged. The said exercise has
also not been done. In view of the above, the impugned order dated
30.10.2017 as well as the order dated 08.05.2017/11/05.2017 are set aside
and the matter is remanded to the NPPA to decide afresh having regard to
the order dated 19.10.2015.
20.      The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. The bank
guarantees furnished by the petitioner with the Registrar General of this
Court shall continue to be kept alive till a fresh order is passed by the
NPPA.
21.      The pending application is disposed of.
22.      Order dasti.
