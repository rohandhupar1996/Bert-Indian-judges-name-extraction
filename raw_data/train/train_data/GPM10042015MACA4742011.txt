CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
                               JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 11.02.2011 passed
        by Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal whereby compensation of Rs.
        4,76,000/- was awarded for the death of Tej Prakash, who suffered
        fatal injuries in a motor vehicular accident which occurred on
        27.04.2006.
2.      There is twin challenge to the impugned judgment. First, negligence
        on the part of the driver of two wheeler bearing no.DL-4S-AD-7824
        was not established and second, the compensation awarded is
MAC APP 474/2011                                     Page 1 of 10

        excessive as in the absence of any evidence with regard to good future
        prospects, addition of 50% was not permissible.
3.      On the other hand, learned counsel for Respondents no.1 and 2 urges
        that negligence of the driver was sufficiently established from the
        testimony of PW2. It is urged by him that the compensation awarded
        is too meagre and low and the same needs to be enhanced.
NEGLIGENCE
4.      It is urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant that in respect of
        the accident, FIR No. 370/2006 was registered at Police Station
        Dwarka, Delhi. Statement of Abhay Kumar, driver of the two wheeler
        was recorded and on the basis of that statement, the criminal case was
        sent as untraced. It is urged that as per the statement made by the
        earlier said Abhay Kumar, some unknown vehicle had dashed against
        the two-wheeler from behind which was the cause of the accident.
        Thus, learned counsel for the Appellant argues that the accident was
        caused on account of negligence of an unknown vehicle and the
        insurer of two wheeler bearing no.DL-4S-AD-7824 is not liable to pay
        compensation for want of any negligence on the part of the driver of
        the two-wheeler.
MAC APP 474/2011                                     Page 2 of 10

5.      The Claims Tribunal dealt with the issue of negligence and discussed
        in detail the statement of Vasudev (PW2) , an eye witness of the
        accident.
6.      Eye-witness to the incident namely Vasudev, PW-2 deposed that on
        the date of the incident, he was present near the place of incident and
        he saw the motorcycle in question being driven at a very fast speed by
        Respondent no.1 Abhay Kumar, on which Tej Prakash was sitting on
        the pillion seat. He further deposed that the said motorcycle was being
        driven at a fast speed and its driver lost control over it. PW-2 deposed
        that the said motorcycle struck against the footpath, as a result of
        which Tej Prakash fell down and sustained injuries on his person. This
        witness was not at all cross examined on behalf of Respondents no.1
        and 2, who during the course of proceedings, failed to appear and were
        proceeded ex-parte. In cross-examination on behalf of the Insurance
        Company PW-2 stated that his statement was not recorded by the
        police.
7.      SI Rahul Kumar appeared in the witness box as PW-3 and proved
        copy of FIR as Ex. PW3/B. This witness however, on being cross
        examined stated that he was not the Investigating Officer of the
        present case and did not have any personal knowledge.
MAC APP 474/2011                                        Page 3 of 10

8.      Admittedly, the police on conclusion of investigation had prepared a
        final report. However, Petitioners during the course of proceedings
        had examined Sh. Vasudev, who categorically deposed that the
        accident took place in his presence. If the Investigating Officer during
        the course of investigation, for the reasons best known to him, failed
        to examine this witness, then lapse on the part of the investigating
        agency cannot stall the rights of the Petitioners to get compensation
        from the tortfeasor. Respondents no.1 and 2 during the course of
        proceedings had failed to appear and the Insurance Company had not
        summoned the Investigating Officer of the present case.
9.      Had the Investigating Officer appeared or been summoned by the
        Insurance Company, he could have disclosed the reasons for not
        recording statement of Vasudev during the course of investigation, but
        that was not done.
10.     Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and material
        on record, I am of the considered opinion that there is no involvement
        of any third vehicle in the present incident. More particularly, in view
        of the deposition of the eye witness to the incident PW2 Vasudev, who
        deposed that the motorcycle on which the deceased was travelling as
        pillion rider was being driven by Respondent no.1. As per the material
MAC APP 474/2011                                        Page 4 of 10

        on record, the said motorcycle struck against the footpath which
        resulted in this unfortunate accident and sustaining of fatal injuries on
        the person of deceased Tej Prakash, a bachelor son of the petitioners.
11.     Having regard to these facts, I am of the considered opinion that
        Respondent no.1 was driving the motorcycle at such a speed that he
        lost control over the same, which in itself speaks about the negligent
        manner in which he was driving the offender motorcycle.
12.     I may mention that the statement made by Abhay Kumar to the police
        under Section 161 Cr.P.C. can be used only for the purpose of
        contradiction. Statement of Abhay Kumar under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
        was rightly not given any value by the Claims Tribunal in view of the
        statement of Vasudev (PW2). It is possible that Abhay Kumar wanted
        to escape from the criminal liability and hence, the self serving
        statement made by him will be of no consequence. PW2 categorically
        deposed about the manner of the accident. He was categorical that the
        two-wheeler driver was driving the motorcycle bearing no.DL-4S-AD-
        7824 at a fast speed and that he had lost control. Although the veracity
        of PW2 was sought to be discredited in cross examination, however,
        nothing material could be extracted which would enable the court to
        discard his testimony.
MAC APP 474/2011                                       Page 5 of 10

13.     It is well established that in a Claim Petition under Section 161 of the
        Act, negligence is required to be proved on touchstone of
        preponderance of probability. In view of the above, negligence was
        sufficiently established.
QUANTUM OF COMPENSATION
14.     During inquiry before the Tribunal, it was claimed that deceased Tej
        Prakash was employed with M/s Bar Tech Systems & Automations
        Pvt. Ltd., address of which was also given in the claim petition. It was
        further stated that he was earning a salary of Rs. 8000/- per month.
        Although averment with regard to the same was made by PW-1
        Kedarnath in his evidence by way of Affidavit (Ex. PW1/1); at the
        same time no documentary evidence was produced with regard to the
        deceased’s     income.    However,    it  was    established  from   the
        unchallenged testimony of PW1 and also from host of the documents
        placed on record that deceased Tej Prakash was a Graduate from
        Rajasthan University with Economics as one of the subjects. He was
        not only a Graduate but he had also obtained advanced diploma in
        computers from the Department of Ministry of Commication &
        Information Technology, Government of India. He had passed O
        Level DOEACC Exams. He had also obtained certificate course from
        UP Tech titled DTP (Desktop Publication). He further obtained
MAC APP 474/2011                                        Page 6 of 10

        advance diploma in computer application from Computer Software
        Ltd , Jaipur.
15.     Appellant Insurance Company had not led any evidence on the basis
        of its investigation that the deceased was not employed with M/s Bar
        Tech Systems & Automations Pvt. Ltd., Mohan Garden, New Delhi.
        Even if the Claim Tribunal disbelieves the claimant’s version that the
        deceased was earning Rs. 8000/- per month from the earlier said
        employer, it ought to have made assessment of the deceased’s income
        on the basis of his qualifications and ought not to have given
        compensation merely on the basis of him being a Graduate.
16.     In view of this, I am inclined to believe that the income of deceased
        was Rs.8000/- p.m. as claimed. At the same time, the Respondents
        were not entitled to addition towards future prospects in the absence of
        any evidence with regard to the same in view of the report of the
        Supreme Court in Reshma Kumari and Ors. v. Madan Mohan and
        Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 65 and a judgment of this Court in HDFC ERGO
        General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Lalta Devi & Ors., MAC. APP.
        189/2014 decided on 12.01.2015.
17.     The mother of the deceased was aged 48 years at the time of the
        accident. On applying a multiplier of 13 and 1/2 deduction towards
MAC APP 474/2011                                       Page 7 of 10

        personal and living expenses, the loss of dependency will come to
        Rs.6,24,000/- (8000 x 1/2 x 12 x 13).
18.     In addition, in view of the three Judge Bench decision of the Supreme
        Court in Rajesh & Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 54,
        Respondents no.1 and 2 are further entitled to a sum of ` 1,00,000/-
        towards loss of love and affection, `25,000/- towards funeral expenses
        and `10,000/- towards loss to estate.
19.     The overall compensation thus comes to Rs.7,59,000/-.
20.     The compensation is therefore enhanced by Rs.2,83,000/- which shall
        carry interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim
        petition till its payment.
21.     It is true that in the present case, no Cross-Appeal or Cross-Objections
        have been filed by the Respondents. The question was examined by
        me in Oriental Insurance Company Limited v. Mamta Rani & Ors.,
        MAC APP.629/2010, decided on 06.09.2012 wherein this Court
        noticed the Supreme Court judgments in Nagappa v. Gurudayal
        Singh, (2003) 2 SCC 274; Ibrahim v. Raju, AIR 2012 SC 534; New
        India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Gopali & Ors., Civil Appeal No.5179 of
        2012 decided on 05.07.2012 and a judgment of the learned Single
        Judge of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Komal & Ors.,
MAC APP 474/2011                                        Page 8 of 10

        MANU/DE/2870/2012, and held that the Court can increase the
        compensation without filing any Cross Appeal or Cross Objections.
22.     Thus, I do not find any impediment in increasing the compensation in
        favour of the Respondents/Claimants.
23.     80% of the enhanced compensation shall be for the benefit of
        Respondent no. 2, rest 20% shall be paid to Respondent no.1.
24.     50% of the enhanced compensation awarded to each of the
        Respondents shall be kept in fixed deposit for one year and rest shall
        be released on deposit.
25.     The compensation deposited in pursuance of the order dated
        25.05.2011 shall be released in terms of the order passed by the
        Claims Tribunal.
26.     Enhanced compensation of Rs.2,83,000/- along with interest as
        indicated earlier shall be deposited by the Appellant Insurance
        Company in UCO Bank, Delhi High Court Branch, New Delhi within
        a period of 6 weeks from today, failing which Respondents no.1 and 2
        shall be entitled to interest @ 12% per annum from the date of this
        judgment.
27.     The appeal is disposed of in above terms.
MAC APP 474/2011                                     Page 9 of 10

28.     The pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
29.     Statutory amount, if any, deposited shall be refunded to the Appellant
        Insurance Company after the enhanced compensation is deposited and
        certificate of compliance is filed by the Insurance Company.
