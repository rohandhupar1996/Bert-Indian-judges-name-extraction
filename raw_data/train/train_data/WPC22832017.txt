Date of Judgment                            :02.08.2017
                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER( ORAL)
           Heard Mr. H Das, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.
AD Sharma, the learned counsel for the respondents, APDCL.
2.           The learned counsel for the APDCL submits that he is yet to
receive instructions in the matter and he may be granted some time to file
affidavit-in-opposition in the matter. However, considering the controversy
the writ petition is taken up for disposal.
3.             Mr. Das, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner submits
that the petitioner has retired from the post of Subordinate Engineer
Grade-II on 29.02.2016.        However, the respondent authorities upon
coming to learn that the pay fixation of the petitioner and the increments
given to him on his promotion to the post on 09.11.1989 was wrongly
fixed, a calculation of his pay increment has been made by the respondent
authorities    on    06.07.2016     (Annexure-VI)    and     thereafter,   vide
communication dated 07.10.2016 (Annexure-VII), the Deputy Personnel
Manager of the APDCL wrote to the Assistant General Manager, Dhubri
Electrical Division, APDCL to prepare a fresh ‘Last Pay Certificate’ and ‘No
Due Certificate’ showing the actual liability of the petitioner. In view of the
steps taken by the respondent authorities, the learned counsel for the writ
petitioner submits that the respondents have contemplated recovery from
the petitioner’s retirement benefits. He submits that as the petitioner is a
retired employee and he has no responsibility on fixation of his pay and
        WP (C) No. 2283 of 2017                              Page 2 of 5

the respondents cannot be allowed to make any recovery on the
overdrawn amount.
4.             Mr. H Das by referring to the decision of the Apex Court
rendered in the case of State of Punjab –vs- Rafiq Masih & Ors reported in
(2015) 4 SCC 334, submits that the recovery from an employee after his
retirement would not be permissible if such fixation of pay or excess
payment is not attributed to the employee. The Apex Court in fact laid
down a few situation wherein recovery by the employer would not be
permissible. It has been held that recovery from employees belonging to
Class-III and Class-IV (Group-C and Group-D) would not be permissible
and also recovery from a retired employee who was due to retire within
one year from the order of recovery amongst others. He submits that the
case of the petitioner is therefore covered by the said decision.
5.              Mr. H Das also refers to the decision of this Court rendered
in the case of Dipendra Nath Tahkuria & Ors –vs- Assam State Electricity
Board & Ors reported in 2015 (4) GLT 32 wherein recovery from the
terminal benefits of the petitioner therein was interfered with by relying
upon the judgment of the Apex Court Rafiq Masih (supra).
6.              I have considered the submissions advanced by the rival
parties and perused the relevant materials on record including the decision
relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
7.             The petitioner was promoted to the post of E/S Grade-II in
the pay scale of Rs.1360-2305/- per month vide order dated 9.11.1989
and after serving in the said post with the pay scale that was fixed, he
       WP (C) No. 2283 of 2017                             Page 3 of 5

was given superannuation notice on 29.12.2015 stating that he was due
to retire w.e.f. 29.2.2016 and therefore, relevant document was sought
from him for preparation of his pension and gratuity. Although he was
released on superannuation w.e.f. 29.2.2016, it was discovered that his
pay was wrongly fixed and therefore after rectification of his fixation of
pay w.e.f. 10.4.1989, the Assistant General Manager (F & A), Audit Wing,
APDCL vide communication dated 6.7.2016 informed the Deputy Personnel
Manager (respondent No.2) to work out the over drawn amount and
record the same in his service book for recovery from his terminal
benefits. However, having regard to the decision of the Apex Court as well
as the Judgment and order rendered by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court
in the case of Dipendra Nath Tahkuria (supra), I am of the considered
opinion that since the fixation of pay was done by the respondent
authorities, the petitioner cannot be taxed with the recovery of overdrawal
from his terminal benefit as he retired on superannuation on 29.2.2016. In
other words, the decision referred to above covers the case of the
petitioner.
8.             In that view of the matter, the interim order passed by this
Court on 21.4.2017 is hereby made absolute . The communication dated
6.7.2016 (Annexure-VI) so far as recovery of over drawn amount from the
petitioner’s terminal benefit is contemplated is hereby set aside. The
respondent authorities shall process the pension papers of the petitioner
and accord him his pensionary dues as expeditiously as possible preferably
within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt of a certified
copy of this order.

9.        With the above observation and direction, the writ petition stands
allowed. No costs.
