     ADDT. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS                       ..... Respondent

     CORAM:
     HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE REKHA PALLI
     REKHA PALLI, J (ORAL)
     1.     Vide the present petition, the petitioner seeks setting aside of
     the order dated 19.08.2002 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
     Judge, upholding the conviction of the petitioner u/s 132 and
     135(1)(a) of the Customs Act by the learned Additional Chief
     Metropolitan Magistrate by his order dated 09.04.2002.
     2.     The relevant facts emerging from the record are that by an
     order dated 09.04.2002 passed by the learned Additional Chief
     Metropolitan Magistrate, the petitioner was convicted of offences
     under sections 132 and 135(1)(a) of the Customs Act for evading
     customs duties payable on the import of certain household items. The
     petitioner was not only sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment
     for a period of 6 months but was mulcted with a fine of Rs. 50,000/-
     CRL.REV.P. 684/2002                                Page 1 of 4

on each count, in default of which he was directed to undergo one and
a half months of simple imprisonment for each of the offences.
3.     Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of conviction, the petitioner
preferred an appeal before the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
which was dismissed vide order dated 19.08.2002. Against the said
order of dismissal, the petitioner preferred the present petition before
this Court.
4.     Mr.Deepak Gandhi, learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that the petitioner does not assail the impugned order insofar as he
was convicted under the Customs Act, but only seeks suspension of
the substantive sentence awarded to him. He submits that a fine of
Rs.1 lakh already stands paid and the petitioner has already
undergone two months of rigorous imprisonment after the six months’
sentence was awarded to him.
5.     Mr.Deepak Gandhi further submits that as on date, the
petitioner is over 70 years of age and the role attributable to him was
in any case not more than that of the co-accused, Ms.Rosy Chawla in
whose case this Court vide order dated 26.02.2009 in Crl.Rev.P.
No.652/2002, has already waived the remaining sentence imposed
upon her after she had undergone imprisonment of about one week.
6.     Mr.Satish Agarwal, learned standing counsel for the respondent
does not dispute the aforesaid position and also concedes that there is
no minimum sentence prescribed under the Customs Act for the
goods in respect of which the petitioner was convicted. He fairly also
does not oppose that the petitioner is entitled to be given the same
treatment as has been granted to the co-accused Ms.Rosy Chawla, but
CRL.REV.P. 684/2002                                 Page 2 of 4

requests that some additional fine be imposed on the petitioner.
7.     I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
record. Upon examining the order dated 09.04.2002 passed by the
learned Additional Metropolitan Magistrate as also the order dated
19.08.2002 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, it
becomes evident that the petitioner, while working as the authorized
representative of the co-accused Ms. Rosy Chawla, had smuggled
certain goods having a total value of Rs.8,30,000/- (approx.) into the
country by omitting to declare/misdeclaring the same before the
Customs Authorities. While the smuggled items in question belonged
to Ms. Rosy Chawla, the only role admittedly attributable to the
petitioner is that on the instructions of the said Ms. Rosy Chawla, he
helped clear the customs formalities in respect thereof in India. In
doing so, the petitioner misdeclared the smuggled goods and stated on
the relevant form that they were brought to India only on account of
Ms.Rosy      Chawla’s     transfer  of   residence.   However,     during
investigation, the said goods were discovered to be brand new
purchases. It is, thus, apparent that the culpability of the petitioner is
on the same if not lower footing as that of the co-accused Ms. Rosy
Chawla.
8.     In the light of the above and after carefully perusing the order
dated 09.04.2002 passed by the learned Additional Metropolitan
Magistrate, order dated 19.08.2002 passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge and order dated 26.02.2009 passed by this Court in
Crl.Rev.P. No.652/2002, I am of the considered opinion that the
petitioner is entitled to the same benefit as granted to the co-accused,
CRL.REV.P. 684/2002                                  Page 3 of 4

Ms. Rosy Chawla.
9.    Accordingly, in view of the peculiar facts of the present case
and for parity of reasons, while affirming the order of conviction,
subject to the petitioner depositing an additional fine of Rs.25,000/-,
the sentence awarded to him is reduced to the period already
undergone and accordingly, his remaining sentence is waived. The
respondent will release the passport of the petitioner as and when he
approaches them alongwith the proof of deposit of additional fine as
imposed hereinabove.
10.   The petition alongwith pending applications is disposed of in
the above terms.
                                                    (REKHA PALLI)
