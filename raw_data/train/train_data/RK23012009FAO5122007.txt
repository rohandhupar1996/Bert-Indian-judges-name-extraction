REVA KHETRAPAL, J
C.M. No. 11770/08 in FAO (OS) No. 512/07:
1.      This is an application filed by the appellants under Section 114 read with
Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for recalling of order dated 3rd March,
2008.
FAO (OS) 512/2007                                                           Page 1 of 3

2.     An appeal was preferred by the appellants against the order dated 6 th July,
2007 passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the application filed by the
appellants praying for setting aside the ex parte decree. All the contentions which
are now raised in this application and argued before us have already been
considered and dealt with by a Division Bench of this Court of which one of us
(Reva Khetrapal, J.) was a member. The relevant portion of the order dealing with
the contentions again sought to be raised before us reads as under:
           “4.      The aforesaid contention of the appellant was considered by
           the learned Single Judge. The learned Single Judge has
           appreciated the averments made in the application and found the
           ground stated therein for non-appearance to be vague. In the said
           application, the only statement that was made by the appellants is
           that despite due diligence, both the defendants No. 1 and 2 could
           not put in appearance. However, the documents filed in support of
           the contention in the said application were in the nature of some
           medical records. The said medical records which are filed by the
           appellants in support of the averments made in the application are
           of the period prior to the year 1992. The suit was directed to be
           proceeded ex parte by an order dated 14.12.2005 whereas the suit
           filed by the appellants was dismissed for non-prosecution on
           13.09.2004. There is only one medical certificate after the year
           1992, which is of the year December, 1999 to the effect that Mr.
           Vijay Kumar Bhatia has angina problem. Persons with such
           problems are also prosecuting their cases effectively in Courts and,
           therefore, the learned Single Judge did not find sufficient cause
           either to recall the order dated 13.09.2004 or to set aside the ex
           parte decree passed in the suit.
           5.       The grounds given are assailed before us by the counsel
           appearing for the appellants very vehemently contending, inter alia,
           that if the appellant was unwell, in that event the learned Single
           Judge should have set aside the ex parte decree and also should
           have recalled the order dated 13.09.2004 dismissing the suit filed by
           the appellants for non-prosecution and given opportunity to the
           appellants to proceed with both the suits.
           6        We are, however, unable to accept the aforesaid contention
           of the counsel appearing for the appellants for the simple reason
           that it appears the suit was coming up to a close as it was at the
FAO (OS) 512/2007                                                               Page 2 of 3

            stage of recording of evidence. The appellants, at least in the suit
            filed by the respondent, should not have defaulted in making
            appearance and thereby allowed the suit to be proceeded ex parte.
            Even thereafter, no steps were taken by him to get the said order
            vacated. The record shows that after the suit was directed to be
            proceeded ex parte and the same proceeded accordingly, and an ex
            parte decree was passed after about a year of the said date, for the
            first time an application was filed for setting aside the decree. That
            also on the ground of medical reasons, which is again unsupported
            by the documents on records for the relevant period during which
            the aforesaid default was committed by the appellants.
            7.       There are some further documents sought to be placed on
            record which we are not inclined to look into at this stage. They were
            not placed before the learned Single Judge, and appear to have
            been placed on record as an afterthought. Since those were not
            placed before the learned Single Judge, we are not inclined to look
            at the said documents”.
3.     This Court has already come to the conclusion that the appellants are not
entitled for any relief from this Court. There is no merit in this application. Hence
the same is dismissed.
CM No. 11771 (U/O 43 R 2 read with Order 41 Rule 27 (1)(B) and CM No.
11772/08 (under Section 5 of Limitation Act)
4.      In view of the order passed in the review application, these applications do
not survive for consideration. The same are accordingly dismissed.
