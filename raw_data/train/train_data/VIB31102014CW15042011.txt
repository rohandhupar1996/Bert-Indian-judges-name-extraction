HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU
                                   JUDGMENT
VIBHU BAKHRU, J
1.       This petition has been filed by the petitioner inter alia seeking that a
direction be issued to respondent no.2 (hereafter ‘DSIIDC’) to hand over
the possession of the plot No.3/L/2, admeasuring 250 sq. mtrs. situated at
Bawana Industrial Complex, Delhi on receiving the amount for the excess
area in terms of paragraph no.10(1) of the order dated 16.02.2010 passed by
the Supreme Court in SLP(C) No.20462/2008 titled ‘Delhi State Industrial
& Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. & Anr. v. Skylark
Engineering Works & Anr..’
2.       Briefly stated, the relevant facts are that the petitioner was running a
small scale industrial enterprise from premises No.11/219, Geeta Colony,
Delhi, which was a non-conforming area. In the year 1996, DSIIDC invited
applications from the industries in the non-conforming area for shifting to
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                                   Page 1 of 10

the conforming area in pursuance of the decision of the Supreme Court in
MC Mehta’s case. The petitioner applied for a plot of land measuring 400
sq. mtrs. (Application No.26756) under the relocation scheme, however, he
was allotted a plot measuring 250 sq. mtrs. in Bawana Industrial Complex.
On 03.04.1998, the said allotment was communicated by DSIIDC to the
petitioner and on 23.10.2000 the allotment cum demand letter was also
issued to the petitioner. On 30.04.2001, a No Objection Certificate was
issued by DSIIDC in favour of the petitioner to mortgage the allotted plot
of 250 sq. mtrs. to Delhi Financial Corporation (DFC) from whom the
petitioner had sought a loan and for that purpose a tripartite agreement
dated 15.05.2001 was also executed between the petitioner, DSIIDC and
DFC.
3.       In the meantime, a meeting of the High Power Implementation
Committee was held on 07.06.1999 wherein a decision was taken that the
size of the plot recommended should not exceed double the area presently
occupied by the unit and maximum size of plot offered would be 250 sq.
mtrs. However, in some cases, the allottees were allotted plots larger than
their entitlement under the policy and therefore, the said allotments were
cancelled and allottees were offered downsized alternative plots. DSIIDC
stated that the petitioner was allotted a plot of size more than its entitlement
as - on the basis of the area occupied by the petitioner - he was eligible for
a plot measuring only 100 sq. mtrs. Therefore, the earlier allotment was
cancelled and a downsized plot bearing no.103 situated at pocket H, Sector
3, measuring 100 sq. mtrs. was allotted to the petitioner. An allotment cum
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                               Page 2 of 10

demand letter dated 24.09.2004 for the said plot of 100 sq. mtrs was also
issued to the petitioner.
4.       The allottees who did not accept downsized plots challenged the
decision of DSIIDC before this court in writ petitions, which were disposed
of by a Single Judge of this court in terms of its judgment dated 08.12.2005
reported as: PVC Compound & Footwear Manufacturers Association
(Regd) & Others v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors: 125 (2005) DLT 616.
This Court set aside the decision of downsizing of plots allotted to
applicants who had been allotted larger plots in excess of their entitlement;
this court held that a concluded contract had come into effect and a
direction was given to the respondents to restore the allotment in favour of
the applicants. It is to be noted that the petitioner had not challenged the
downsizing of his plot before this court, but, it is contended that the
petitioner, had protested against the said downsizing.
5.       The said decision of the Single Judge was challenged before a
Division Bench of this Court in LPA No.168-169/2006 and other connected
matters. By an order dated 18.03.2008, the Division Bench upheld the
decision of the Single Judge. The order of the Division Bench was
challenged before the Supreme Court in Skylark Engineering (supra). By
an order dated 16.02.2010, the Supreme Court upheld the order of the
Division Bench but modified the rate to be charged for the excess area of
the plot. In addition, the Supreme Court also issued other directions for
effective implementation of the order passed by the division bench of this
Court.

6.       According to the petitioner, the petitioner neither accepted the
downsized plot nor sought any refund of the amount paid to DSIIDC. It is
further asserted that the plot allotted to the petitioner has not been allotted
to any third party. It was contended that therefore, in terms of paragraph
no.10(1) of the order dated 16.02.2010 passed by the Supreme Court in
Skylark Engineering (supra), the petitioner would fall under the category
of 106 allottees who did not accept the offer of downsized plot and the
petitioner is ready and willing to pay the amount for the excess area of the
plot allotted, that is, 150 sq. mtrs.
Submissions
7.       It was submitted by the petitioner that with the acceptance of the
allotment of the plot of 250 sq. mtrs., the contract between DSIIDC and
petitioner was concluded and DSIIDC could not unilaterally modify the
terms and conditions of the contract by reducing the size of the plot by its
letter dated 24.09.2004.
8.       The learned counsel for DSIIDC submitted that the decision of the
Supreme Court passed in Skylark Engineering (supra) is not applicable to
the present case as the petitioner falls in the category of people who had
accepted the downsized plot and did not challenge the downsizing of plot.
It was submitted that requests of the petitioner, for considering allotment of
plot of 250 sq. mtrs., were rejected by DSIIDC and the said rejections were
not challenged by the petitioner at any point of time.
9.       It was submitted that the allotment of plot of 250 sq. mtrs. to the
petitioner was cancelled in 2002 and the petitioner had filed the present
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                              Page 4 of 10

petition in the year 2011, that is,    after a lapse of about nine years.
Therefore, the petition was barred by time and latches. It was contended
that even in the present petition, the petitioner had not challenged the
downsizing of the plot in question and, thus, had waived its right, if any, to
challenge the cancellation of plot measuring 250 sq. mtrs. Further, the
entire amount towards the plot measuring 250 sq. mtrs. was not paid by the
petitioner and there was no concluded contract between the petitioner and
DSIIDC.
Reasons and Conclusion
10.      Admittedly, the petitioner was allotted a plot measuring 250 sq.
mtrs.. Allotment cum demand letter was also issued and subsequently, a
No objection Certificate was also issued to enable the petitioner to obtain
loan from DFC. The petitioner had applied for a loan and was also
sanctioned one by DFC. However, before the loan could be disbursed, the
allotment of the plot was cancelled by a letter dated 12.12.2002.
Subsequently, on 24.09.2004 an allotment of a plot measuring 100 sq. mtrs.
in lieu of the originally allotted larger plot was made in favour of the
petitioner. Apparently, 521 persons had been allotted plots which were
larger in size than their entitlement as per the policy of DSIIDC. These
allotments were subsequently cancelled (the petitioner’s allotment
included). A Single Judge of this Court examined the question as to the
legality of the action of DSIIDC in cancelling the allotments that were
stated to have been made inadvertently in excess of the entitlement. This
Court came to the conclusion that a concluded contract had come into
existence and it was not open for DSIIDC to unilaterally cancel the said
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                           Page 5 of 10

allotments. This Court also noted that prior to cancellation, no show cause
notice had been issued to the allotees and thus, the action of DSIIDC in
cancelling the allotments was not sustainable. A Division Bench of this
Court sustained the said decision. DSIIDC preferred a Special Leave
Petition before the Supreme Court which was allowed. The Supreme Court
noted that out of 521 allotees, 387 allotees had accepted the downsized
plots in lieu of the originally allotted larger plots. Further, out of remaining
134 allotees, 28 allotees had, subsequently, accepted possession of the
downsized plots. The others, in all 106 allotees, had not accepted the offer
of downsized plots. After considering the facts, the Supreme Court did not
interfere with the decision of the Division Bench of this Court except made
certain modifications including directing that the area in excess of the
entitled allotment to be paid at twice the stated rate.
11.      In view of the decision of this Court in PVC Compound & Footwear
Manufacturers Association (supra) as well as the Supreme Court in
Skylark Engineering (supra), it cannot be disputed that with the issuance
of the allotment letter and its acceptance, a concluded contract was arrived
at between the petitioner and DSIIDC. However, it is settled law that any
action for enforcement of a contract ought to be taken within the period of
limitation as specified and the Courts would not aid a litigant who has
approached the Court belatedly and has not been diligent in pursuing his
remedies. The question that needs to be now addressed is whether the
petitioner is entitled to the benefit of the decision of the Supreme Court in
Skylark Engineering (Supra).
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                                Page 6 of 10

12.      DSIIDC has considered the petitioner to be one of 387 allottees who
had accepted the downsized plot in view of the originally allotted larger
plot; the petitioner was not considered as one of the 106 allottees who had
reportedly not accepted the allotment.
13.      Although the petitioner has contended that he had not accepted a
downsized plot, the facts indicate that the petitioner had not raised any
protest at the material time. The petitioner had arranged for a loan to pay
for a larger plot from DFC. The documentation in this regard was also
completed. However, before the loan could be disbursed, the petitioner
received a letter dated 12.12.2002 informing the petitioner that the plot in
its favour stood cancelled. Accordingly, the loan was not released in favour
of the petitioner and the amount was also not disbursed by DFC to DSIIDC.
Apparently, the petitioner took no steps to impugn the cancellation of the
allotment at the material time. Subsequently, the petitioner was allotted a
plot measuring 100 sq. mtrs. This was communicated to the petitioner by a
letter dated 24.09.2004. There is nothing on record to indicate that this was
objected to by the petitioner. Even, if it is accepted that the petitioner did
not want to approach the courts, the least that is expected of a person
objecting to an action is lodgment of his protest; if the petitioner was
seriously aggrieved he would have protested against the action of DSIIDC.
But, no contemporaneous communication has been presented by the
petitioner which would indicate that he was dissatisfied with the alternative
allotment at the material time.
14.      In response to the cancellation notice of 12.12.2002, the petitioner –
after a lapse of nearly four years – sent a letter on 15.02.2006 requesting
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                              Page 7 of 10

that allotment of a plot of 250 sq. mtrs. be considered. This was rejected by
DSIIDC by its letter dated 18.08.2006 and the petitioner was confirmed that
its case could not be considered as per the policy. No further steps were
taken by the petitioner thereafter and the petitioner rested content.
15.      The Supreme Court delivered the decision in Skylark Engineering
(supra) on 16.02.2010. Even after the decision, the petitioner did not
immediately approach DSIIDC. In the meanwhile, DSIIDC invited all
allottees to accept possession of the plots allotted; DSIIDC also issued
advertisement in leading newspapers on 22.10.2010 inviting the allottees to
take possession within 16 days thereof subject to deposit of the requisite
watch and ward charges as well as penalty for delayed construction.
Despite the aforesaid notice, the petitioner neither raised any objection nor
came forward to accept the possession of the allotted plot. Finally on
20.01.2011, DSIIDC issued a letter calling upon the petitioner to show
cause why the allotment in its favour not be cancelled for failure “to take
possession, construct factory and relocate a unit at the allotted premises”.
The said notice further gave a final opportunity to the petitioner to take
possession by paying the requisite charges. This, apparently, prompted the
petitioner to approach this Court by filing this petition in March 2011.
Indisputably, the petitioner has been lax in pursuing his remedies but more
importantly, the petitioner had clearly not protested against the downsizing
of the plot and in that sense was rightly considered as an allottee who had
accepted the decision to allot a smaller plot in lieu of the original allotment.
16.      Although it is well settled, that there is no period of limitation
prescribed for filing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                               Page 8 of 10

India, however, the Courts have refrained from exercising jurisdiction in
favour of the litigants who have not been diligent in pursuing their
remedies. The Supreme Court in the case of Bangalore City Coop.
Housing Society Ltd. v. State of Karnataka: (2012) 3 SCC 727 explained
the said principle in the following words:-
          “45. We have considered the respective arguments. The
          Framers of the Constitution have not prescribed any period of
          limitation for filing a petition under Article 226 of the
          Constitution and it is only one of the several rules of self-
          imposed restraint evolved by the superior courts that the
          jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the
          Constitution, which is essentially an equity jurisdiction,
          should not be exercised in favour of a person who approaches
          the Court after a long lapse of time and no cogent explanation
          is given for the delay.”
17.      In Delhi Admn. v. Kaushilya Thakur: (2012) 5 SCC 412, the
Supreme Court set aside the decision of this Court in directing allotment of
a plot of land pursuant to a writ petition that was preferred after a delay of
more than three years. The relevant extract of the said decision is quoted
below:-
           “10. We have heard Shri H.P. Raval, learned Additional
           Solicitor General and Shri Rishikesh, learned counsel for
           Respondent 1 and perused the record. In our view, the
           impugned order [Delhi Admn. v. Ranjodh Kumar, LPA No.
           25 of 2004, order dated 22-9-2010 (Del)] as also the one
           passed by the learned Single Judge [ WP (C) No. 4450 of
           1993, order dated 13-3-2003 (Del)] are liable to be set aside
           because while granting relief to the husband of Respondent 1,
           the learned Single Judge overlooked the fact that the writ
           petition had been filed after almost 4 years of the rejection of
           an application for allotment of 1000 sq yd plot made by
           Ranjodh Kumar Thakur. The fact that the writ petitioner made
W.P.(C) No. 1504/2011                                               Page 9 of 10

           further representations could not be made a ground for
           ignoring the delay of more than 3 years, more so because in
           the subsequent communication the authorities concerned had
           merely indicated that the decision contained in the first letter
           would stand.
           11. It is trite to say that in exercise of the power under Article
           226 of the Constitution, the High Court cannot entertain
           belated claims unless the petitioner offers tangible explanation
           (State of M.P. v. Bhailal Bhai [AIR 1964 SC 1006 : (1964) 6
           SCR 261] ).”
18.      In the given facts, the benefit of the decision of the Supreme Court in
Skylark Engineering (supra) cannot be extended to the petitioner: the
petitioner’s prayer for a direction to DSIIDC to handover possession of the
Plot No. 3/L/2 (250 sq. mtrs.) situated at Bawana Industrial Complex, Delhi
cannot be accepted. However, in the given facts, it would be only fair, if the
petitioner is granted the opportunity to take possession of the Plot No.
103/3/H (100 sq. mtrs.) at Bawana Industrial Complex, Delhi on payment
of the requisite charges. Accordingly, the present petition is disposed of
with a direction to DSIIDC to handover the possession of Plot No. 103/3/H
at Bawana Industrial Complex to the petitioner if the petitioner deposits the
requisite charges, if any are due, within a period of 60 days.
                                                           VIBHU BAKHRU, J
