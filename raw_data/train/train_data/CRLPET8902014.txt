         Heard Mr. A. Choudhury learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. B.B.
Gogoi, learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the State.
         Though notice was served on respondent No. 2, the complainant and that
the Registry received back the A/D Card after service of notice of the case, the said
respondent did not enter appearance in the matter and as such this proceeding
proceeded exparte against the said respondent.
Crl. Ptn. No. 890 of 2014                                                 Page 1 of 5

         The respondent No. 2 on 29.04.2014 as a complainant filed a criminal
complainant before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi being CR Case
No. 409C/2014 against the petitioner alleging commission of offences under
Sections 420/406 IPC by him and the learned CJM, Hailakandi perusing the said
compliant forwarded the same to the Officer-in-Charge of Lala Police Station to
register a case, enquire in to the matter and submit report. On receipt of the said
complaint on 14.05.2015 from learned CJM, Hailakandi, it was registered as Lala
Police Station Case No.124/2014 under Sections 420/406 IPC corresponding to GR
No. 606/2014.
         Being aggrieved, pertaining to said registration of Lala P.S. Case No.
124/2014, the petitioner have preferred this criminal petition for quashing and
setting aside the said criminal proceeding against him stating that the allegation
made by the complainant/respondent No. 2 in said complaint being CR Case No.
409C/2014, which now treated as FIR with regard to said Lala P.S. Case, do not
prima facie constitute any offence triable by criminal court as it does not disclose
any cognizable offence justifying the investigation by police and same was filed and
lodged by the complainant/respondent No. 2 with malafide intention for wracking
vengeances against the petitioner and to harass him due to his private and
personal grudge. In this regard the petitioner placed before the court that the
allegation against him is that he verbally engaged the complainant/respondent No.
2 in a construction work, promising him that on completion of the work he would
give him half of the profit and on that understanding, the complainant engaged the
workers, arranged JCB, stone chips, sand etc. and spent Rs 3,94,611/- and that in
that regard cash memos and the account was already handed over to him. It is also
placed that in said complainant, further allegation against the petitioner is that he
promised him to provide winger vehicle under self help group scheme and on said
hope, the said complainant/respondent No. 2 paid Rs 1,00,000/- as an advance and
all total paid Rs.3,00,000/-per head on 11.02.2000 to him and according to the said
complainant he had already spent Rs 3,94,611/- and that the petitioner is required
to pay him an amount of Rs. 5,72,305/-, out of which the petitioner paid him Rs.
1,50,000/- by way of cheque and the remaining amount Rs. 4,22,305/- is yet to be
paid.
Crl. Ptn. No. 890 of 2014                                                 Page 2 of 5

         The petitioner submits before the Court that the allegation made by
complainant/respondent No. 2 are vague, frivolous, fabricated and not based on
facts and the said complaint has been filed with malafide intention, since no
prudent person would believe that someone would spent such a huge amount on
verbal assurance and that too, the petitioner never appointed the said respondent
No. 2/ complainant as his agent or assistant for any purpose of work.
         The petitioner has brought to the notice of the Court that he on 28.01.2014
filed a complaint under Section 107 Cr.P.C.      before the Executive Magistrate at
Hailakandi for keeping peace and security against the witnesses of the
complainant/respondent No. 2 as they made illegal demand of money from him on
behalf of the complainant/respondent No. 2, which was registered as Case No.
2914/2014 under Section 107 Cr.P.C. before the Executive Magistrate, Hailakandi
wherein the learned Magistrate being satisfied drawn up the proceeding under the
said Section of Cr.P.C. against the witnesses of the respondent No. 2 and issued
show cause notice to them as to why they shall not be asked to execute bond of
Rs.1,000/- each for keeping peace and to maintain good behavior with the
petitioner. The petitioner also placed that said fact has also been reflected in the
said complaint/FIR of the respondent No. 2.
         It is seen that at the respondent 2 as complainant preferred the complaint
being CR Case No. 409C/2014 only on 29.04.2014, which was subsequently
registered as Lala P.S. Case No. 124/2014 under Sections 420/406 IPC
corresponding to GR No. 606/2014. The prayer of the complainant/respondent 2 in
his said complaint dated 29.04.2014 was for taking necessary action to recover the
amount from the petitioner with the help of police personnel of Lala Police Station,
which is unpaid by the petitioner to his the witness Nos. 1 and 2, who are very
simple person.
         The essential ingredients of Section 406 IPC is that there should be (i)
entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property, (ii) the
person so entrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriated or converted such entrusted
property or the property over which he/she has any dominion (a) to his own use or
(b) dishonestly used or dispose of that property or willfully suffering any other
person in violation (i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such
Crl. Ptn. No. 890 of 2014                                                  Page 3 of 5

trust was to be discharged        or (ii) of any legal contract made touching the
discharge of such trusts.
         To bring home the offence under Section 406 IPC, the ingredients of
entrustment with property, having domain over it, and the same having been
misappropriated or converted to his own use by the accused person are required to
be proved and that where the prosecution for the offence under Section 406 IPC
cannot bring the evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond doubt such
accused needs to be acquitted.
         On the other hand the essential ingredients Section 420 IPC are that (i)
there must be deception, i.e. the accused must have deceived someone, (ii) that by
the said deception, the accused must have induced a person – (a) to deliver any
property; or (b) to make, alter or destroy the whole or part of the valuable security
or anything which is signed or sealed and which is capable of being converted into
a valuable property and (iii) that the accused did so dishonestly.
         For a person to be convicted under Section 420 IPC, it has to be established
not only that he has cheated someone but also that by doing so, the accused has
dishonestly induced the person who was cheated to delivery any property.
         In the present case, from the reading of said complaint/FIR dated
29.05.2014 of the of the complainant/informant/Respondent No. 2 it can be seen
that it does not contain any such ingredients either of Section 406 or 420 IPC,
rather it is the informant/respondent No. 2 wants his share of profit allegedly from
the petitioner/accused. In said Complaint/FIR dated 29.05.2014, the complainant,
except the verbal agreement, did not state anything regarding any entrustment of
property by him on the petitioner over which he had the domain or that the
petitioner deceived or cheated him or someone by dishonest inducement to make
delivery any property, thereby the petitioner misappropriated or converted the
same to his own use. For any realization of amount as per an agreement between
him and the petitioner, the complainant/informant/respondent No. 2 is required to
establish the same against the petitioner by leading evidence before a Civil Court
and not by recourse to any criminal proceeding that too in the absence any such
material or ingredients of penal section.
Crl. Ptn. No. 890 of 2014                                                  Page 4 of 5

         For the reasons above the Court is of the view if the proceeding of said Lala
P.S. Case No. 124/2014 under Sections 420/406 IPC corresponding to GR No.
606/2014 is allowed to proceed against the petitioner, it would be an abuse of
process of the court and as such, for the ends of justice the proceeding of said Lala
P.S. Case No. 124/2014 corresponding to GR No. 606/2014 against the petitioner
herein is hereby set aside and quashed. Consequently the criminal complaint
lodged by the complainant/informant/respondent No.2 on 29.04.2014 before the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hailakandi being CR Case No. 409C/2014 against
the petitioner is also set aside and quashed.
         Accordingly this criminal petition stands allowed.
