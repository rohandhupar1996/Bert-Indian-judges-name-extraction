                     JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
        Heard Mr. S. Chamaria, the learned counsel for the petitioner.
2.      By filing this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India, the petitioner has challenged the order dated 27.03.2017 passed by
the learned Debts Recovery Tribunal, Guwahati in O.A. No.91/2017. By the
said order, while notice of the application was issued to the petitioner, the
learned Tribunal, as an interim measure, directed the defendants including
the   petitioner   herein  to    disclose   their  movable    and  immovable

properties/assets owned by them and further restraining them from
transferring, alienating or disposing or otherwise dealing with any part of
the properties/assets mentioned in Schedule-B thereof.
3.        The learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to 3 sanction
letters dated 08.03.2012, 17.12.2012 and 15.07.2013 to project that
initially a loan of Rs.1.5 Crore was availed by offering full security which is
mentioned in the said sanction letters and subsequently, loan was
enhanced to Rs.1.9 Crore and corresponding security was also enhanced
and the properties and securities are valued at Rs.2.5 Crore and the loan
was enhanced to Rs.2.87 Crore and the other book debts, stocks etc. which
were given as security was valued at Rs.1.87 Crore. It is submitted that
while filing an application, the application/Bank had projected that the
estimated value of the secured assets of Rs.1,56,98,700/-, which is
arbitrary and contrary to their own sanctioned letters.            It is further
submitted that along with the movable properties offered as security,
stocks and trade were also hypothecated, which also should have some
value and the photocopy of ledger statements were time to time furnished
to the Bank. It is projected that in view of above, the securities available
with the respondent /Bank is estimated more than the loan amount and
therefore, by portraying an incorrect picture, showing lower estimate value
of the properties, the respondent/Bank had managed to obtain the interim
order from the learned Debts Recovery Tribunal, Guwahati on 27.03.2017.
4.        The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied in the case of Sneh
Gupta vs. Devi Sarup & others, 2009(6) SCC 194. In paragraph-33 thereof
on which the learned counsel for the petitioner had relied on the same is
quoted below:
                 ”33. The High Court moreover was exercising its jurisdiction
                 under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. While
                 exercising the said jurisdiction, the High Court had a limited
                 role to play. It is not the function of the High court while

                exercising its supervisory jurisdiction to enter into the
                disputed question of fact. It has not been found by the High
                Court that the findings arrived at by the learned Additional
                District Judge were perverse and/ or in arriving the said
                findings, the learned Additional District Judge failed and/ or
                neglected to take into consideration the relevant factors or
                based its decision on irrelevant factors not germane
                therefor. It could intervene, if there existed an error
                apparent on the face of the record or, if any other well
                known principle of judicial review was found to be
                applicable.”
5.      The learned counsel of the petitioner also placed reliance in the
case of L&T Finance Ltd. Vs. Arup Kumar Bera & another reported in AIR
2014 KOL 78 to project that if the order passed by the subordinate court/
Tribunal is perverse and arrived at without taking into consideration the
irrelevant factors and has not considered the relevant factors, High Court
does have the power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to
exercise the power of judicial review against the order passed by the
learned Tribunal. It is submitted that as the valuation of property as
described in the sanction letters were a part of the O.A., the learned
Tribunal committed jurisdictional error, without going through the records
and without hearing the petitioner, in passing the interim order.
6.      This Court finds on perusal of the contents of both the judgments
cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner. In both the cases, there is a
one common factor that the order in challenge were passed on the findings
arrived at by the courts below. However, in the present case in hand, the
interim order which was passed, cannot be said to be findings arrived at
finally by the learned Tribunal. It is seen that the learned Tribunal does
have the jurisdiction under Section 19(18) of the Recovery of Debts Due to
Banks and Financial Institution Act, 1993 to pass an interim order.
CRP (I/O) No.162/2017                                             Page 3 of 5

Therefore, in the opinion of this Court, both the cases cited by the learned
counsel for the petitioner is distinguishable on facts.      As in the present
case, no finding was arrived at by the learned Tribunal so as to cause any
prejudice to the petitioner herein.
7.      It is also submitted by referring to the Entries in the relevant
Column No.3(a) of the O.A., it is the admitted case of the respondent/Bank
that Column Nos.(iv)(v) thereto does not show that the assets held by the
petitioner was not sufficient to cover the total claim and the learned
Tribunal did not consider the said facts before passing an order for
disclosure of their movable and immovable properties.
8.      Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, it appears that
while issuing summons, an order of interim nature has been issued by the
learned Tribunal to the effect that– (1) the defendants were directed to
disclose their movable and immovable properties/assets, and (2) the
defendants have been restrained from alienating, transferring or otherwise
dealing with any part of the assets mentioned in the Schedule-B. This Court
is of the view that under Section 19(18) of the Recovery of Debts Due to
Banks and Financial Institution Act, 1993, the learned Debts Recovery
Tribunal   has   the   jurisdiction  to  pass   interim   order.     Moreover,
notwithstanding the fact that under Section 18 of the said Act, this Court
has the power to exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India in relation to the matters specified in Section 17 of the
said Act. Nonetheless, the said Act also provides for alternative efficacious
remedy by way of filing an appeal under the said Act. As this Court finds
that there was a injunction against transferring of assets, the second part
of the impugned order restraining transferring of assets, which is to
prevent unauthorized transfer of the secured assets. Therefore, this is not
found to be a fit case for admitting this application as the said order is
appealable.

9.      However, this Court is inclined to accept the submissions made by
the learned counsel for the petitioner insofar the interim order which
relates to direction for the disclosure of movable or immovable properties,
which was passed in the impugned order on the ground that as per the
contents of the sanction letters, the value of the immovable properties
appears to be more than the claim amount. However, while declining to
interfere with the impugned order, this Court is inclined to grant liberty to
the petitioner to move the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Guwahati, in respect
of the direction for disclosure of movable or immovable properties, by filing
an appropriate application before the said Tribunal for recalling or review of
the said direction. Needless to say that the petitioner shall be entitled to
move the said Tribunal for suspension or modification of the order of
disclosure of movable or immovable properties/assets and in the event, if
such an application is moved before the Tribunal, the said learned Debts
Recovery Tribunal, Guwahati, will hear and dispose of the matter in
accordance with law.
10.     With the above observation and direction, this petition stands
closed.
                                                                     JUDGE

        Also heard Mr. D. Doley, the learned State counsel, who submits
that by the order dated 12.05.2017, this Court has ordered for striking out
the name of the respondent No.1/State. But it appears that the office has
not yet done the needful. In view of the order passed on 12.05.2017, the
learned State counsel is exempted from appearing in the matter.
        The learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the office
note dated 17.07.2017 indicating that the addressee could not be found. It
appears that the process server has visited the address of the respondent,
which appears to be correct address as given in the petition for divorce
before the court below being F.C© No.980/2016.
        Moreover, by the order dated 12.05.2017, the said proceeding
which was pending before the learned Family Court, Kamrup, Guwahati
was stayed. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the respondent is
avoiding service despite the knowledge of the present proceeding. Hence,
the notice issued on the respondent is deemed to be duly served.
        However, for the ends of justice, the matter be placed before the
Lawazima Court for appropriate order as regards service of notice on the
respondent affected by registered post.
