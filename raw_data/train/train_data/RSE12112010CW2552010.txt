        in the Digest?
RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.
1.      The petitioner(s) in each of the writ petitions claim to be having their
properties abutting the Chand Nagar Punjabi Market Road. The petitioner in
WP(C) No.2763/2010 is an Association of Shopkeepers who claim to be
having their shops abutting the said road. In each of the petitions, the relief
claimed is of declaration that the action by the respondent MCD of
demolition of properties / part properties of the petitioners while widening
the said road is illegal, in violation of due process of law and in defiance of
the constitutional and other rights of the petitioners to their properties. The
petitioners have also sought compensation and to restrain the respondent
MCD from carrying out further demolition of their properties in the garb of
road widening.
2.      Notice of the petitions was issued and the matters adjourned from
time to time for the respondent MCD to file counter affidavits. No counter
affidavit has been filed by the respondent MCD till now. When the matters
came up before this Court yesterday, there was again a request by the
respondent MCD for time for filing counter affidavits.                          However, the
matters being at the show cause notice stage and this Court being of the
prima facie opinion that the petitions were not maintainable, the counsels
were heard yesterday and two questions were posed to the counsels for the
petitioners i.e. firstly, as to how in the writ jurisdiction it can be decided as
to whether the demolition by the respondent MCD of the portions of the
WP(C)Nos.11218/09,13343/09,10/10,255/10, 2763/10 & Cont. Case(C) No.143/2010        Page 3 of 10

properties of the petitioners was illegal i.e. whether the properties
demolition whereof has been carried out are on private land as contended by
the petitioners or on public land as appeared to be the case of the respondent
MCD; secondly, since it appeared from the record that the respondent MCD
was carrying out the works aforesaid of road widening, and in removal of
encroachments thereupon resulting into demolition of the properties of the
petitioners, in pursuance to orders of the Division Bench of this Court in
WP(C) No.23136/2005, filed in Public Interest and in Contempt Case
No.649/2009 arising from orders in the said Public Interest Litigation, it was
enquired how these writ petitions, the relief wherein was to stop the
respondent MCD from carrying out the said works were maintainable.
3.      The counsels for the petitioners had contended yesterday that there
were admissions of the respondent MCD and otherwise borne out from the
record that the properties demolished for road widening were over private
land of the petitioners and were not over public land. The counsels had
yesterday sought time to demonstrate the same to this Court.
4.      Though the counsels for the petitioners have been heard for long
today but in my opinion neither of the writ petitioners has been able to make
out a case of it being borne out from the record and being undisputed that
the land which has been taken over for road widening by removal of
encroachment and demolition, is the private land of the petitioners.
5.      Before proceeding to consider the arguments of the counsel for writ
petitioners in WP(C) Nos.11218/2009, 13343/2009, 10/2010, 255/2010 and
the counsel for the writ petitioners in WP(C) No.2763/2010 in this respect, it
is also relevant to point out that no interim relief had been granted to the
petitioners in these petitions. The writ petitioner in WP(C) Nos. 11218/2009,
13343/2009, 10/2010 & 255/2010 had preferred intra-court appeals against
the order dated 8th April, 2010 in these proceedings. The said appeals being
WP(C)Nos.11218/09,13343/09,10/10,255/10, 2763/10 & Cont. Case(C) No.143/2010 Page 4 of 10

LPA Nos.339/2010, 406/2010 & 335/2010 were disposed of vide common
order dated 3rd June, 2010 of the Division Bench. No interim relief was
granted to the petitioners by the Division Bench also.                       However, the
Division Bench did hold that if this Bench eventually finds that there has
been unauthorized demolition, this Bench would grant appropriate equitable
reliefs to the petitioners; it was also observed that in that case, the works of
construction done by the respondent MCD after removal of encroachment /
demolition would not create any equity in favour of the petitioners.
6.      The counsels for the petitioners on the basis of the aforesaid
observations of the Division Bench as well as on the basis of certain
observations in the various orders filed in the Public Interest Litigation and
in the contempt case arising therefrom, argued that the Division Bench has
directed this Bench to determine the question as to whether the demolition
was legal or illegal and whether the land taken over for road widening is of
the petitioners or public land and thus this Bench cannot dispose of the writ
petitions by holding the same to be entailing disputed questions of fact. I do
not find any merit in the said contention of the petitioners. The observations
have been made without going into the question as to whether the writ
petitions are maintainable or not. In writ jurisdiction, disputed questions of
fact cannot be adjudicated. Merely because the Division Bench in the intra-
court appeal arising from these writ petitions or in the Public Interest
Litigation observed that the petitioners shall be entitled to file a writ petition
for assertion of their rights would not change the said principle and would
not allow something to be done in these proceedings which is impermissible
to be done in writ jurisdiction. Thus the petitions would be maintainable
only upon the petitioners establishing that no investigation of facts is
required. Else the remedy of the petitioners is by way of proving before the
fora competent to record evidence that the land in fact is theirs.
WP(C)Nos.11218/09,13343/09,10/10,255/10, 2763/10 & Cont. Case(C) No.143/2010     Page 5 of 10

7.      During the course of hearing none of the petitioners have filed any
documents of their own title to the property and from which it could be
shown that the land which has been taken over for road widening is of the
writ petitioners or that the writ petitioners have title thereto.
8.      Mr. Anil Kumar Gupta, Advocate has drawn attention to the reply
dated 18th November, 2009 received to the Right to Information (RTI) query
by the petitioner Joginder Kaur in WP(C) No.11218/2009. In the said reply,
it was explained to the representative of Joginder Kaur that the entire road
widening is on the opposite side i.e. towards Ganga Ram Vatika etc. and that
the plots in Vishnu Garden Group of Colonies are not affected under 60 feet
wide road widening as per regularization plan of Vishnu Garden. It may be
stated that while the petitioners in WP(C) Nos. 11218/2009, 13343/2009,
10/2010 & 255/2010 claim their properties to be on the Northern side of the
road, the members of the writ petitioner in WP(C) No.2763/2010 claim their
shops to be on the Southern side of the road. Mr. Anil Kumar Gupta,
Advocate contends that reply to the RTI query shows that the road widening
is to be on the Southern side and not on the Northern side.
9.      I do not have before us the RTI query in response to which the reply
aforesaid has been given. Moreover, the query is relating to widening of the
road to the extent of 60 feet. The Division Bench of this Court in Public
Interest Litigation aforesaid has observed that though the Lieutenant
Governor had suggested widening of the road to 60 feet width but for such
widening private land would have to be acquired and thus directed widening
to the extent of 45 feet only.                    Thus, it cannot be said that the reply to the
RTI query takes the position beyond any pail of controversy.
10.     Mr. Anil Kumar Gupta, Advocate has next drawn attention to a Plan
filed as Annexure-P3 in WP(C) No.11218/2009 which is described as a
proposed Plan of regularization for the colonies. He has with reference to
WP(C)Nos.11218/09,13343/09,10/10,255/10, 2763/10 & Cont. Case(C) No.143/2010          Page 6 of 10

the property of one Bakshish Singh on the said Plan contended that the
respondent MCD had taken away a portion of the property of Bakshish
Singh also and where against the said Bakshish Singh had represented to the
Lieutenant Governor and in which proceedings portion of the property of the
Bakshish Singh was restored. However, the property of Bakshish Singh,
from the Plan aforesaid appears to be at a distance from the properties of
other petitioners. The property of Bakshish Singh is at a bend in the road.
Even if the argument of the petitioners were to be correct, the matter
requires investigation of facts.                      It is nobody‟s case that the road or its
widening is in a straight line so that it can be said that if portion of the
property of Bakshish Singh is restored, it necessarily means that the
properties of the petitioners along that line cannot be taken over or that part
of the land is private land. Moreover, the senior counsel for the respondent
MCD has handed over a copy of the order dated 22 nd August, 2007 in
Contempt Case No.375/2007 filed by the said Bakshish Singh and by which
order the contempt petition was dismissed with costs. Thus the said factor
also does not lead to the unequivocal inference of there being no disputed
questions of fact.
11.     Mr. Anil Kumar Gupta, Advocate has also drawn attention to the
reply of the respondent MCD in contempt case No.649/2009 (supra) and
with reference to the paragraph 4 of the Preliminary Submissions and
paragraphs 4 & 5 of the Reply on Merits argued that the respondent MCD
has admitted therein that the encroachments were on one side only. I do not
find any clarity from the said reply also.                                The senior counsel for the
respondent MCD has with reference to paragraph 14 of the said reply again
shown that the paras 4 & 5 are with reference to the widening to the extent
of 60 feet and not with reference to widening to the extent of 45 feet as has
been ordered by the Division Bench.
WP(C)Nos.11218/09,13343/09,10/10,255/10, 2763/10 & Cont. Case(C) No.143/2010                Page 7 of 10

12.     Mr. M. Tarique Siddiqui, Advocate for writ petitioner in WP(C)
No.2763/2010 has with reference to the status report dated 28th February,
2006 filed by the respondent MCD in the Public Interest Litigation and
particularly with reference to the Annexure thereto contended that the
properties of the members of the petitioner Association are not in
encroachment. He has with reference to the measurements given in Column
titled “Width” contended that the encroachment is on both sides of the road.
However, this is found to be a complete misreading of Column 4. Column 4
gives two widths as the width at the two ends of the plots and it does not
relate to the two sides of the road. It is inconceivable and not the case that
the plot of each person is on both sides of the road.
13.     He has next drawn attention to the plan submitted by the respondent
MCD along with the reply to CM No.13862/2009 in Contempt Case
No.649/2009. He states that from the said Plan, it is apparent that the
encroachment was on both sides of the road; that the widening was to be on
both sides of the road.                     The said Plan is again of no assistance in
determining as to to what extent the land on the two sides of the road was to
be taken.
14.       He has next invited attention to the review application being CM
No.123/2007 filed by certain persons claiming properties on the Northern
side of the road, in the Public Interest Litigation. The said persons are not
before the Court and any statement by them in the said review application
cannot help this Court in determining the questions which arise for
consideration in the writ petition.
15.     He has lastly stated that the respondent MCD insofar as the properties
of the members of the petitioner Association are concerned had already
constructed the drain abutting the road and thus the alignment of the road
stood determined as on 7th September, 2009 and the subsequent action of the
WP(C)Nos.11218/09,13343/09,10/10,255/10, 2763/10 & Cont. Case(C) No.143/2010   Page 8 of 10

respondent MCD of taking yet further areas from the properties of the
members of the petitioner Association is illegal. It may be mentioned that
the petitioner in WP(C) No.2763/2010 was a respondent in the Public
Interest Litigation aforesaid. The senior counsel for the respondent MCD
has invited attention to the order dated 25th January, 2010 in contempt case
No.649/2009 vide which the similar prayer on behalf of the petitioner
Association was rejected and the works allowed to be proceeded.
16.     The questions raised by the petitioner are disputed questions of fact.
The identity of the land and the measurements thereof cannot be determined
in the exercise of writ jurisdiction. The remedy of the petitioners is by way
of a suit or demarcation proceedings in which alone all the said questions
can be gone into. I am therefore of the opinion that the writ remedy is
misconceived and no purpose will be served in keeping the present petitions
pending.
        As far as the second query raised is concerned, I am also of the
opinion that if a person is aggrieved of an order made in a legal proceedings,
his remedy is by way of applying in that legal proceedings only. The Public
Interest Litigant at whose instance the order of widening of the road was
made has not been impleaded as a party in neither of the petitions. That
litigant having obtained the orders in the Public Interest Litigation, the said
orders cannot be nullified by filing the petitions such as these. However, the
said observations should not be construed as disentitling the petitioners from
the relief in the alternative remedies suggested hereinabove. The Division
Bench had returned a finding of public land being available for widening of
the road to the extent of 45 feet width.                              The Division Bench had also
returned a finding of there being encroachments on the said public land as
well and passed order for removal thereof.                                   It would however be for
determination in the suit or demarcation proceedings, whether the properties

of the petitioners were within the said 45 feet, in which case they have been
rightly demolished for widening or beyond the said 45 feet.
17.     Mr. M. Tarique Siddiqui, Advocate has also stated that as per the
status report of the respondent MCD the road was of 30 feet wide only.
However, thereafter the Division Bench in the order dated 18th December,
2006 in the Public Interest Litigation in which the client of Mr. M. Tarique
Siddiqui, Advocate (petitioner Association in WP(C) No.2763/2010) was a
party, after considering the Survey Report has returned a positive finding
that there is encroachment over public land on which road to the extent of 45
feet wide could be extended. Thus there is no merit in the said contention
also.
18.     The counsel for the petitioner in Contempt Case No.143/2010 states
that the same does not survive. The same is dismissed as withdrawn.
19.     If the petitioners in the alternative remedy availed make out a case,
they will also have the right of restitution granted in LPAs aforesaid.
20.     The petitions are therefore dismissed with no order as to costs and
with liberty to the petitioners to seek appropriate remedies where the factual
controversies can be resolved.
        No order as to costs.

parties.
