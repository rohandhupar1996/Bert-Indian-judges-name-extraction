                                   JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
       This appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 has been
filed by the wife- Jyoti Bhuyan-challenging the legality and validity of the
impugned judgement and decree dated 25/6/2014 and 4/7/2014 respectively
passed by the Additional District Judge, Nagaon, in Title Suit (D) No. 35/2007,
dissolving the marriage between the parties and awarding permanent alimony
of   Rs.3,00,000/-      to  her     to  be    paid   within   4(four) months     by
respondent/husband-Narayan Deka.
                                                                       Page 1 of 3

2.     The brief facts are these. Appellant was married to the respondent on
3/5/2001 and they started to live together in the matrimonial home. The
respondent is an employee under Central Industrial Security Force and he was
posted in Uttar Pradesh. After about 40(forty) days of their marriage, on
18/6/2001 respondent had to leave for his place of posting leaving appellant
with his family members. But, appellant started treating his family members
rudely and on 25/7/2001 left for her maternal home on the false pretext of her
mother’s illness. When on 16/8/2001, respondent returned home and came to
know about desertion of his wife, he went to her parental home to bring her
back, but in vain. He was allegedly manhandled and threatened with dire
consequences on his refusal to stay in the house of his in-laws. He also sent his
brother to bring her back, but without any fruit. So, finding no alternative, he
had to file the suit for divorce.
3.     Appellant contested the suit denying the allegations levelled against her
and alleged that he and his family members used to demand dowry from her
and on her inability to satisfy their demands, they used to torture her. She was
even blamed for having illicit relationship with her own brother and when her
father visited her, respondent physically assaulted her and hence, she was
brought to her parental home by her brother. She then filed a case under
Section 498-A of Indian Penal Code and also filed a petition for maintenance.
4.     Both the parties adduced evidence and the District Judge decreed the
suit on contest vide the abovementioned impugned judgment and decree.
5.     Appellant has filed this appeal on very limited ground on the quantum of
permanent alimony only. Both the parties resided for about two (2) months as
husband and wife and there is no issue from the marriage either. Respondent
earns a salary of Rs. 18,935/- per month and the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- seems
to be sufficient. However, the learned counsel for the respondent has agreed to
pay an additional sum of Rs.1,00,000/- towards permanent alimony. After
hearing the learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, we are of
the considered view that a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- would be just, adequate and
                                                                      Page 2 of 3

proper alimony considering the social status and age of the parties vis-à-vis
monthly income of the respondent. The respondent has already paid
Rs.3,00,000/- to the appellant. He will now pay Rs.1,00,000/- to her within
60(sixty) days from today.
6.     Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to the above extent. The appeal is
partly allowed.
