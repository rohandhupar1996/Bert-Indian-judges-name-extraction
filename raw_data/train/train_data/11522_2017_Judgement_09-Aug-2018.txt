                       2.        This    appeal   by   special  leave  by   the
                       landlord is against the order dated 7th December,
                       2016  passed   by   the   Calcutta   High  Court   in  a
                       proceeding under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy
                       Act, 1997 (hereinafter referred as “the 1997 Act”)
                       for  eviction   of   the    respondent-tenant   on   the
                       ground that the tenant had defaulted in payment of
                       his share of municipal tax as an occupier under
                       the   provisions      of     the   Kolkata    Municipal
                       Corporation Act, 1980 (hereinafter referred to as
Signature Not Verified “the 1980 Act”).       The application filed by the

18:04:36 IST
Reason:                landlord was dismissed by the learned Trial Court

                                                    2
which view has been upheld in appeal by the High
Court.
3.   The matter lies in a very short compass and
the   question   arising   may   be  formulated  as
hereunder:
      “Whether after the amendment of the
      West Bengal premises Tenancy Act by
      Amendment Act No. 14 of 2001 with
      effect from 10th July, 2001 [which had
      incorporated     sub-section   (8)    to
      Section 5] whether a tenant who
      defaults in payment of his/her share
      of municipal tax as apportioned by the
      landlord would be in default of rent
      rendering him/her liable to eviction.”
4.   The rent agreement governing the parties in
the present case was executed in the year 1991.
Under the said agreement the parties had agreed
that the rent would include all municipal taxes
payable  and   that  as  and  when  such  taxes are
enhanced rent should be proportionately raised.
However, with the amendment of the Act with effect
from 10th July, 2001 and after incorporation of
sub-section (8) of Section 5 the obligation to pay
the municipal tax/taxes was specifically cast on
the tenant in his/her capacity as an occupier.
Sub-Section (8) of Section 5 is in the following

                                                              3
terms:
      “5. Obligations of tenant.-
                   ***          ***               ***
                   ***          ***               ***
      (8)Every tenant shall pay his share of
      municipal tax as an occupier of the
      premises      in     accordance        with    the
      provisions of the Kolkata Municipal
      Corporation Act, 1980 (West Bengal Act
      LIX     of   1980)     or    the    West    Bengal
      Municipal Act, 1993 (West Bengal Act
      XXII of 1993).
5.           In the present case, the property tax
payable   in     respect    of   the   suit     property  was
reassessed      and    enhanced.     There     were   several
tenants in occupation of the suit property.               The
landlord apportioned the tax between the tenants
and issued a notice dated 7th February, 2003 upon
the  respondent-tenant        to   pay   his   share   of the
municipal taxes.        The respondent-tenant by reply
dated   29th   March,    2003   to   the   said   notice  had
sought for a reconsideration/review of the matter
on  a    “co-operative       spirit    for     the   sake  of
harmonious      relation between tenant and landlord.”
As  the   respondent-tenant        had    not   remitted  the
amount due as his share of the municipal tax, the
landlord instituted the proceedings for eviction

                                                           4
on the ground of default of payment of rent on the
part of the respondent-tenant.
6.         The learned Trial Court dismissed the
claim   of  the   landlord    on   the   ground  that   no
documentary      evidence     with     regard    to    the
enhancement of property tax was forthcoming and as
the   respondent-tenant     had   been    depositing   the
monthly rent payable with the Rent Controller, the
tenant cannot be deemed to be the defaulter.
7.         In   appeal,   the   High   Court  upheld   the
order   of  the   learned   Trial   Court   though   on  a
different reasoning.       The High Court held that
even if the municipal taxes are to be held to be
part of the rent payable, there is no automatic
enhancement of the rent by an unilateral notice on
the part of the landlord under Section 20 of the
1997   Act  and   that  such   enhancement    has   to  be
ordered by the Rent Controller. As the aforesaid
requirement was not met, the High Court dismissed
the appeal filed by the landlord.
8.         In the present case, under the tenancy
agreement   municipal   taxes    were   included   in  the
monthly rent payable and any enhancement thereof

                                                   5
was to result in enhancement of the monthly rent
also. With the amendment made to the Act with
effect from 10th July, 2001 and upon incorporation
of sub-section (8) of Section 5, the obligation to
pay municipal taxes as an occupier of the premises
fell upon the tenant. The relevant clauses in the
rent agreement therefore stood superseded by the
statutory obligation cast on the tenant by the
amendment to the Act.
9.        In  the    present   case following  the
enhancement of municipal taxes by the Municipal
Corporation in respect of the suit property an
apportionment of the share of each tenant was made
by the landlord and a notice to pay was served on
the respondent-tenant. As already noticed, in his
reply, the respondent-tenant did not dispute his
liability to pay his share of the municipal tax
and had sought for a reconsideration/review.    In
the written statement apart from an evasive denial
in the following terms there was no other denial
or dispute raised:
     “7…………The defendant further denies the
     legitimacy and/or authenticity of the
     calculation    with    regard  to    the
     enhancement of the rent…..”

                                                                         6
              10.         The respondent-tenant nowhere denied in
              any specific terms that the share of municipal
              taxes demanded was disproportionate or excessive
              or   otherwise    unauthorized    in   law.  The  argument
              advanced    at   the   bar  that    the   landlord  cannot
              apportion    the    municipal    taxes   among   different
              tenants if the premises is to be occupied by more
              than    one    tenant    and    it    is   the   Municipal
              Corporation    who   is  the   authority    to  separately
              assess the tax payable by each tenant does not
              find any support from the provisions of the 1980
              Act.
              11.         This aspect of the matter came up for
              consideration      before    this    Court   in   Calcutta
              Gujarati     Education     Society     and   another   vs.
              Calcutta    Municipal    Corpn.    and   others1  and  the
              views expressed by this Court is found to be in
              paragraph 45 of the said report which is extracted
              below:
                      “45.      We find that the machinery
                      provisions for assessment and recovery
                      of tax basically involve the owner or
                      the lessor who is “primarily liable”
                      for the tax on property although in
1. (2003) 10 SCC 533

                                        7
the course of assessment and recovery
of portion of tax from the tenants,
sub-tenants   or    occupants,    their
involvement is also directed. It is
with the purpose to make the procedure
of recovery of tax simpler that the
owner or the lessor is proceeded
against as the “person primarily
liable”. The owner or lessor of the
property is “primarily” required to
satisfy the demand towards tax with
right to recover it from the tenant,
sub-tenant or the occupant. If the
landlord or the owner is obliged to
make payment of whole amount of tax
inclusive of his own share and share
of the tenant, sub-tenant or the
occupant, the owner or lessor has to
be conferred with the power to recover
the portion of tax payable by the
tenant, sub-tenant or occupant who is
actually enjoying the property and
putting it to use for commercial or
non-residential      purpose.       The
legislature has taken note of the fact
that a large number of properties in
the metropolitan city of Calcutta are
in occupation of tenants, sub-tenants
or occupants on a comparatively small
amount of rent or lease money. In such
a situation, to impose entire burden
of tax on the owner or lessor, would
be inequitable, more so when the
tenancy law does not allow increase in
rent beyond a particular limit and the
right of eviction of the landlord is
restricted to the grounds under the
Tenancy   Act.    By    the    impugned
provisions of the Act, therefore, the
legislature     has      thought     of
apportioning the tax burden between
owner or the lessor as one party and
the tenant, sub-tenant or occupier as
the other parties. The whole amount of
tax is recoverable from the lessor and
may also be recovered from the tenant

                                                         8
       or sub-tenant through attachment of
       the rent. In case where the lessor or
       landlord has paid the whole tax
       including the portion of tax payable
       by the tenant or sub-tenant, the
       landlord has to be equipped with the
       power to get himself reimbursed by
       recovery of the portion of tax paid by
       him on behalf of the tenant. Section
       231 of the Act, therefore, creates a
       fiction that the “tax” apportioned on
       the tenant would be treated as “rent”
       and would be recoverable as such. The
       word “rent” has not been defined in
       the tenancy law and this Court has
       taken note of this legal position in
       the case of Puspa Sen Gupta v. Susma
       Ghose (1990) 2 SCC 651 which arose out
       of the provisions of the Tenancy Act
       applicable to West Bengal. Rent is a
       compendious     expression    which    may
       include lease money with service
       charges for water, electricity and
       other taxes leviable on the tenanted
       premises.”         (underlining is ours)
     As   already   seen,   in  paragraph   45   of  the
report, extracted above, the provisions of Section
231 of the 1980 Act was also considered and it was
held that municipal taxes would be a part of the
“rent” payable by the tenant to the landlord.
12.        While   the  provisions   of  the   1980  Act
make   it    very    clear   that   an    occupier    as
distinguished     from   the    owner   i.e.     ‘person
primarily liable’ is entitled to pre-assessment
notice   and   to   participate   in   the   assessment

                                                     9
proceedings and also to question the same by way
of an appeal, etc. assessment of a part of the
premises in occupation of a tenant or different
parts of such premises in occupation of different
tenants is not contemplated under the 1980 Act.
Rather, from the provisions of Section 230 of the
1980  Act,   it is  clear  that  the  person  to  be
assessed to tax is the person primarily liable to
pay i.e. the owner who is vested with the right to
recover the portion of the tax paid by him on
behalf of the tenant, if required, proportionately
to the extent that the value of the area occupied
bears  to   the value  of  the  total  area  of  the
property. Under the 1980 Act, in the event of any
default on the part of the owner to pay the tax
the rent payable by the tenant(s) is liable to be
attached.
13.        In the present case, default on the part
of the respondent-tenant is clear and evident. The
obligation to pay municipal taxes on the tenant
being over and above the obligation to pay the
rent by virtue of the provisions of Section 5(8)
of the 1997 Act, the High Court could not have

                                                    10
imposed   on   the  landlord  the   requirement  of
obtaining a formal order of enhancement of rent
from the Rent Controller.
14.        For the aforesaid reasons, we allow this
appeal and set aside the order of the High Court
affirming the order of the learned Trial Court.
The application filed by the landlord for eviction
of the respondent-tenant is allowed.
