       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.P.GARG
S.P.GARG, J.
1.           Present petitions have been preferred by the petitioners under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. to challenge the legality and correctness of an order
dated 26.03.2012 of learned Special Judge, CBI by which charges under
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                            Page 1 of 13

Section 120B read with Section 174A IPC and Section 174A IPC were
framed against them. The petitions are contested by the respondents.
2.            I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have
examined the file. It is not in dispute that the petitioners along with others
are    facing   trial  in   a    case  registered vide    FIR    bearing       RC
No.DAI/2010/A/044 registered under Sections 120B/420 IPC and Section
13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act.
3.            Admittedly, FIR was lodged on 29.11.2010 on the basis of
‘source information’. The petitioners were arrayed as accused No.7 and 8
respectively. By an order dated 23.05.2011, learned Special Judge took
cognizance of the aforesaid offences. It is urged that instead of issuing
summons or warrants under Section 204 Cr.P.C. for appearance of the
petitioners, the Trial Court straight away issued proclamation under Section
82 Cr.PC. on the basis of report on the warrants procured by the
Investigating Agency. The proclamation required the petitioners to appear
on 14.07.2011 at 10.00 a.m.
4.            On 14.07.2011, the petitioners did not appear personally due to
pendency of anticipatory bail before this Court. They appeared through
advocate before the Trial Court who filed an undertaking as desired by the
Court to appear within 5 – 6 working days after the disposal of the
anticipatory bail application on 15.07.2011.
5.            It is averred that on 21.07.2011 the learned Special Judge
without cogent reasons rejected the ‘undertaking’ furnished by the
petitioners despite pendency of anticipatory bail petition. After recording
statement of the process server regarding execution of the process under
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                            Page 2 of 13

Section 82 Cr.P.C., the Trial Court issued order of attachment of immovable
properties.
6.           The petitioners approached this Court for quashing of the
process issued under Section 82 Cr.P.C. vide Crl.M.C.2136/2011 and also
moved bail applications No. 885/2011 and 882/2011           respectively for
anticipatory bail. Both were dismissed vide orders dated 02.08.2011. SLP
(Crl.) Nos. 5991/2011 and 5989/2011 were dismissed as ‘withdrawn’ on
11.08.2011.
7.           Undisputedly, the petitioners surrendered on 16.08.2011 before
the learned Special Judge and were sent to judicial custody. On 18.08.2011,
the petitioners were remanded to police custody for five days.
Subsequently, they were lodged to judicial custody. The petitioners have
since been granted bail in the main case i.e. CC No.22/11 on 23.01.2012. In
CC No.24/11 relating to Section 174A read with Section 120B IPC, the
petitioners were admitted to bail on 16.02.2012.
8.           On 08.11.2011, CBI filed supplementary charge-sheet under
Section 174A read with Section 120B IPC in the main case i.e. CC No.22/11
and the impugned charge was framed therein. Learned counsel for the
petitioners urged that the CBI Court had no jurisdiction to issue process
under Sections 82/83 Cr.P.C. as they had put appearance before the Trial
Court through counsel and had furnished the required ‘undertaking’.
Proclamation as envisaged under Section 82 Cr.P.C. did not specifically
require ‘personal appearance of the petitioners on the date and time
mentioned therein.’ Appearance through their counsel was due compliance
of the proclamation issued under Section 82 Cr.P.C. Moreover, petitioners’
applications under Section 438 Cr.P.C. for seeking anticipatory bail was
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                          Page 3 of 13

pending consideration before this Court; they could not have been deprived
of their fundamental right to seek legal remedies. There was no intentional
default on behalf of the petitioners to put appearance before the Trial Court
and it was due to sufficient and valid reasons.
9.            Learned counsel further urged that CBI Court had no
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the charge-sheet filed under Section 174A
IPC; CBI had no jurisdiction or power or authority to investigate an offence
under Section 174A IPC. CBI Court has erroneously taken cognizance of
offence under Section 174A IPC, though it was not a part of the main
charge-sheet. As per Schedule under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973
offence under Section 174A IPC is exclusively triable by the Court of
Magistrate. Offence under Section 174A IPC even does not fall within the
three categories of cases referred to Sections 3 & 4 of the PC Act. Section
195 Cr.P.C. prescribes that no Court can take cognizance of any offence
punishable under Sections 174 to 188 IPC (Both inclusive) without a
complaint in writing. No such complaint was filed by a public servant.
10.           Learned counsel further urged that order on charge cannot be
sustained for the aforesaid reasons. The petitioner had not avoided
appearance before the Trial Court deliberately and it was due to compelling
circumstances beyond their control. Applications moved before the Trial
Court for seeking personal exemption through counsel were declined.
11.           Reliance has been placed on the authorities ‘State of Gujarat &
Ors vs. Dilipbhai Nathjibhai Patel & Anr.’, AIR 1998 SC 1429; ‘M/s.Oswal
Pressure Die Casting Industry, Faridabad vs. Presiding Officer & Anr.’,
AIR 1998 SC 1431.
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                            Page 4 of 13

12.          Learned Standing Counsel controverting the contentions urged
that the petitioners had deliberately avoided to appear before the
Investigating Agency and were rightly declared Proclaimed Offender by
following due process. Since the petitioners were declared Proclaimed
Offender, prima facie, they are liable to be convicted for committing offence
under Section 174A IPC.         Reliance has been placed on the authorities
‘Maneesh Goomer vs. State’, 2012(1)JCC 465; ‘Kamlesh Kumar & Ors. Vs.
State of Jharkhand & Ors.’, 2013 (15) SCC 460.
13.          Undisputedly, the petitioners did not put appearance before the
Trial Court despite issuance of non-bailable warrants. No cogent document
has emerged on record to infer if the petitioners were prevented by
compelling reasons not to appear personally before the Trial Court on
various dates. During this period, the petitioners availed various other legal
remedies but did not opt to appear in compliance of the process issued by the
Trial Court. Finally, the Investigating Agency was forced to move the CBI
Court to get Non-Bailable Warrants against them to procure their presence.
Even issuance of Non-Bailable Warrants had no impact upon the petitioners
and they avoided their appearance in person. Instead of putting personal
appearance, their counsel put appearance and prayed for five or six working
days to put appearance after the disposal of their anticipatory bail
applications. The undertakings furnished on 15.07.2011 by the petitioners
show that they were very much available but opted not to appear before the
Court. Furnishing the undertakings to appear after five or six days of the
disposal of the anticipatory bail applications was not due compliance of the
directions to appear personally before the Court. It is relevant to note that
even after dismissal of their anticipatory bail applications, the petitioners
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                           Page 5 of 13

avoided to appear. Only when they exhausted all their remedies up to the
Apex Court, they surrendered before the Trial Court on 16.08.2011.
14.          It is a matter of record that the petitioners had filed
Crl.M.C.2136/2011 to quash the process issued under Section 82 Cr.P.C.
By a detailed order dated 02.08.2011 the said petition was dismissed. This
Court observed that the Trial Court was within its jurisdiction to proclaim
them as absconders under Section 82 Cr.P.C. after their non-appearance
pursuant to the issuance of Non-Bailable Warrants. The petitioners cannot
be permitted to re-agitate all these issues. It is relevant to note that the bail
applications No. 885/2011 and 882/2011 field by the petitioners respectively
came to be dismissed by this Court by an order dated 02.08.2011. These
orders were challenged by the petitioners by filing SLP (Crl.)
Nos.5991/2011 and 5989/2011 (Annexure ‘P-9’) respectively.                     The
petitioners further opted to withdraw the petitions praying that the
applications under Section 439 Cr.P.C. to be filed be directed to be disposed
of immediately. Needless to say, when the petitioners failed to avail any
relief whatsoever, they surrendered before the Court on 16.08.2011. They
remained in CBI custody till 23.08.2011.            Since the petitioners had
deliberately avoided to appear before the Trial Court and despite rejection of
their applications seeking personal exemption they did not bother to appear,
issuance of process under Section 82 Cr.P.C. cannot be faulted.
15.          Relying on ‘State of U.P. and others vs. Sushil Kumar Katiyar’,
MANU/UP/0252/16 decided on 19.02.2016, learned counsel for the
petitioner urged that Section 195 Cr.P.C. clearly barred the Court from
taking cognizance of any offences punishable under Sections 172 to 188
IPC. Provision of Section 195 Cr.P.C. is mandatory and the Court has no
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                              Page 6 of 13

jurisdiction to take cognizance of any offence mentioned therein unless there
is a complaint in writing by the public servant.
16.           At the outset, it may be mentioned that proceedings in ‘State of
U.P. and others vs. Sushil Kuamr Katiyar’ (Supra) were quashed on various
grounds where the Court below had not discussed as to how the Court was
satisfied that the offence under Section 174A IPC was made out; when the
process under Section 82 Cr.P.C. was issued and on which date, he had to
appear and whether after the attachment of immovable properties, the
proceedings of the criminal case under Section 174A IPC could be
continued. Moreover, the respondent therein had already been discharged
from the scheduled offences. It was observed that permission to continue
with the proceedings of criminal case under Section 174A IPC would only
amount to his harassment which was not the intention of the legislature. It is
not the case in the instant petitions as the petitioners are facing trial for
commission of serious offences.
17.           This Court in ‘Maneesh Goomer vs. State’, 2012(1)JCC 465
(Crl.M.C. 4208/2011) decided on 04.01.2012 has categorically held that
Section 195 Cr.P.C. has not been correspondingly amended so as to include
Section 174A IPC which was brought into the Penal Code with effect from
23.06.2006.
18.           Section 174A IPC was introduced in the Code with effect from
23.06.2006 and Section 195A Cr.P.C. which provides that no Court shall
take cognizance of offences punishable under Sections 172 to 188 IPC (Both
inclusive) or of the abetment of committing the offence, except by complaint
in writing by the public servant or of some other public servant to whom he
is administratively subordinate, was a part of the Criminal Procedure Code
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                           Page 7 of 13

since 1974 when the new Criminal Procedure Code came into force. No
corresponding amendment was brought into Section 195 (1) (a) in the year
2006 when a new offence, by adding Section 174A was introduced in Indian
Penal Code. By no stretch of imagination, it can be inferred or presumed
that Section 174A would be deemed to be included in between Section 172
to Section 188 IPC.
19.          This Court in ‘Maneesh Goomer vs. State’, 2012(1)JCC 465
held :
                    “....it may be noted that Section 174- A IPC
                    was introduced in the Code with effect from
                    23rd June, 2006. Section 195(1) Cr.P.C.
                    provides that no Court shall take cognizance
                    of offences punishable under Section 172 to
                    188 (both inclusive) of the IPC or of the
                    abatement, or attempt to commit the said
                    offences, except on the complaint in writing
                    of the public servant concerned or of some
                    other public servant to whom he is
                    administratively subordinate. Section 195
                    Cr.P.C. has not been correspondingly
                    amended so as to include Section 174-A IPC
                    which was brought into the Penal Code with
                    effect from 23rd June, 2006. The Legislature
                    was conscious of this fact and that is why
                    though all other offences under chapter X of
                    the Criminal Procedure Code are
                    noncognizable, offence punishable under
                    Section 174-A IPC is cognizable. Thus the
                    Police officer on a complaint under Section
                    174-A IPC is competent to register FIR and
                    after investigation thereon file a charge-sheet
                    before the Court of Magistrate who can take
                    cognizance thereon. Thus, I find no merit in
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                            Page 8 of 13

                    the contention raised by the Learned Counsel
                    for the Petitioner. ”
20.          This judgment has been followed in ‘Moti Singh Sikarwar vs.
State of U.P. and Ors’, MANU/UP/2481/2016, decided on 29.11.2016 by
the High Court of Allahabad. In the said judgment, it was observed that bar
created by Section 195 (1) (a) Cr.P.C. would not apply to the provisions of
section 174A IPC. It held:
                    “21. The reasons are as follows:
                    "1. It is to be noted that all the offences
                    under Section 172 to 188 I.P.C. (both
                    inclusive) are non-cognizable and bailable,
                    whereas Section 174-A I.P.C. which provides
                    for punishment upto 7 years imprisonment
                    and fine, in case the offender fails to appear
                    at the specified place and the specified time,
                    as required by the proclamation published
                    under Section 82 Cr.P.C., is cognizable and
                    non-bailable. The legislature was conscious
                    of this fact and that is why while introducing
                    Section 174-A in the I.P.C. in the year 2006,
                    it made no corresponding amendment in
                    Section 195 (1)(a) Cr.P.C. so as to include
                    Section 174-A I.P.C. in between all the non-
                    cognizable offences and bailable from
                    Sections 172 to 188 I.P.C.
                    2. It cannot be said that due to inadvertence,
                    the      corresponding        amendment      in
                    Section 195(1)(a) Cr.P.C., was left to be
                    made by the legislature. It is noteworthy that
                    Section 195 has         been    correspondingly
                    amended in the year 2006, by amending the
                    exception clause of it. Had there been any
                    intention on the part of the legislature to
                    include            Section 174-A I.P.C.      in
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                             Page 9 of 13

                    Section 195(1)(a) Cr.P.C. it would have
                    definitely         correspondingly     amended
                    Section 195(1)(a) Cr.P.C. also.
                    3. Section 154 of Code of Criminal
                    Procedure provides for information in
                    cognizable cases and the concept of "locus
                    standi" has been completely washed off by
                    this section, as any person can set the law
                    into motion, in case any cognizable offence is
                    noticed by him, by registering a first
                    information report. The public interest
                    demands that criminal justice should be swift
                    and sure and the court should not let the
                    guilty scot free only on the basis of mere
                    some technicalities. Section 460 Cr.P.C. is
                    also based on the same principle.
                    4. The basic principle of law is that one, who
                    seeks equity should do equity. In other words
                    the persons, who seeks equitable reliefs,
                    should come before the court with clean
                    hands. The accused has no right to choose
                    the mode by which he is to be prosecuted
                    specially in the circumstances when he has
                    failed to comply with the orders of the court
                    and is prolonging the matter by filing one
                    case after another.
                    5. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Maneesh
                    Goomer's case (supra) has held that
                    Section 195 Cr.P.C.         has    not     been
                    correspondingly amended so as to include
                    section 174-A I.P.C., which was brought into
                    the Penal Code with effect from 23rd June
                    2006 and there is no reason to deviate with
                    the view of Hon'ble Delhi High Court."
                    22. In view of the above discussion, this court
                    is of the considered view that the bar of
                    Section 195 (1)(a) Cr.P.C. is not applicable
                    to the present case and a private person is
CRL.REV.P.182/2012 & connected matter.                             Page 10 of 13

                    competent to lodge a complaint or even an
                    F.I.R. under Section 174-A I.P.C.”
21.          Bar of Section 195 (1) (a) Cr.P.C. is not applicable to the facts
and circumstances of this case.
22.          Placing reliance on Mohd.Jamal @ Ranjana Vs. State, Cr.A.
No. 391/2013 decided on 23.05.2013 by this Court, learned counsel for the
petitioner urged that CBI Court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the
offence under Section 174A IPC as it was triable by the Court of Magistrate.
It is not in dispute that Special Judge, CBI Court is a Court of original
criminal jurisdiction and exercises all the powers of a Magisterial Court.
Thus, cognizance taken for the offence under Section 174A IPC cannot be
faulted.
23.          In the present case, when the petitioners did not put appearance
deliberately and were declared absconders, supplementary charge-sheet for
commission of offence under Section 174A IPC was filed by the
Investigating Agency. Offence under Section 174A IPC, though independent
in nature is an off-shoot of the initial charge-sheet pending trial before the
CBI Court. No separate investigation is required to be conducted as the
orders of the Court declaring the petitioners to be Proclaimed Offenders are
part of the record in the main challan. Object and purpose to incorporate
Section 174A IPC primarily is to ensure that the accused / suspects do not
scuttle investigation or trial by remaining absconding without valid or
sufficient reasons.    In such a scenario, when the suspects or accused
abscond, possibility of valuable evidence to be washed away cannot be ruled
out. Since CBI had jurisdiction to investigate the main offence, cognizance

by the Court for commission of offence under Section 174A IPC, its fall out,
cannot be termed illegal or without jurisdiction.
24.           This Court in ‘State vs. Proclaimed Offenders of Delhi and
others’, Crl.No.2021/2010, decided on 11.08.2010 held that supplementary
charge-sheet under Section 174 IPC can be filed or the offence under
Section 174A IPC can be added in the main charge-sheet. Apparently, no
fresh investigation was required to be carried out.
25.           Well settled position is that a ‘case’ and a ‘counter-case’ one
triable exclusively by the Sessions Court and the other not triable
exclusively by the Court of Sessions can be tried by the Court of Sessions to
avoid conflicting judgments. In ‘Sudhir & Ors. Vs. State of MP’, 2001 (2)
SCC 688, it was categorically held that a Sessions Judge has the power to try
any offence under the Indian Penal Code.          It is not necessary for the
Sessions Court that the offence should be one exclusively triable by the
Courts of Sessions. This power of the Sessions Court can be discerned from
a reading of the Section 26 of the Code.
26.           Seeking analogy from the said judgment, it can well be inferred
that the offence under Section 174A IPC which arises out of the proceedings
conducted during the main case, can be tried and disposed of by the same
Court. Lodging of separate FIR for commission of offence under Section
174 IPC is not always required.
27.           Prima facie, there was sufficient and enough material before the
Court to proceed for commission of offence under Section 120B IPC read
with Section 174A IPC and Section 174A IPC. Arguments regarding due
procedure before declaring the petitioners ‘proclaimed offenders’ and
whether the petitioners were prevented by compelling circumstances and

there was no intentional default in non-appearance are all subject matter of
trial.
28.          In the light of above discussion, the petitions being devoid of
merits are dismissed.
29.          Observations in the order shall have no impact on merits of the
case.
