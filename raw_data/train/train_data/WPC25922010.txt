                  2.             The petitioner is the wife of Late Upendra Narayan Banikya
                  (hereinafter referred to as “the employee”) and the claim here is to allow
                  pension/family pension on account of the service rendered by the husband. On
                  1.3.1951 the employee entered service as an Assistant Teacher in the Bapuji
                  M.E. School at the venture stage. The school was provincialized w.e.f. 1.10.1977
                  and 5 months thereafter on 28.2.1978, the employee superannuated from
                  service.
                  3.             The retired employee died on 3.8.1989 without the benefit of
                  pension. His widow has however filed this case 22 years after the retirement of
                  the employee, to claim pension/family pension on account of her husband. The
                  respondents however resist the claim for pension by projecting the delay and
                  laches of the litigant. It is argued that during the lifetime of the employee, the
                  pension was never claimed by him and therefore after his death, his wife cannot
                  put forward any enforceable claim for pension/family pension, on account of the
                  employee.
                  4.             The Assam Elementary Education (Provincialization) Act, 1974
                  (hereinafter referred to as “the 1974 Act”) as originally enacted, did not provide
                  for pension for the employees of the provincialized schools. Subsequently
                  however, Section 4-A was inserted in the 1974 Act, whereby w.e.f. 10.4.1987,
                  the service of teachers and staff became pensionable. But it is noteworthy that
                  the employee in the present case retired on 28.2.1978 well before Section 4-A
                  was inserted, in the 1974 Act. But even under the amended provisions, only
                  those whose services were provincialized by 5.9.1975, were covered by the
                  amendment but here, the employee’s service was provincialized three years after
                  the appointed date when the Assam Elementary Education (Provincialization)
                  Rules 1977 (hereinafter referred to as “the 1977 Rules”) was given effect.
                  5.1            To justify the belated claim for pension, Mr. S. Haque, the learned
                  Counsel cites the Supreme Court’s judgment in Assam Madhyamik Sikshak Aru
                  Karmachari Santha vs. State of Assam and Others reported in (1996) 9 SCC 186.
                  This case before the Supreme Court was of teachers covered by the Assam
                  Secondary Education (Provincialization) Act, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as “the
WP(c) No.2592/2010
                                                                                Page 2 of 4

                                                           3
                  Secondary Education Act”) unlike the petitioner’s husband, who was a teacher of
                  a middle school. Therefore automatic application of the ratio in Assam
                  Madhyamik Sikshak Aru Karmachari Santha (supra) may not be justified here as
                  the litigants were different and were covered by distinctive Rules.
                  5.2             Moreover, the employee here was born on 28.2.1918 and since
                  the superannuation age is 58 years for M.E. School teachers, he should have
                  been made to retire on 28.2.1976. Instead the employee continued to serve 2
                  extra years until 28.2.1978 and retired at the age of 60 years. Had he retired on
                  28.2.1976, the husband’s service would not be provincialized since the ME school
                  was taken over by the Government, only on 1.10.1877.
                  5.3             Nevertheless for those who served beyond the superannuation
                  age, the Supreme Court while dealing with the teachers of Secondary Schools
                  observed that, those who served beyond 58 years and have withdrawn their CPF
                  dues on retirement, can re-deposit the CPF amount in order to claim pensionary
                  benefits, as applicable to Government employees, who should retire at 58 years.
                  5.4             But it cannot be overlooked that the petitioner’s husband is not
                  governed by the Secondary Education Act. But nevertheless, if we apply the ratio
                  of Assam Madhyamik Sikshak Aru Karmachari Santha (supra) on the pension
                  claim, re-deposit of the CPF dues should have been opted by the employee. But
                  unfortunately the employee never opted to receive pension when he retired on
                  28.2.1978 by offering to re-deposit the CPF contribution, received by him.
                  6.              The petitioner’s husband, during his lifetime, never put forward
                  any claim for pension nor he had agitated his grievance, before any Court. Now
                  32 years after the retirement of the employee and 22 years after his death, his
                  widow has filed this case to claim pension/family pension and in my considered
                  view, such belated claim should surely be construed as opportunistic and not
                  reasonable.
                  7.              Under the applicable norms, the employee should have been
                  retired at the age of 58 years on 28.2.1976 but he served 2 years extra and he
                  retired at the age of 60 years on 28.2.1978. Theoretically, under the Assam
                  Elementary Education (Provincialization) Service and Conduct Rules, 1981
WP(c) No.2592/2010
                                                                                Page 3 of 4

                                                           4
                  (hereinafter referred to as “the 1981 Rules”), the employee should have opted
                  for pension under Rule 6 but the Rules became operational, well after the
                  retirement of the employee. In any case, the petitioner has failed to bring any
                  material before the Court to establish that her husband had opted for pension.
                  Therefore, even if we apply the ratio of the Supreme Court judgment applicable
                  for secondary school teachers covered by different set of Rules,, the benefit of
                  pension cannot be conferred to the present employee or to his widow.
                  8.              The Court cannot also be oblivious of the likely consequences for
                  allowing such belated claim for pension after 4 decades. This will open a
                  floodgate of such stale claim, having financial implications for the State’s coffer.
                  Hence on this count also, this is not found to be a deserving case for
                  pension/family pension.
                  9.              As earlier noted, the employee continued in service till 60 years
                  although he should have retired at 58 and conspicuously during his lifetime, he
                  never opted for pension. Therefore for service rendered by such employee, the
                  family pension cannot be granted to the widow, who has approached the Court
                  decades after the retirement/death, of her husband.
                  10.             Another aspect of employee’s career would require the Court’s
                  comment. The superannuation age stipulated under the 1981 Rules is 58 years
                  and therefore the employee whose birth date was 28.2.1918, should have ceased
                  to serve on 28.2.1976, well before the M.E School was provincialized on
                  1.10.1977. Hence the provincialization of the employee on 1.10.1977 at age 59,
                  was perhaps undeserved. Be that as it may, since many decades have gone by,
                  the Court does not wish to pronounce on the justification or otherwise, on the
                  provincialization of the deceased employee.
                  11.             Following the above discussion, this case is found devoid of merit
                  and the same is accordingly dismissed. No cost.
                                                                                       JUDGE
