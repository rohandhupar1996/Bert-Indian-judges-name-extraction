                 HIGH COURT OF ORISSA: CUTTACK
                             O.J.C.No.12010 of 2000
     In the matter of an application under Articles 226 and 227 of the
     Constitution of India.
                                   -------------
     Jagannatha Mallick and another                   ….         Petitioners

     North Electricity Supply Company
     of Orissa Ltd. and others                   ….         Opposite parties
                       For Petitioners    --     Mr.P.R.Jena
                                                 Advocate
                       For Opp. Parties --       None
     PRESENT:
                   THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
     Date of Hearing :12.4.2016        &          Date of Judgment: 26.4.2016
Dr.A.K.Rath, J. In    this  writ  petition    under   Article  226   of   the
     Constitution of India, the petitioners have prayed, inter alia, for a
     direction to the opposite parties to pay compensation for the death
     of their cows and bullocks in electrocution.
     2.          Sans details, the case of the petitioners are that on
     20.7.2000 at about 10 A.M., while their cows and bullocks were
     grazing in the field near the wooden bridge of the village, they came
     in contact with the live electric wire snapped in a nearby water
     body, as a result of which, all died on the spot. On the very same
     day, the petitioners lodged an F.I.R. before the Dhusuri Police
     Station, whereafter Station Diary Entry No.392/20.7.2000 was
     made. On enquiry, it was found that eight numbers of cows and

                                   2
bullocks while crossing the wooden bridge for grazing, they came
in contact with the live wire, which was fallen in the water, as such
the water was charged and all of them died. The dead bodies on
completion of inquest were sent for autopsy. The post-mortem
report reveals that death of the cows and bullocks was caused due
to shock. With this factual scenario, this petition has been filed for
compensation.
3.          Pursuant to issuance of notice, a counter affidavit has
been filed by opposite parties 2 to 4. The opposite parties challenge
the maintainability of the writ application, as the same involves
adjudication of disputed question of facts. There was no negligence
on their parts and all precautionary steps had been taken to avoid
any unnatural incident. The report of the police in connection with
the station dairy entry is not the conclusive proof to substantiate
negligence. The post mortem report does not reveal electrocution of
the animals.
4.          Heard Mr.Jena, learned counsel for the petitioners.
None appears for the opposite parties.
5.          Two points arise for consideration of this Court ;
      (1)  Whether a writ application under Article 226 of the
            Constitution of India is maintainable for payment of
            compensation when death is caused due to
            electrocution ?
      (2)   Whether the opposite parties can deny the liability to
            pay compensation to the petitioners on the death of
            cows and bullocks due to electrocution on the ground
            that there was no negligence on their part ?

                                           3
Point Nos.1 and 2.
6.           The subject of matter of dispute is no more res integra.
An identical matter came up for consideration before a Division
Bench of this Court in the case of T. Bimala v. Cuttack Municipal
Corporation, Cuttack and others, 2015(I) OLR-637. It was held as
follows:-
      “9.    The language of Article 226 of the Constitution does not admit of
      any limitation on the powers of the High Court for the exercise of
      jurisdiction thereunder. The power conferred upon the High Courts
      under Article 226 of the Constitution is wide enough to reach injustice
      wherever it is found. The apex Court in catena of the decisions laid
      down certain guidelines and self-imposed limitations have been put
      there subject to which the High Courts would exercise jurisdiction.
      Those guidelines cannot be mandatory in all circumstances. When a
      citizen approaches the High Court in writ petition that a wrong is
      caused, the High Court will step into protect him, whether that wrong
      was done by the State or an instrumentality of the State. The High Court
      cannot pull down the shutters.
      10.    In M.S. Grewal v. Deep Chand Sood, (2001) 8 SCC 151, the apex
      Court observed as under :
             “Next is the issue of “maintainability of the writ petition” before the High
             Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The appellants though
             initially very strongly contended that while the negligence aspect has
             been dealt with under penal laws already, the claim for compensation
             cannot but be left to be adjudicated by the civil laws and thus the Civil
             Court’s jurisdiction ought to have been invoked rather than by way of a
             writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. This plea of non-
             maintainability of the writ petition though advanced at the initial stage of
             the submissions but subsequently the same was not pressed and as
             such we need not detain ourselves on that score, excepting however
             recording that the law Courts exist for the society and they have an
             obligation to meet the social aspirations of citizens since law Courts must
             also respond to the needs of the people. In this context, reference may be
             made to two decisions of this Court : the first in line is the decision in
             Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa, (AIR 1993 SC 1960) wherein this
             Court relying upon the decision in Rudal Sah (Rudal Sah v. State of
             Bihar), (AIR 1983 SC 1086) decried the illegality and impropriety in
             awarding compensation in a proceeding in which the Court’s power
             under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution stands involved and thus
             observed that it was a clear case for award of compensation to the
             petitioner for custodial death of her son. It is undoubtedly true, however,
             that in the present context, there is no infringement of the State’s
             obligation, unless of course the State can also be termed to be joint
             tortfeasor, but since the case of the parties stands restricted and without

                                      4
        imparting any liability on the State, we do not deem it expedient to deal
        with the issue any further except noting the two decisions of this Court
        as above and without expression of any opinion in regard thereto.”
11.     In this connection, we would like to profitably quote a paragraph
from a decision of Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Ramesh
Singh Pawar v. Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board and others, AIR 2005
MP 2. It is held as follows:
          “Currently judicial attitude has taken a shift from the old doctrine
          concept and the traditional jurisprudentia system – affection of the
          people has been taken note of rather serious and the judicial concern
          thus stands on a footing to provide expeditious relief to an individual
          when needed rather than taking recourse to the old conservative
          doctrine of the Civil Court’s obligation to award damages. As a matter
          of fact the decision in D.K. Basu has not only dealt with the issue in a
          manner apposite to the social need of the “Country but the learned
          Judge with his usual felicity of expression firmly established the
          current trend of justice-oriented approach”. Law Courts will lose their
          efficacy if they cannot possibly respond to the need of the society –
          technicalities their might be many but the justice-oriented approach
          ought not to be thwarted on the basis of such technicality since
          technicality cannot and ought not to outweigh the course of justice.”
12.     Thus we hold that a writ application for payment of compensation
for the death of a person in electrocution is maintainable when the
undisputed facts clearly reveal the same.
13.     A person undertaking an activity involving hazardous or risky
exposure to human life is liable under law of torts to compensate for the
injury suffered by any other person, irrespective of any negligence or
carelessness on the part of the managers of such undertakings. The
basis of such liability is the foreseeable risk inherent in the very nature
of such activity. The liability cast on such person is known, in law, as
“strict liability”.
14.     The doctrine of strict liability has its origin in English Common
Law when it was propounded in the celebrated case of Rylands v.
Fletcher, 1868 Law Reports (3) HL 330, Justice Blackburn had observed
thus:
        “The rule of law is that the person who, for his own purpose, brings on
        his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it
        escapes, must keep it at his peril, and if he does so he is prima facie
        answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its
        escape.”
15.     There are seven exceptions formulated by means of case law to
the said doctrine. One of the exceptions is that “Act of stranger i.e. if the

                                     5
escape was caused by the unforeceable act of a stranger, the rule does
not apply”. (Winfield on Tort, 15th Edn. Page 535).
16.    The rule of strict liability has been approved and followed in many
subsequent decisions in England and decisions of the apex Court are a
legion to that effect. A Constitution Bench of the apex Court in Charan
Lal Sahu v. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 1480 and a Division Bench in
Gujarat State Road Transport Corpn. V. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai, AIR
1987 SC 1690 had followed with approval the principle in Rylands
(supra). The same principle was reiterated in Kaushnuma Begum v. New
India Assurance Co. Ltd., AIR 2001 SC 485.
17.    Sukamani Das (supra), Timudu Oram (supra) on which reliance
has been placed, the question of a strict liability was not taken up in
those cases.
18.    Sukamani cannot be understood as laying a law that in every
case of tortious liability recourse must be had to a suit. When there is
negligence on the face of it and infringement of Article 21 is there, it
cannot be said that there will be any bar to proceed under Article 226 of
the Constitution, since right of life is one the basic human rights
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.(emphasis laid)
19.    In M.P. Electricity Board v. Shail Kumar and others, AIR 2002 SC
551, one Jogendra Singh, a workman in a factory, was returning from
his factory on the night of 23.8.1997 riding on a bicycle. There was rain
and hence the road was partially inundated with water. The cyclist did
not notice the live wire on the road and hence he rode the vehicle over
the wire which twitched and snatched him and he was instantaneously
electrocuted. He fell down and died within minutes. When the action
was brought by his widow and minor son, a plea was taken by the Board
that one Hari Gaikwad had taken a wire from the main supply line in
order to siphon the energy for his own use and the said act of pilferage
was done clandestinely without even the notice of the Board and that
the line got unfastened from the hook and it fell on the road over which
the cycle ridden by the deceased slided resulting in the instantaneous
electrocution. In paragraph 7, the apex Court held as follows:
       “It is an admitted fact that the responsibility to supply electric energy in
       the particular locality was statutorily conferred on the Board. If the
       energy so transmitted causes injury or death of a human, being, who
       gets unknowingly trapped into if the primary liability to compensate the
       sufferer is that of the supplier of the electric energy. So long as the
       voltage of electricity transmitted through the wires is potentially of
       dangerous dimension the managers of its supply have the added duty to
       take all safety measures to prevent escape of such energy or to see that
       the wire snapped would not remain live on the road as users of such
       road would be under peril. It is no defence on the part of the
       management of the Board that somebody committed mischief by
       siphoning such energy of his private property and that the electrocution
       was from such diverted line. It is the look out of the managers of the

                                            6
            supply system to prevent such pilferage by installing necessary devices.
            At any rate, if any live wire got snapped and fell on the public road the
            electric current thereon should automatically have been disrupted.
            Authorities manning such dangerous commodities have extra duty to
            chalk out measures to prevent such mishaps.” (emphasis laid)
      20.   The principle of res ipsa loquitur is well known. It is explained in
      a very illustrative passage in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edn., pp.
      568-569, which reads as follows:
            “Doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The onus of proof, which lies on a party
            alleging negligence is, as pointed out, that he should establish his case
            by a pre-ponderance of probabilities. This he will normally have to do by
            proving that the other party acted carelessly. Such evidence is not always
            forthcoming. It is possible, however, in certain cases for him to rely on
            the mere fact that something happened as affording prima facie evidence
            of want of due care on the other’s part: ‘res ipsa loquitur is a principle
            which helps him to do so’. In effect, therefore, reliance on it is a
            confession by the plaintiff that he has no affirmative evidence of
            negligence. The classic statement of the circumstances in which he is
            able to do so is by Erle, C.J.:
                    ‘There must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the
            thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his
            servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things
            does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it
            affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the
            defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.’
            It is no more than a rule of evidence and states no principle of law. “This
            convenient and succinct formula”, said Morris, L.J., “possesses no magic
            qualities; nor has it any added virtue, other than that of brevity, merely
            because it is expressed in Latin”. It is only a convenient label to apply to
            a set of circumstances in which a plaintiff proves a case so as to call for a
            rebuttal from the defendant, without having to allege and prove any
            specific act or omission on the part of the defendant. He merely proves a
            result, not any particular act or omission producing the result. The court
            hears only the plaintiff’s side of the story, and if this makes it more
            probable than not that the occurrence was caused by the negligence of
            the defendant, the doctrine res ipsa loquitur is said to apply, and the
            plaintiff will be entitled to succeed unless the defendant by evidence
            rebuts that probability. It is not necessary for res ipsa loquitur to be
            specifically pleaded.”
7.          On the anvil of the decisions cited supra, the case of the
petitioners may be examined. Immediately after the occurrence, the
matter was reported to the police station. Thereafter Station Diary
Entry No.392/20.7.2000 was made. The inquest report shows that
cause of death of cows and bullocks was due to electric shock. The

                                   7
postmortem report reveals that the death of cows and bullocks was
caused due to shock as a result of electrocution. Thus the
irresistible conclusion is that the cows and bullocks of the
petitioners died due to electrocution. As held above, a person
undertaking an activity involving hazardous or risky exposure to
human life is liable under law of torts to compensate for the injury
suffered by any other person, irrespective of any negligence or
carelessness on the part of the managers of such undertakings.
The basis of such liability is the foreseeable risk inherent in the
very nature of such activity. It is no defence on the part of the
opposite parties that somebody committed mischief by siphoning
such energy of his private property and that the electrocution was
from such diverted line. It is the look out of the opposite parties to
prevent such pilferage by installing necessary devices. In the event
any live wire got snapped and fell on the public road the electric
current    thereon   should  automatically   have   been   disrupted.
Authorities manning such dangerous commodities have extra duty
to chalk out measures to prevent such mishaps. The opposite
parties can not shirk their responsibility of maintenance on trivial
grounds. For the negligence on the part of the opposite parties in
maintaining the electric line, six numbers of cows and two
numbers of bullocks died due to electrocution. The petitioners
belong to the lower rung of the society. The cattle were the source
of their livelihood. They are deprived of the same. In view of the
same, this Court directs the opposite parties to pay interim
compensation of Rs.50,000/-(Fifty Thousand) to petitioner no.1 for
the death of four numbers of cows and two numbers of bullocks
and Rs.15,000/- (Fifteen Thousand) to petitioner no.2 for the death

                                           8
of two numbers of cows within two months leaving the petitioners
to work out their remedies in common law for higher compensation.
                   The writ petition is allowed. No costs.
                                                      ………….…………….
