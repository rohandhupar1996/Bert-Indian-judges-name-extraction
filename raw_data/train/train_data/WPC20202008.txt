2)      The Governing Body of Kanya Mahavidyalaya, Guwahati, while it was in
venture stage, on 05.02.1986 appointed the petitioner as a Lecturer in Philosophy
Department of said College. After working for about 11 (eleven) years, the
Governing Body of said College on 09.01.1997 released the petitioner from service
along with 4 other Lecturers of said college, as they were under qualified for such
posts. The petitioner on 23.01.1997 submitted a representation before the
Principal-cum-Secretary of said College stating her grievances praying before the
said authority to allow her to continue in service in said College. Said authority of
the College after considering her said representation, verbally allowed the
 WP(C) No. 2020 of 2008                                                 Page 2 of 8

petitioner to continue in her service in said College from 02.04.1998. In the
meanwhile, petitioner in the year 1990 obtained M.Phil Degree and in the year
2004 Ph.D. Degree, both from the Gauhati University. However, by order dated
08.10.2007 the Principal of said College served the petitioner with a termination
order. On her enquiry, she came to know that on 23.07.2007, 10.09.2007 and
20.09.2007, the State Government in the Higher Education Department informed
the authority of said college that the University Grants Commission has prescribed
the qualification for appointment of a Lecturer in a Degree College that the
incumbent must have 55% minimum marks in respect of general candidates and
50% minimum marks in case of SC/ST reserved candidates in their Master Degree
and must be National Eligibility Test/State Level Eligibility Test qualified or having
M.Phil/Ph.D. degree and candidates not having such requisite norms and eligibility
cannot be considered for the post of Lecturers in any such Degree Colleges. The
petitioner contended that with regard to Lecturers of some other Colleges in
Assam under Deficit System of Grants-in-Aid, who did not possess the requisite
UGC norms, but having M.Phil or Ph.D. Degree beyond their Master Degree were
retained in service and their services were approved by various orders issued by
the Education Department of the State during the period from 1992-1999 and as
she is qualified by obtaining M.Phil and Ph.D. Degree, with 21 years of long
service experience as a Lecturer in said Kanya Mahavidyalaya, therefore, she
should be reinstated in her service in the post of Lecturer in Philosophy in said
college and to provide her all consequential benefits, since the relevant UGC
norms as prescribed in the UGC Regulations, 1991 as well as the Ordinance of the
Gauhati University, 2000 are not applicable in her case.
3)      It is further submitted by the petitioner that she preferred an appeal
before the Governing Body of the Kanya Mahavidyalaya, which according to had
not been considered.
4)      Hence this Writ Petition by the petitioner for setting aside the Government
letters dated 23.07.2007, 10.09.2007 and 20.09.2007 and to quash the order
dated 08.10.2007 terminating her service from said Kanya Mahavidyalaya,
Guwahati and to reinstate her in service in said college as Lecturer in Philosophy,
granting her all consequential benefits.
  WP(C) No. 2020 of 2008                                                  Page 3 of 8

5)      On behalf of the petitioner, it is contended that while she was appointed
as a Lecturer in the College in February, 1996, the UGC norms was not in force
and as such, she was duly appointed in the College in question where she served
for 21 long years till her termination by Order dated 08.10.2007. Moreover, she
had also obtained M.Phil and Ph.D. Degrees prior to her termination from service
and those two Higher Degrees made her eligible to continue as a Lecturer in the
said College. In this regard, the petitioners have placed reliance on the Judgments
reported in (1981) 3 SCC 528 (B R Ramabhadriah -Vs- Secretary, Food and
Agriculture Department, Andhra Pradesh & others), AIR 1993 SC 2592 (Smt.
Naseem Bano -Vs- state of U.P. and Others), (2001) 5 SCC 664 (Tandon Brothers
-Vs- State of W.B. and Others), (2003) 4 SCC 557 (Canara Bank and Others -Vs-
Debasis Das and Others) and (1999) 2 GLT 456 (Saiful Islam -Vs- State of Assam
and Others). Relying on the aforesaid decisions, Mr. Sarma, learned senior
counsel on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the respondents in their
affidavit did not reply the statements made by her and as such that amounts to
acceptance of the submission of the petitioner. It is further submitted that the
Governing Body of the College while terminating the service of the petitioner by
order dated 08.10.2007, she was not given any opportunity of hearing and that as
said College at that relevant time was a non deficit college, therefore, the UGC
norms for a Lecturer in a degree college were not applicable and therefore, her
appointment as Lecturer without 55% in her Master Degree cannot be termed as
under-qualified. The petitioner also submitted that services of similarly placed
Lecturers not having 55% marks in their Master Degree, were regularised by the
State Governments by its Notification issued in September, 2001 that instead of
55% marks in Master Degree, the Government in the Higher Education
Department took a decision to regularise the services of such Lecturers in Degree
College having 52.5% in their Master Degree appointed in such Colleges prior to
August, 1998.
6)      The Director of Higher Education, Assam in his affidavit on behalf of the
State respondents stated that by Communication No. B(2)H.119/92/114 dated
12.11.1997, the State Government in the Higher Education Department gave its
concurrence to the permission for temporary affiliation upto 3 (three) years
 WP(C) No. 2020 of 2008                                                 Page 4 of 8

Degree Course part-II Standard to said Kanya Mahavidyalaya to begin with the
subjects of English, MIL (Major Indian Language in Assamese, Bengali and Hindi)
and NL. Assamese, Political Science, Economics, Education, History and
Philosophy for the session 1994 - 1995, subject to fulfillment of the conditions laid
down by the University, with the observation that such grant of permission/
affiliation, the Government will not take any financial liability for the increase of
the teaching staff in said College and further observed that the State will not take
any liability for maintaining the posts of part-time teachers or teachers not having
the qualification as prescribed under the norms.
7)        It is submitted by the State respondents that after said Government
concurrence dated 12.11.1997, said Kanya Mahavidyalaya started receiving Ad-
hoc Recurring Grants-in-Aid from the State Government and that as the petitioner
does not have the requisite 55% marks in her Master Degree as per the norms
prescribed by the UGC, the petitioner is not eligible for the post of Lecturer in the
Degree College which can also be reflected from the concurrence granted by the
Government on 12.11.1997. The State respondents further submitted that the
Principal of YWCA Junior College, Guwahati by his letter dated 08.10.2008
clarified that the petitioner is working in his institution as full time Lecturer in a
consolidated salary with contribution to her provident fund since 01.08.1995 and
as such it is submitted that it is not possible for a Lecturer to work at the same
time in two different colleges/institution and therefore, submitted that the claim of
the petitioner should be rejected.
8)        Learned Standing Counsel for the Higher Education Department submitted
that the petitioner had only 42.3% in her Master Degree and in that case the
Government decision of 2001 considering to regularise the services of the
Lecturers having 52.5% is not applicable to the petitioner as she is not entitled to
such benefit. It is also placed by the learned standing counsel that the
Government concurrence to the permission and affiliation vide communication
dated 12.11.1997 granting affiliation to said Kanya Mahavidyalaya upto 3 (three)
years Degree Course was very specific that such Government concurrence is not
possible when such institutions comprises of teachers who are not qualified and
does not have the required norms.
  WP(C) No. 2020 of 2008                                                  Page 5 of 8

9)      The respondent Nos. 4 & 5 on behalf of the College filed their affidavit in
the matter stating that the authorities in the Higher Education Department vide
Communication dated 23.07.2007 informed the Principal of the College that the
UGC have prescribed the qualification for appointment of Lecturer in Degree
Colleges which provides that the incumbent must be a Master Degree holder with
55% in respect of general candidates and 50% in case of reserved SC/ST
candidates with either NET/SLET or M.Phil/Ph.D. Degree and since the petitioner
did not possess the required norms of 55% marks in her Master Degree as
prescribed by the UGC, she is not eligible for the post of Lecturer in the College.
The said respondents also submitted that the Inspector of College vide
communication dated 20.09.2007 informed the Principal of said College to adhere
to the prescribed UGC norms and to take necessary actions and that pursuant to
the said communication of the Higher Education Department, the Governing Body
of said Kanya Mahavidyalaya by its resolution No. 1 dated 29.09.2007
unanimously resolved to terminate the petitioner and another Lecturer of the
College from their services due to lack of their requisite norms and accordingly, by
Order dated 08.10.2007 the authority of said college terminated the service of
petitioner from the said college. It is also submitted by the said respondent Nos. 4
& 5 that at the time of termination of service of petitioner from said college in
October, 2007; it was not a provincialised college and it was the Governing Body
of said college, who was the final authority regarding the administration,
management, control, appointment, disciplinary action etc. with regard to the
teaching and non-teaching staff of said College.
10)     Mr. Roy, learned counsel appearing for the respondents submits that there
is no requirement for giving any hearing to the petitioner prior to the issuance of
termination Order 08.10.2007 since it did not cause any prejudice to her, since at
the time of issuance of said termination Oder dated 08.10.2007, the petitioner
was already a full time Lecturer in YWCA Junior College for Women Education at
Guwahati, where since 01.08.1995, she was receiving regular monthly salaries
with contribution towards her provident fund.
11)     On being enquired, said respondents clarified that as the petitioner did not
possess the requisite UGC norms of having 55% in her Master Degree, the
  WP(C) No. 2020 of 2008                                                Page 6 of 8

authority of said college cannot consider the continuation of her service in said
Kanya Mahavidyalaya, Guwahati.
12)     It has also been brought to the notice of the Court that by order dated
20.01.2014, said Kanya Mahavidyalaya has been brought under provincialisation
under    the    provisions    of  the   Assam     Venture   Educational  Institutions
(Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011 as amended in 2012. After the said 2011
Act, amended in 2012 has now been declared as un-constitutional by this High
Court, the State Government has enacted the Assam Education (Provincialisation
of Services of Teachers and Re-Organisation of Educational Institutions) Act, 2017
which have now come into force w.e.f 11.04.2017.
13)     After considering the Judgments cited by the petitioner and upon hearing
the arguments of the parties, the Court found that the Government concurrence
dated 12.11.1997 convening the concurrence to the permission and affiliation for
starting 3 (three) years Degree Course of said Kanya Mahavidyalaya with the
relevant subjects was conditional, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions laid
down by the University, with the observation that in the said college there must
not be any teachers who are not qualified or without having the prescribed norms
and this decision of the State Government dated 12.11.1997 regarding the
concurrence for the College in question for a 3 (three) years Degree Course is not
under challenge.
14)     Even to consider the case of the petitioner to give her the benefit of the
Government letter dated 24.12.1996 issued by the Higher Education Department,
that was communicated by the Director of Higher Education, Assam vide its letter
dated 06.09.2001, it is seen from the same that benefit cannot be given to the
petitioner on the basis of said decision dated 24.12.1996 of the State Government
since the State Government decided that for the Lecturers who were appointed
prior to 15.12.1998, for them the UGC norms of having 55% marks in Master
Degree were relaxed to 52.5% and above marks in Master Degree with Honours
in First degree with good academic record.         But in the present case from the
petition itself it is reflected that the petitioner in her MA Examination of 1988,
secured only 379 marks out of total 800 marks, which is equivalent to 47.37%
  WP(C) No. 2020 of 2008                                                Page 7 of 8

only and therefore, benefit of such relaxation as per the decision of the State
Government dated 24.12.1996, relaxing the UGC norms in the case of the
petitioner cannot be considered. Further, the petitioner could not place any
relevant materials to the claims of the respondents that since 01.08.1995 she is
not a full time Lecturer in the YWCA Junior College for Women Education,
Guwahati receiving regular monthly salary with contribution to her provident fund.
15)     For the reasons above, the prayer made by the petitioner in this petition
cannot be considered and this writ petition being devoid of merits, stands
dismissed.
