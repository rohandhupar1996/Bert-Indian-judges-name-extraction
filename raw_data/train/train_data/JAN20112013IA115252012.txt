       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH
JAYANT NATH, J.
IA No. 11525/2012(u/O 39 R 1 & 2)
   1. The present Suit has been filed by the plaintiff seeking a decree
       declaring Enquiry Report dated       15.01.2012 and the consequent
       expulsion letter dated 21.5.2012 suspending the plaintiff’s primary
       membership of the defendant No.1 to be null and void. Alongwith the
       Suit the present application is filed seeking stay of the operation of
       letter dated 21.5.2012.
   2. The brief facts as narrated in the plaint are that the plaintiff is stated
       to be a member of defendant No.1 Club. Defendant No.1 Club is
       registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860. Defendants
       No.2 and 3 are the President and Secretary of the Club and are stated
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                    Page 1 of 12

       to be responsible for the day to day affairs. The plaintiff was elected
       and has been serving as the General Secretary of the Club since the
       year 2008. Elections were held on 27.3.2011 when the plaintiff lost in
       the elections to defendant No.3 with a margin of 250 votes. It is
       stated that the defendants with mala fide intention to settle their
       personal grudges and to conceal their illegal activities issued a letter
       dated 16.6.2011 to the plaintiff suspending his membership from
       defendant No.1 Club. The plaintiff challenged the said letter in a suit
       filed in this High Court being CS(OS)1675/2011. Vide Order dated
       26.7.2011 this Court set aside the said letter and directed the
       defendant to conduct an enquiry against the plaintiff regarding all the
       allegations levied against him. The enquiry was to be concluded
       within one month. On 4.8.2011 the defendants issued a letter giving
       an option to the plaintiff to choose three Committee members of the
       Club from a list of six members so as to constitute the enquiry panel.
       The Managing Committee issued a charge sheet to the plaintiff where
       three different charges were levied The charges read as follows:-
              “I     That the plaintiff has while functioning as
              general secretary indulged in embezzlement and
              misappropriation of the official records thus causing
              financial loss to club.
              II     That the plaintiff while functioning as general
              secretary since 2008 misused his official position by
              himself indulging in falsification of record and forgery
              and also influenced and forced his subordinate staff to
              make false and fictions entries in the official record for
              his personal pecuniary benefits.
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                   Page 2 of 12

               III    That the plaintiff while functioning as general
               secretary since 2008 cheated the club for his personal
               pecuniary benefits causing loss loss of revenue and
               reputation to the club.”
   3. It is stated that the plaintiff filed a response to the charge sheet. It is
       further stated that hearings took place virtually every alternate day
       and that on 20.10.2011 the Managing Committee decided that as there
       is no evidence against the plaintiff, the enquiry proceedings be closed.
       On 5.2.2012 the plaintiff claims that he received a Show Cause Notice
       issued by defendant No.3 where it was for the first time informed to
       the plaintiff that the enquiry proceedings have been concluded and
       enquiry report was submitted on 15.1.2012 holding the plaintiff guilty
       of all the charges levelled against the plaintiff.          The plaintiff
       challenged the validity and legality of the Enquiry Report.              The
       plaintiff submitted a written response on 13.2.2012. The plaintiff
       demanded a personal hearing from the Managing Committee which
       was afforded to him on 3.4.2012 and 7.5.2012. On 11.5.2012 the
       plaintiff received another letter calling upon him to deposit Rs.7.18
       lacs within three days. In reply, the plaintiff without admitting any
       liability is stated to have offered to deposit the money. The plaintiff
       on 28.5.2012 received a letter dated 21.5.2012 informing the plaintiff
       that the Managing Committee passed a resolution expelling him from
       the primary membership of the defendant club. Hence, the present
       Suit has been filed.
   4. The defendants have filed their written statement. The defendants
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                   Page 3 of 12

       have stated that the plaintiff as General Secretary of the Club
       misappropriated the official funds and caused loss to the Club to the
       extent of Rs.6,62,050/-. It is further stated that he misused his official
       position by committing falsification of record and forgery and
       influencing the supporting staff. It is stated that the said amount was
       received by the plaintiff on account of membership fee in cash from
       three persons who were enrolled as members.            No receipts were
       issued to the said three persons. No entries were made in the Club
       Records about the money received. The contention of the plaintiff
       that the said amount received was paid in front of the President of the
       Club to Mr.Chopra to settle some MCD issues is denied. It is stated
       that this is only an afterthought to justify non deposit of money
       admittedly received by the plaintiff. It is further pointed out that the
       Enquiry Committee has after giving full opportunity to the plaintiff
       submitted its report pointing out the said forgery, falsification and
       manipulation of records and financial loss caused to the club. It is
       further stated that the defence put up by the plaintiff is absolutely
       sham and moonshine. It is stated that the charges are grave, serious
       and of financial embezzlement and hence the present Suit and the
       present application are liable to be dismissed.
   5. I have heard learned counsel for the parties.
   6. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied upon Clause 11(c) of the
       Rules of the defendant club, which stipulate that a member is liable to
       be expelled by a resolution of the Managing Committee provided not
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                  Page 4 of 12

       less than 2/3rd of the members of the Managing Committing are
       present. The said Clause reads as follows:-
                  “11....
                  (c) If any member refuses or neglects to comply with
                  any of the bye-laws, Rules and Regulations and
                  directions and is guilty of such conduct as in the
                  opinion of the Managing Committee is likely to
                  endanger the harmony or in its opinion prejudicially
                  affects the character or stability or interests of the club,
                  such member shall be liable to be expelled by a
                  resolution of the Managing Committee provided that
                  not less than 2/3rd of the members of the Managing
                  Committee present at the meeting shall have voted in
                  favour of the same and provided also that at least 7 days
                  notice of the meeting is given at which such resolution
                  for his expulsion is intended to be moved and that he
                  shall at such meeting and before the passing of such
                  resolution have had an opportunity of giving such
                  defence as he may think fit. It shall be in the power of
                  the Managing Committee to exclude such member from
                  the club till such resolution has either been passed or
                  rejected. The Managing Committee shall give or post
                  to him by registered post a letter containing a
                  notification of the said resolution. On the passing of
                  such resolution the member shall forwith cease to be a
                  member of the club and shall not have any claim
                  against the Managing Committee or the club. Any fees
                  or subscription paid in advance after adjusting the same
                  towards the dues by him shall be refundable. Quorum
                  at such meeting shall be ten members instead of five
                  members of the Managing Committee. No appeal shall
                  lie from the decision of the Managing Committee.”
   7. It is stated that in terms of the above Clause no notice of meeting was
       given when such resolution of expulsion was moved and no hearing
       was given to the plaintiff when such resolution was considered by the
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                    Page 5 of 12

       Managing Committee.
   8.    Reliance is also placed on the Order of the High Court dated
       26.7.2011 which was a consent order whereby defendants had agreed
       to revoke the suspension order and conduct an Enquiry against the
       plaintiff and to conclude the same within one month. It is stated that
       the enquiry that has been conducted was not in accordance with the
       said order of this Court. Hence, it is stated that expulsion of the
       plaintiff is not in accordance with Clause 11(c) of the Rules of the
       Club and the Order passed by this Court dated 26.7.2011. Hence, it
       is contended that the present application is liable to be allowed and an
       injunction order is liable to be passed staying the operation of the
       letter dated 21.5.2012 expelling the defendant from membership of
       the plaintiff.
   9. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has further submitted that his clients
       are ready to deposit the sum of Rs.7 lacs which is the amount said to
       have been taken by the plaintiff in Court. He also submits that the
       expulsion order dated 21.5.2012 wrongly relies on a communication
       to state that the plaintiff has admitted his liability. Learned counsel
       for the plaintiff has also relied upon the judgments in Deepak
       R.Mehtra & Ors. versus National Sports Club of India & Ors.
       Manu/DE/1686/2009 to contend that this Court has powers to grant
       injunction as sought for.
   10.On the other hand, learned counsel for the defendant has submitted
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                   Page 6 of 12

       that the applicable clause for expulsion of the plaintiff is not Clause
       11(c) but Clause 11(a) where the Managing Committee can suspend
       or expel a member by a resolution of the Committee to be passed by
       3/4th members present at the meeting. Reliance is also placed on the
       Show Cause Notice issued by defendant No.1 on 4.2.2012 to which
       Reply was filed by the plaintiff. Reliance is also placed on letter sent
       by the plaintiff where he is stated to have agreed to deposit
       Rs.7,18,335/- by arranging cheques from three members which were
       due from them. It is stressed that serious charges of embezzlement
       and fraud have been duly proved by a duly constituted Enquiry
       Committee. The Enquiry Committee has also been constituted in
       accordance with the order of this High Court dated 26.7.2011. It is
       further stated that since an Order has already been passed expelling
       the defendant from membership of the Club on 21.5.2012, no purpose
       will be served now in October 2013 by staying the said order. It is
       further stated that the defendants are ready in case a Court
       Commissioner is appointed to record evidence so that evidence is
       concluded and the matter can be expeditiously disposed of.
   11.Prima facie it appears that the applicable Clause for expulsion of the
       plaintiff of the Rules of the defendant club is 11(c) of the Rules of the
       defendant Club which requires that a member can be expelled on the
       grounds as stated in the said Clause only after giving seven days’
       notice of the meeting in which such resolution for expulsion is
       intended to be moved and at such meeting before passing such
       resolution the member must have an opportunity of giving such
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                  Page 7 of 12

       defence as he may think fit.
   12.In paragraph 28 of the plaint a specific averment has been made by
       the plaintiff that in terms of Rule 11(c) of the bye-laws the Managing
       Committee did not follow the procedure. The written statement in the
       corresponding paragraph does not deny that Rule 11(c) of the bye-
       laws are not applicable to the facts of the present case. Hence, the
       applicable provision would prima facie be Rule 11(c) of the bye-laws
       of defendant No.1 Club. For expulsion of the plaintiff as a member of
       the defendant No.1 Club, prima face the procedure as prescribed in
       the said clause would have to be followed. The submissions of the
       learned counsel for the defendant to the contrary do not appear to be
       correct.
   13.A perusal of the record would show that a Show Cause Notice has
       been given to the plaintiff on 4.2.2012 whereby he was asked to show
       cause as to why his membership be not terminated in the light of
       findings of the enquiry panel holding him guilty of the charges
       levelled by the Managing Committee. Admittedly, a hearing was also
       given to the plaintiff as admitted by the plaintiff himself in paragraph
       22 of the plaint where it is stated that the Managing Committee heard
       him on 03.04.2012 and 7.5.2012 where he made oral as well as
       written representations. It is true that on 3.4.2012 or 7.5.2012 the
       Managing Committee did not pass the resolution expelling the
       plaintiff from the Membership of the Club. This appears to have been
       done by the Managing Committee in its meeting held on 21.5.2012.
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                  Page 8 of 12

       The contention of the plaintiff that a hearing ought to have been given
       to the plaintiff also on 21.5.2012 when the resolution was passed by
       the Managing Committee expelling the plaintiff from the membership
       of the club prima facie does not appear to be correct. The essence of
       Clause 11(c) of the Rules of the Club is that before expulsion of a
       member, he must be given adequate opportunity of explaining
       himself. Hence, before such a resolution is passed by the Managing
       Committee, seven days’ notice of the meeting is to be given if a
       resolution of expulsion is intended to be moved and at such meeting
       an opportunity of giving his defence should also be given to the
       member intended to be expelled. In the present case there is no
       dispute that the notice was received and the Managing Committee
       heard the plaintiff. Hence, prima facie the Managing Committee of
       defendant club gave full opportunity to the plaintiff to give his version
       and also gave him an oral hearing. Hence, prima facie Clause 11(c)
       of the Club Regulations was complied with. It is not possible to
       accept that after the plaintiff has been fully heard, if the meeting is
       adjourned in an adjourned meeting also the plaintiff must be present
       and heard all over again. The contention of the plaintiff to the said
       extent does not appear correct.
   14.One must also take into account the fact that the resolution of
       defendant No.1’s Managing Committee was passed based on the
       report of an enquiry Committee. The Enquiry Committee had been
       appointed pursuant to a consent order passed by this Court on
       26.7.2011.     Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an application for
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                  Page 9 of 12

       clarification of the said order dated 16.07.2011 on 18.8.2011. The
       application was disposed of whereby some changes were made in the
       composition of the Enquiry Committee by the defendant. Learned
       Senior counsel who appeared for the plaintiff on instructions from the
       plaintiff had submitted in the Court hearing on 18.08.2011 that the
       offer of defendants that they were willing to replace Mr.Bhupesh
       Ahuja with Mr.Kuldip Singh Channa as a Member of the Enquiry
       Committee was acceptable to the plaintiff. Hence, the plaintiff had
       accepted the composition of the Enquiry Committee. This Enquiry
       Committee has after detailed enquiry found the plaintiff guilty of all
       the charges levelled against him.
   15. I may also note that the injunction order that is now sought in the
       present application if granted would actually tantamount to allowing
       the Suit itself. The Hon’ble Supreme Court while dealing with the
       case of the Writ Petitioner in the case of Bank of Maharasthra versus
       Race Shipping & Transport Co.Pvt.Ltd. and Another, (1995) 3 SCC
       257 in para11 held as follows:-
              “Time and again this Court has deprecated the practice of
              granting interim orders which practically give the
              principal relief sought in the petition for no better reason
              than that a prima facie case has been made out, without
              being concerned about the balance of convenience, the
              public interest and a host of other considerations.”
   16.Reference may also be had to the judgment relied upon by learned
       counsel for the plaintiff. In the case of Deepak R.Mehtra & Ors.
       versus National Sports Club of India, (supra) this Court noted the
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                  Page 10 of 12

       legal position pertaining to Management of Clubs. Paragraph 11 of
       the said judgment reads as under:-
              “11.The Apex Court in T.P.Daver v.Lodge Victoria
              MANU/SC/0018/1962: AIR 1963 SC 1144 held that
              jurisdiction of a civil court in such matters is rather limited; it
              cannot obviously sit as a court of appeal from decisions of such
              body; it can set aside the order of such a body, if the body acts
              without jurisdiction or does not act in good faith or acts in
              violation of principles of natural justice. The Apex Court again
              in B.C.C.I.v.Netaji Cricket Club MANU/SC/0019/2005: AIR
              2005 SC 592, in para 82 of the judgment held that an
              association or a club which has framed its rules are bound
              thereby. The strict implementation of such rules is imperative.
              Necesarily, the office bearer in terms of the Memorandum and
              Articles of Association must not only act within the four
              corners thereof but exercise their respective powers in an
              honest and fair manner. In Kalyan Kumar Dutta Gupta v.
              B.M.Verma MANU/WB/0024/1995: AIR 1995 Cal.140(DB),
              the civil court was held to have jurisdiction where allegation
              was that the club had followed a procedure not warranted by
              the Rules of the Club.”
   17. In my view prima facie plaintiff has not been able to show that
       defendant no.1 has no jurisdiction or has not acted in good faith or has
       violated any of the principles of natural justice.
   18. Keeping in view the above facts the plaintiff has failed to make out a
       prima facie case.    Balance of convenience is also not in favour of the
       plaintiff. Directions have already been passed for appointment of a
       Court Commissioner who has been directed to endeavour to complete
       the recording of evidence of the parties within three months from
       today. It would not be appropriate, at this stage on the facts of this
       case, to stay the expulsion of the plaintiff from membership of
CS(OS)No1848/2012                                                  Page 11 of 12

       defendant No.1 Club.           The present application is accordingly
       dismissed.
   19. It is clarified that the views expressed herein are for the purpose of
       disposal of this application. Parties are free to raise their contention at
       the time of final adjudication of the suit.
   20.It is, further clarified that in case there is needless delay in completion
       of evidence by the defendants, the plaintiff would have liberty to
       approach this Court again for appropriate orders/directions to expedite
       the trial/restoration of his membership.

   21.List the matter before Joint Registrar on 03.02.2014 for further
