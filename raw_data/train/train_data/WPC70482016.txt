                                                                   ............ Petitioner

                                             BEFORE
                        HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.M. BUJOR BARUA
                       For the petitioner:       Mr. B.D.Das, Sr. Adv

                       Date of Judgment:       13.06.2017.
                          JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
               Heard Mr. B.D. Das, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, Ms. K.
      Dutta, learned State Counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 1 and 3, Mr.
      P.J. Phukan, learned Counsel appearing for the Pollution Control Board, being
      the respondent No.2 and Mr. R. Baruah, learned counsel appearing for the
      private respondent Nos. 4 and 5.
      2.       The petitioner, by two registered Sale Deeds dated 23.08.2010, had
      purchased an existing brick industry from one Sri Dilip Kumar Mazumdar,
      which was originally set up in the year 2005. The said brick kiln is located
      over a plot of land measuring 21 bighas 10 lechas covered by Dag No.123,
      Patta No.19 situated at village Chengmari Kisam under Mayong Mouza in the
      district of Morigaon. It is stated that the petitioner thereafter applied for No
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                            Page 1 of 12

      Objection Certificate from the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon for operating
      the brick kiln in his name and accordingly by an order dated 02.09.2011,
      permission was granted to operate the brick kiln. The permission was granted
      under certain conditions that the petitioner obtain the required certificate from
      the Pollution Control Board. It is stated that subsequently, the Pollution
      Control Board by a certificate dated 28.10.2011 had given the permission to
      the petitioner for setting up and operating the brick kiln industry.
      3.      The respondent Nos. 4 and 5 respectively are cultivators of the paddy
      fields in the areas surrounding the brick kiln. Their apprehension is that
      because of the operation of the brick kiln, pollution is being caused and
      because of the pollution, the productivity in their paddy fields are being
      adversely affected. Consequently, the said respondent Nos. 4 and 5 had
      preferred a writ petition before this Court being WP(C) No.1265/2012,
      wherein, the setting up of the brick kiln by the petitioner was assailed. It is
      also stated by the respondent Nos. 4 and 5 that adverse environmental
      situation would also arise in respect of the animals of the nearby Pabitara
      Wildlife Sanctuary.
      4.      It is noticeable that there are five brick kiln industries presently
      operating within the vicinity of the area and the respondent Nos. 4 and 5 had
      made a statement that they are affected only by the petitioner’s brick kiln and
      not by the others. The said WP(C) No.1265/2012 was disposed of by the
      judgment and order dated 28.10.2013, wherein in paragraph-24, it had been
      provided as such:-
              “[24]              In view of the aforesaid discussion, the writ petition
              is disposed of with the following directions:-
              (i)       The district administration, Morigaon as well as the PCB
              shall cause local verification and survey to ascertain as to whether
              setting up of the brick kiln over the land in question would cause
              any adverse affect on the surrounding and/or nearby land suitable
              for cultivation.
              (ii)      The    aforesaid   authorities,  in   association  with     the
              department of Environment & Forests, Government of Assam, shall
              also make local inspection to find out whether the land over which
              the permission to set up the brick kiln has been granted, falls within
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                                   Page 2 of 12

            1 Km radius from the periphery of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary,
            i.e. in the proposed ESZ.
            (iii)     If upon such inspection/survey, it is found that setting up of
            the brick kiln would have adverse affect on the surrounding and/or
            nearby land suitable for agriculture, or within the proposed ESZ,
            necessary order shall be passed by the Deputy Commissioner,
            Morigaon as well as by the Member Secretary, PCB, cancelling the
            aforesaid permissions dated 2nd September, 2011 and 20th
            October, 2011, granted by the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon and
            by the PCB, respectively.
            (iv)      In case, the aforesaid authorities find that there would not
            have any adverse environmental affect and the land in question is
            not within the proposed ESZ, as noticed above, necessary order
            shall be passed by the authorities. In that case, the PCB shall also
            ensure compliance of Entry-74 of Schedule-1 of 1986 Rules, before
            grant of “consent to operate”, apart from other provisions of the
            environmental laws. The PCB shall also, in every 3(three) months,
            make necessary inspection relating to the compliance of the
            different provisions of the environmental laws, apart from causing
            environmental pollution, if any, and shall pass necessary order, in
            accordance with law, if environmental pollution and/or violation of
            the provisions of the environmental law is found.
            (v)       The aforesaid exercise is directed to be completed within a
            period of 2(two) months from today.
            (vi)      The respondent No.11 shall not undertake any activity till
            the aforesaid decision is taken by the Deputy Commissioner as well
            as by the PCB.
            (vii)     The PCB shall, within 3(three) months from today, conduct
            inspection of all brick-kilns in the State of Assam to find out whether
            necessary permissions, as required under the relevant environmental
            laws, have been obtained, and whether those industries have
            complied with the requirements of law including the emission
            standard.      If not, necessary order(s), within 2(two) months
            thereafter, shall be passed by the PCB after giving opportunity of
            hearing to all concerned.
            (viii)    The Principal Secretary (Forests) to the Government of
            Assam, Environment & Forests Department shall, within a period of
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                                Page 3 of 12

              1(one) month from today, reply the communication dated 19th
              September, 2013 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of
              Environment & Forests (Wildlife Division), and if there is any lacuna
              in the proposal already submitted for declaration of ESZs, the same
              shall also be rectified and resubmitted within the aforesaid period of
              time.
              (ix)      The Government of India, Ministry of Environment & Forests
              (Wildlife Division), within 2(two) months thereafter, shall consider
              the proposal and pass necessary order with regard to issuance of
              notification constituting ESZs around the National Parks as well as
              the Wildlife Sanctuaries in the State of Assam.
              (x)       Till such consideration is made, no industry would be
              allowed to set up within the proposed ESZs around the National
              Parks as well as Wild Life Sanctuaries in the State of Assam.”
      5.      From Clause-(i) of paragraph-24 of the said judgment, it is noticeable
      that the district administration, Morigaon as well as the Pollution Control
      Board are required to cause a local verification and survey to ascertain as to
      whether the setting up of the brick kiln over the land in question would cause
      any adverse affect on the surrounding and or nearby land, which are used for
      agricultural purpose. Further, sub-clause-(iii) provides that if upon such
      inspection/ survey, it is found that the brick kiln would have adverse affect on
      the surrounding and/or nearby land suitable for agriculture, or within the
      proposed Eco-Sensitive-Zone, necessary order shall be passed by the Deputy
      Commissioner, Morigaon cancelling the permission dated 02.09.2011 granted
      to the petitioner and by the Member Secretary, PCB, cancelling the its
      permission dated 20.10.2011 granted to the petitioner. The requirement of
      Clause-(iii) of paragraph-24 of the judgment and order dated 12.10.2013 is
      that both the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon, being the head of the district
      administration and the Pollution Control Board shall cause a local verification
      and survey to ascertain whether setting up of the brick kiln would have any
      adverse affect on the nearby agricultural field.
      6.      The provisions that the aforesaid two authorities will cause local
      verification and survey is understood to mean that the appropriate experts
      acting under the said two authorities shall make a proper scientific
      assessment as to what adverse environmental impact the brick kiln would
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                                Page 4 of 12

      have when it is being operated. A verification or survey cannot be made by
      either of the two authorities when the brick kiln is not in operation as any
      such survey would give an incorrect result. Neither the authorities can arrive
      at a conclusion that it is having an adverse environmental affect nor the said
      authorities can arrive at a conclusion that it is having no such impact. The
      proper assessment can only be made when a definite scientific study is made
      over a given period of time by obtaining the necessary scientific data while
      the brick kiln is in operation and thereupon form an opinion whether any
      adverse impact has been caused upon the nearby agricultural field or not.
      7.       In Clause-(iv), (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x) of paragraph-24 of the aforesaid
      judgment of this Court deals with the effect that the existence brick kiln may
      have on the proposed Eco-Sensitive-Zone. Clause-(viii), clearly provides that
      the Principal Secretary (Forest) to the Government of Assam shall within one
      month respond to certain communication of the Government of India in the
      Ministry of Environmental and Forest, Wildlife Division and submit the
      required proposals and shall rectify and re-submit if there is any lacuna in the
      proposals, which are already submitted. The said direction is a general
      direction in respect of all such areas, which are declared to be Eco Sensitive
      Zone and does not confine to the area where the petitioner’s brick kiln is
      located. It has further been provided that till such consideration is made, no
      industry be allowed to be set up in the proposed Eco Sensitive Zone. Such
      direction in sub-clause (x) of paragraph-24 also gives an indication that this
      Court had prohibited that no further industry be allowed to be set up in the
      proposed Eco Sensitive Zone till a final consideration is made on the same.
      8.       Be that as it may, pursuant to the order dated 28.10.2013 in WP(C)
      No.1265/2012, the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon passed an order dated
      01.02.2014 had cancelled the permission dated 02.09.2011 granted in favour
      of the petitioner. It is noteworthy that while arriving in its conclusion to cancel
      the permission, the Deputy Commissioner in his order dated 01.02.2014 had
      relied upon (i) a report of the Divisional Forest Officer, Guwahati Wildlife
      Division, dated 24.12.2013, which provided that the petitioner’s brick kiln is
      located in the intermediate space between Burhamayong Reserve Forest and
      Pobitora Reserve Forest, both of which are part of Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary;
      (ii) a report of the Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control Board dated
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                                Page 5 of 12

      23.12.2013, which states that the brick kiln is not likely to cause any adverse
      affect on the agricultural productivity; (iii) a report of the District Agriculture
      Officer, Morigaon, which states that the brick kiln industry will cause
      significant drop in the productivity of Bodo Paddy and the temperature of the
      concerned area will increase, as a result of which the crops may be affected.
      9.      The said order of the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon was assailed by
      the writ petitioner in WP(C) No.927/2014, which was disposed of by the order
      dated 29.03.2016. In the said judgment and order, this Court had taken note
      of that by the earlier judgment and order dated 28.10.2013 in WP(C)
      No.1265/2012, the district administration, Morigaon and he authorities in the
      Pollution Control Board were directed to make local inspection to find out
      whether the land in question, involved in that case falls within 1 kilometer
      radius from the periphery of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and whether the
      setting up of the said brick kiln would have adverse affect on the surrounding
      and nearby land suitable for agriculture or as to whether it is within the
      proposed Eco Sensitive Zone. This Court accordingly arrived at a conclusion
      that the brick kiln of the petitioner is not located within 1 kilometer radius
      from the periphery of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and also that the same
      is not within the proposed 1 kilometer radius of the Eco Sensitive Zone of the
      Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. Accordingly, it was concluded that the Deputy
      Commissioner, Morigaon had committed an illegality in issuing the order of
      cancellation dated 01.02.2014, which in the view of this Court was not
      inconformity with the direction contained in the judgment and order dated
      28.10.2013. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon was required to
      pass a fresh reasoned order within a period of two months.
      10.     From the aforesaid judgment and order dated 29.03.2016, it is
      noticeable that firstly, there is a judicial finding of this Court that the
      petitioner’s brick kiln is not located within      1 kilometer radius from the
      periphery of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary nor it is within 1 kilometer radius
      of the Eco Sensitive Zone of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. The said
      conclusion of this Court gives a conclusive finding as regards the requirement
      of sub clause-(ii) of paragraph-24 of the judgment and order dated
      28.10.2013, which requires the district administration, Morigaon as well as the
      Pollution Control Board to arrive at a conclusion whether the brick kiln of the
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                             Page 6 of 12

      petitioner falls within 1 kilometer radius from the periphery of the Pobitora
      Wildlife Sanctuary or from the proposed Eco Sensitive Zone.
      11.     On the matter being so remanded, the Deputy Commissioner,
      Morigaon issued another order dated 03.06.2016, which is purportedly
      pursuant to the requirement of the judgment and order dated 29.03.2016 in
      WP(C) No.927/2014. By the said order dated 03.06.2016, the Deputy
      Commissioner by referring to paragraphs 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the judgment
      and order dated 29.03.2016 in WP(C) No.927/2014 had withdrawn the earlier
      order to examine and restored the earlier permission dated 02.09.2011
      granted in favour of the petitioner.
      12.     It is also noticeable that the said order of the Deputy Commissioner
      dated 03.06.2016 also did not meet the requirement of the direction of this
      Court in its judgment and order dated 29.03.2016 in WP(C) No.927/2014.
      13.     Be that as it may, the respondent No.4, namely, Sri Bharat Saikia had
      preferred a writ petition being WP(C) No.4589/2016 against the said order
      dated 03.06.2016 of the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon. By the judgment
      and order dated 05.08.2016 in WP(C) 4589/2016, the order dated 03.06.2016
      of the Deputy Commissioner was interfered and the Deputy Commissioner,
      Morigaon was directed to pass a fresh order strictly in accordance with the
      direction given by this Court in the order dated 28.10.2013 in WP(C)
      No.1265/2012.
      14.     Pursuant to the said order dated 05.08.2016 in WP(C) No.4589/2016,
      the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon passed the present impugned order
      dated 21.10.2016.
      15.     From the order dated 21.10.2016, it is noticeable that the Deputy
      Commissioner again refers to the same report of the Divisional Forest Officer
      dated 24.12.2013, report of the Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control
      Board dated 23.12.2013 and the report of the District Agriculture Officer
      dated 21.12.2013, which, as already stated hereinabove were the basis of the
      earlier order dated 01.02.2014, which was interfered by this Court by its
      judgment and order dated 29.03.2016 in WP(C) No.927/2014. On a reading of
      the order dated 21.10.2016, this Court finds that the Deputy Commissioner
      had not gone into any further aspect nor he had done any further verification
      or survey as required by the earlier judgment and order dated 28.10.2013 in
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                         Page 7 of 12

      WP(C) No.1265/2012. The Deputy Commissioner merely repeats what was
      provided in the earlier order dated 01.02.2014, which was interfered by this
      Court and does not make any endeavour to cause any verification and or
      survey as directed in the earlier order dated 28.10.2013 in WP(C)
      No.1265/2012.
      16.     Be that as it may, as the order of the Deputy Commissioner is based
      upon the report of the Divisional Forest Officer, Wildlife Division dated
      24.12.2013, the report of the Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control
      Board dated 23.12.2013 and the District Agriculture Officer dated 21.12.2013,
      this Court deems it appropriate that the aforesaid order be also taken into
      consideration to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the order of the Deputy
      Commissioner dated 21.10.2016 meets the requirement of the direction
      contained in the judgment and order dated 28.10.2013 in WP(C)
      No.1265/2012.
      17.     On a perusal of the report of the Divisional Forest Officer, Guwahati
      Wildlife Division, dated 24.12.2013, which is annexed as Annexure-14 to the
      writ petition, it can be seen that the same is a letter by the Divisional Forest
      Officer, Guwahati Wildlife Division addressed to the Deputy Commissioner,
      Morigaon purportedly pursuant to a letter of the Deputy Commissioner dated
      16.12.2013. The said letter of the Deputy Commissioner dated 16.12.2013
      requires the Divisional Forest Officer, Guwahati Wildlife Division to provide the
      specific data regarding the location of the petitioner’s brick kiln industry from
      the periphery boundary of the Burhamayong Reserve Forest and Pobitora
      Reserve Forest. Accordingly, in the said letter, the Divisional Forest Officer
      states that the distance of the petitioner’s brick kiln from the Burhamayong
      Reserve Forest is 1212 meters, whereas it is 2048.50 meters from the
      Pobitora Reserve Forest. But in clause-3 of the said letter, the Divisional
      Forest Officer, Guwahati Wildlife Division also states that the probable impact
      on flora and fauna of Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary can be ascertained by the
      Pollution Control Board. But at the same time, it was also provided that if the
      brick kiln site is enclosed by erecting permanent fencing/wall and as soon as
      industrial activity begins, then the traditional and natural trails used by rhinos
      and other wild animals for their movement, as it is required by them, shall get
      blocked.
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                             Page 8 of 12

      18.      It is noticeable that the said letter/report dated 24.12.2013 of the
      Divisional Forest Officer, Guwahati Wildlife Division does not indicate as to
      whether the said view was the personal view of the Divisional Forest Officer
      or it was a view expressed upon a scientific assessment of the ground reality
      that animals are using the location of the brick kiln of the petitioner as an
      animal corridor to pass from one reserve forest to another reserve forest.
      19.      From the report of the Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control
      Board dated 23.12.2013, which is annexed as Annexure-15, it is seen that the
      said authority had arrived at a conclusion that the operation of the brick kiln is
      not likely to cause any adverse affect on the agricultural productivity on the
      nearby agricultural field. It is also stated that the committee constituted for
      the purpose had made a joint physical verification on 18.11.2013 and
      19.11.2013.
      20.      Again the report of the District Agriculture Officer, which is annexed as
      Annexure-16 to the writ petition dated 21.12.2013, reveals that the probable
      impact on surrounding agricultural land is that after setting up of the brick
      kiln, the productivity of the Bodo Paddy of the adjacent agricultural land will
      significantly drop and the temperature of surrounding areas will increase as a
      result of which the crops may be affected. The said report was also based on
      a verification conducted on 19.12.2013.
      21.      Both the aforesaid reports of the Regional Executive Engineer,
      Pollution Control Board dated 23.12.2013 as well as the District Agriculture
      Officer, Morigaon dated 21.12.2013 are all based on one visit of the said
      officials to the site of the brick kiln. No indication is available either in the
      reports or in the form of any record that the said two officials had undertaken
      a scientific study of the actual impact of the brick kiln being operated. It
      appears that both the reports are on the basis of surmises and conjectures
      inasmuch as, the Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control Board says
      that “the brick kiln is not likely to cause any adverse affect” whereas the
      District Agriculture Officer states that “probable impact on surrounding
      agricultural land”. Both the aforesaid views are tentative views of the two
      respective authorities and the same are not substantiated by any definite
      scientific study being carried out.
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                             Page 9 of 12

      22.      In view of the above, neither the report/letter dated 24.12.2013 of the
      Divisional Forest Officer, Guwahati Wildlife Division, nor the report dated
      23.12.2013 of the Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control Board and
      the report dated 21.12.2013 of the District Agriculture Officer, Morigaon can
      be adjudicated to be an authentic basis to arrive at a conclusion that there
      are adverse environmental impact on the productivity of the surrounding
      agricultural field as a result of the operation of the brick kiln of the petitioner.
      The said reports can neither be a basis to arrive at a conclusion that there is
      no environmental affect nor it can be a basis to say that there is some
      environmental affect.
      23.      In such view of the matter, this Court is of the considered view that
      the order of the Deputy Commissioner, Morigaon dated 21.10.2016, by which
      the permission granted in favour of the petitioner’s brick kiln was cancelled is
      not sustainable.
      24.      From the said report of the Deputy Commissioner dated 21.10.2016, it
      is seen that the Deputy Commissioner had taken two independent and distinct
      aspects into consideration. One aspect is that the operation of the brick kiln is
      causing adverse environmental impact on the nearby agricultural fields and
      the other aspect is that the location of the brick kiln is adversely affecting the
      animal corridor between the Burhamayong Reserve Forest and Pobitora
      Reserve Forest, where both are said to be part of the Pobitora Wildlife
      Sanctuary.
      25.      As regards the aspect of there being adverse environmental impact on
      the neighbouring agricultural field, this Court deems it appropriate that the
      respective authorities being the District Agriculture Officer as well as the
      Regional Executive Engineer, Pollution Control Board undertake a proper
      scientific study on the impact of the operation of the brick kiln on the
      neighbouring agricultural field. The said scientific study can only be done by
      following the procedure that the respective authorities will record the
      environmental parameters over the agricultural field for a given period of time
      when the brick kiln is not in operation. Thereafter, the said authority would
      take the required scientific data on the environmental parameters over a
      given period of time when the brick kiln is actually in operation. In the
      absence of such scientific data, it can neither be said that the operation of the
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                              Page 10 of 12

      brick kiln is having some adverse environmental impact on the neighbouring
      agricultural field nor it can be said that it does not have any such impact.
      26.      Accordingly, it is directed that both the aforesaid officers shall make a
      joint verification and survey and record the parameters for a period of seven
      continuous days when the brick kiln is not in operation. Thereafter the
      authorities shall allow the brick kiln to be operated for a period of one month
      and after the brick kiln operates for three weeks, the aforesaid two authorities
      shall record the environmental parameters for seven continuous days being
      the fourth week of running the brick kiln industry.
      27.      Upon arriving at the aforesaid facts and figures, the authorities shall
      make a scientific assessment as to what such environmental parameters
      during the period when the brick kiln is in operation would have on the
      neighbouring agricultural fields. To arrive at such conclusion, the District
      Agriculture Officer shall provide the required information as to what is the
      normal level of environmental parameters, to which the crops in question can
      be subjected to.
      28.      As regards the other aspect that the brick kiln may adversely affect
      the animal corridor in its movement from the Burhamayong Reserve Forest to
      the Pobitora Reserve Forest, the appropriate authorities in the Wildlife
      Department, being the Chief Wildlife Warden of the Pobitora Wildlife
      Sanctuary shall make a scientific study on the animal movement in the vicinity
      of the area where the petitioner brick kiln is located. By a scientific study, it is
      understood that the Chief Wildlife Warden will make a survey as to the exact
      number of animal that passes through the area over a given period of time.
      Accordingly, the Chief Wildlife Warden shall form a report based upon such
      scientific input as to whether the existence of the brick kiln in its present
      location would adversely affect the animal corridor, if any.
      29.      As regards the setting up of the Eco Sensitive Zone, the appropriate
      authorities in the Ministry of Environmental Forest, Government of India as
      well as the appropriate officials in the Forest and Environment Department of
      the Government of Assam shall form an opinion regarding setting up of the
      Eco Sensitive Zone and also the likely impact and the restrictions that may
      have to be put in place on the activities of the existing inhabitants within the
      proposed Eco Sensitive Zone. Also in the event, the authorities are of the view
WP(C) No.7048 of 2016                                                              Page 11 of 12

      that the petitioner’s brick kiln would be located within the Eco Sensitive Zone,
      all such restrictions that may be imposed, shall be done in a free and fair
      manner and only upon a scientific assessment being made justifying its
      requirement. In other words, in the event, the authorities are of the view that
      the concerned area is to be included either in an Eco Sensitive Zone or in a
      proposed Eco Sensitive Zone, a definite guideline and parameter shall be
      evolved stating as to what kind of activities can take place within such Eco
      Sensitive Zone and the authorities shall act strictly in terms of such guidelines
      and parameters.
      30.     It is provided that the required exercise of the Regional Executive
      Engineer, Pollution Control Board as well as the District Agriculture Officer, as
      indicated above, be preferably carried out within a period of three months
      from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this judgment and order.
      31.     It is provided that after the said authorities completes the scientific
      study when the brick field is not in operation, they shall inform the petitioner
      and accordingly the respondent authorities shall allow the petitioner to
      operate the brick kiln. The continuance of the operation of the brick kiln shall
      be subject to the final order that the Deputy Commissioner as well as
      Pollution Control Board may pass after undertaking the aforesaid scientific
      study, which shall be done within a period of three months from the date of
      receipt of a certified copy of this judgment and order.
              In terms of the above, the writ petition stands closed.
                                                                             JUDGE
