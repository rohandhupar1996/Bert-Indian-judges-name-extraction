               (4) A person guilty of an offence under this
               Section shall be punishable with imprisonment for
               a term which may extend to three years, or with
               fine, or with both.‖
16.    Section 3(1)(c) stipulates that offence as defined under section 3(1)(c)
if relates to ―work of defence, arsenal, naval, military or air force
establishment or station, mine, minefield, factory, dockyard, camp, ship or
aircraft or otherwise in relation to the naval, military or air force affairs of
Govt., in or relation to any secret official code‖, is punishable with
imprisonment which may extend to 14 years and in other cases to three
years. In the impugned order dated 16.10.2012, the ld. Additional Sessions
Judge has proceeded on the premise that allegations in the complaint/charge-
sheet are not covered within the ambit of above words of Section 3(1)(c) and
the offence is punishable by imprisonment which may extend to 3 years.
Even before this court, it is not contended by CBI that the present case
would be covered by the ambit of above words of section 3(1)(c) of the Act
and would be punishable by imprisonment, which would be anything more
than 3 years. Section 5(1)(2) and (4) of the Act reproduced above show that
all the accused persons in the present case have been charged for the offence
which are punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
three years or with fine or with both.
17.    Insofar as accused Niraj Kumar is concerned, it is contended on his
behalf that the case of the prosecution is based on conjectures. It is
contended that there is no direct or circumstantial evidence capable of being
converted into legal evidence against this accused to show that he had
passed on the copy of minutes dated 29.9.1999 to accused Aniruddha Behal
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                          Page 9 of 28

or any other person.           It is submitted that material on record filed by
prosecution itself shows that accused Niraj Kumar was transferred from the
concerned seat from North Block to Sardar Patel Bhawan on 12.10.1999
and thereafter he handed over the custody of the file to one Ratti Ram, PW
who has been made a prosecution witness in this case. Reference is made to
the statement of Rati Ram, PW recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
18.    It is contended that after handing over the charge accused Niraj
Kumar ceased to be the custodian of the relevant file.              The    alleged
publication on the site took place about a year from the date of handing over
the charge by the said accused. It is also contended that the case of the
prosecution against the accused Niraj Kumar is entirely based on alleged
confessional statement purportedly recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. It is submitted
that the statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. is hit by the provisions of section 24 of the
Indian Evidence Act.            It is also submitted that the said statement was
withdrawn by this accused. In any event, it is submitted that the statement
was never recorded as per provisions of section 164 Cr.P.C. There is no
provision or procedure for taking on record the pre-recorded statement by
way of statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. Reference in this regard was made to the
provisions of Chapter 13 Rule 4 of Delhi High Court Rules which stipulates
that statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C must be reduced in writing either by the
Magistrate. It is also contended that tenor of this document itself shows that
the accused Niraj Kumar had made the alleged statement in the hope of
being granted pardon and an application u/s 306 Cr.P.C was moved for
being made an approver as is apparent from the order dated 17 th March,
2011 of the ld.trial court which was never done.
19.    Learned counsel for the petitioner-Niraj Kumar has submitted that in
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                             Page 10 of 28

the impugned order, the ld.trial court has referred to the statement of Ratti
Ram, PW who in his statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C has stated that he was told by
one Mohan that accused Niraj Kumar had made photocopies of the
documents after his transfer from the seat but the statement of Mohan has
not been recorded. Even the statement of          Ratti Ram, PW against the
accused Niraj Kumar, at best, is in the nature of hearsay evidence.
20.    Learned counsel for the petitioner-Niraj Kumar has further contended
that alleged statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C was printed text supplied by
the respondent-CBI that was incorrectly taken on record by the ld.trial
court. It is contended that the alleged confessional statement was extracted
by the respondent on the inducement of being declared as an approver
which inducement had been offered fraudulently and with malafide
intention. It is further contended that the alleged statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C
was not recorded as per Delhi High Court Rules (Section 4 of Chapter 13
Vol.III of the Delhi High Court Rules). It is contended that the alleged
statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C was not recorded by the Magistrate or under the
dictation of the Magistrate. There is no provision to tender a typed copy
under section 164 Cr.P.C as has been done in the present case.
21.    The complaint is filed on the basis of alleged documents i.e., minutes
of the meeting dated 29.9.1999 and report that is said to have been
electronically published on the site, tehelka.com.        However, the said
documents are not supported by any certificate under Section 65B of the
Evidence Act, 1862, to show that the document is a correct representation of
an electronic document as alleged by the CBI.
22.    Learned counsel for the petitioner-Aniruddha Bahal has submitted
that prosecution has failed to prima facie establish that the alleged minutes
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                         Page 11 of 28

of the meeting dated 29.9.1999 were ever published on the website of
Tehalka.com. In the alternate, it is contended that as per case of the
prosecution the minutes were posted on the website on 9.10.2000 and were
removed therefrom on 10.10.2000 i.e., very next day. It is submitted that it
is not the case of prosecution that this petitioner was guided by any
consideration except to place the matter before public domain in discharge
of his obligations as a journalist.         It is submitted that the document dated
29.9.1999 cannot be considered as a secret document and in any event, the
present petitioner cannot be imputed with the knowledge of the fact that this
document was a secret document.                 It is contended that this document
nowhere bears any endorsement to the effect that it is a secret document. It
is also argued that even if it is presumed that it was a part of file which was
marked ‗secret‘, there is nothing on record to show that petitioner was aware
of the said fact.
23.    It is further contended that the case of prosecution is solely based on
the purported statement recorded u/s 164 of Cr.P.C. which is liable to be
ignored for the reason as argued on behalf of Niraj Kumar. Moreover, at
best, the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. is in the nature of confessional
statement by the co-accused who is being tried along with other co-accused
persons and thus has no significance against the present petitioner.
24.    It is further contended that the ld. C.M.M. erred in taking cognizance
of the offences on the basis of challan in view of the provisions of section
13(3) of the Act. It is contended that the Act is a complete code in itself. It
would not be open to the ld.C.M.M. to take cognizance of the offence except
on the basis of complaint and the material attached to the complaint. It is
further contended that power to file complaint under section 13(3) of the Act
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                               Page 12 of 28

only vests with the appropriate government or some officer empowered by
the appropriate government in his behalf. It is contended that the complaint
dated 4.6.2003 filed by the Deputy Superintendent of Police Shri
N.S.Kharayat, CBI was thus incompetent. It is also contended that the
Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs who himself was a delegate of the
Central Government, could not have delegated the power under section
13(3) of the Act to file the complaint.
25.    Insofar as the co-accused Thomas Mathew is concerned, it is
contended that there is no material against him which gives rise to grave
suspicion against the accused for commission of alleged offences. It is
contended that the case against him is also based on the alleged confessional
statement of co-accused Niraj Kumar purported to have been recorded u/s
164 Cr.P.C which is liable to be rejected for the reasons noted above. The
charge sheet or the complaint does not mention anything about his
involvement or that he had any knowledge of the publication of the alleged
offending material.
26.    In substance, the contention of learned counsel for the accused
persons is that there is no sufficient material on record to justify framing of
charge against them and for taking cognizance, as such, the order of
framing charge is liable to be set aside.
27.    Learned counsel for the respondent-CBI has argued to the contrary. It
is submitted that there is sufficient material to justify the framing of charge
against the accused persons. Attention of this court was drawn to the order
dated 13.5.2010 passed by this court in Crl.M.C.1637/2010 wherein the
revision petition filed by the accused -Niraj Kumar against the complaint/
charge sheet was withdrawn reserving liberty to the petitioner/accused
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                           Page 13 of 28

Niraj Kumar to take all the pleas taken in the said revision petition before
the ld.trial court at the time of hearing arguments on the point of charge. It
is also submitted that evidential value of confessional statement recorded by
the ld.M.M. can be better looked into after recording of evidence by the
ld.trial court.
28.     It is contended that so called ―retraction‖ is belated      and is an
afterthought and of no value in the eyes of law. It is further contended that
the so called ―retraction‖ has not diluted prima facie evidence against the
petitioner Niraj Kumar and other co-accused persons.
29.     It is contended that the ld.C.M.M. has rightly taken the cognizance on
the basis of complaint and charge sheet filed against the accused persons
since both arise out of one FIR and there is no illegality in the order dated
15.6.2005.
30.     It is submitted that the accused Aniruddha Bahal was not only the
Director of      accused company but also Editor of the Portal. It is further
submitted that as per statement of co-accused Niraj Kumar recorded u/s 164
Cr.P.C, specific role has been attributed to the accused Aniruddha Bahal, as
such, he cannot escape from the responsibility of publishing the material in
question by claiming that he had no knowledge about the commission of
offence under the Act. It is submitted that charge can be framed on the basis
of strong suspicion. Reference is made to the judgment in Sajjan Kumar Vs.
CBI 2011 Crl.L.J.1225SC and Nakul Kohli vs. State 2010 Crl.L.J.4536.
31.     It is contended that there is sufficient evidence against the accused
persons both oral and documentary, as such, charge has been rightly framed
against them and the revision petitions are liable to be dismissed.
32.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                          Page 14 of 28

on record.
33.    I find that there is substantial force in the submissions made on behalf
of accused persons that respondent-CBI could not have proceeded to file
charge sheet in the present case.
34.    The Official Secrets Act is a special Act and by virtue of section 4 and
5 of the Cr.P.C., any trial under the Official Secrets Act would be governed
by the procedure as laid down by the Official Secrets Act.
       Section 13(3) of the Official Secrets Act is as follows:-
               ―13. Restriction on trial of offences
                      ...................................................
               (3) No Court shall take cognizance of any offence
               under this Act, unless upon complaint made by order
               of, or under authority from, the appropriate
               Government or some officer empowered by the
               appropriate Government in this behalf.‖
35.    The term ‗complaint‘ vide Section 2 (d) of Cr.P.C. means any
allegation, made orally or in writing, to a Magistrate with a view to his
taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or
unknown, has committed an offence, but does not include a police report.
36.    The term ‗police report‘ is defined in Section 2 (r) of Cr.P.C. as
follows:-
               ―2(r) ―police report‖ means a report forwarded by
               a police officer to a Magistrate under sub-section
               (2) of section 173‖
37.    Thus, the term ‗complaint‘ and ‗police report‘ have different meaning
and connotation. In this case, the CBI initially filed the complaint under
Section 13(3) of the Act, thereafter, proceeded to file a charge sheet under
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                               Page 15 of 28

Section 173 Cr.P.C. In the order dated 15.6.2005 the learned CMM has
referred to challan and the complaint under Section 13(3) of the Act. Thus,
it would appear that the learned CMM took cognizance of the offence based
on the police complaint and the charge sheet. Moreover, the learned CMM
vide order dated 7.7.2005 also ordered that the complaint filed under Section
13(3) of Act and the charge sheet be clubbed together as per law.
38.    Learned CMM has not referred to the law by which complaint under
Section 13(3) of Act and Section 173 of Cr.P.C. were liable to be clubbed
together. However, it may be that the learned CMM had the provisions of
Section 210 Cr.P.C. in her mind.
39.    Section 210 of Cr.P.C. reads as follows:-
               ―210. Procedure to be followed when there is a
               complaint case and police investigation in
               respect of the same offence.-(1) When in a case
               instituted otherwise than on a police report
               (hereinafter referred to as a complaint case), it is
               made to appear to the Magistrate, during the
               course of the inquiry or trial held by him, that an
               investigation by the police is in progress in relation
               to the offence which is the subject-matter of the
               inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall
               stay the proceedings of such inquiry or trial and
               call for a report on the matter from the police
               officer conducting the investigation.
                       (2) If a report is made by the investigating
               police officer under section 173 and on such report
               cognizance of any offence is taken by the
               Magistrate against any person who is an accused in
               the complaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire
               into or try together the complaint case and the case
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                           Page 16 of 28

               arising out of the police report as if both the cases
               were instituted on a police report.
                       (3) If the police report does not relate to any
               accused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate
               does not take cognizance of any offence on the
               police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or
               trial, which was stayed by him, in accordance with
               the provisions of this Code.‖
40.    Provisions of Section 210 Cr.P.C. would have no applicability to the
trial of offences under the Act. Under Section 13(3) of the Act reproduced
above, no court can take cognizance of an offence under the Act unless upon
complaint made by order of, or under authority from appropriate
Government or some officer empowered by the appropriate Government in
this behalf.
41.    The Official Secrets Act is a Special Act and a complete code in itself.
As per the mandate of the Official Secrets Act, no Court shall take
cognizance in the absence of a ‗complaint‘ filed under authority of the
Appropriate Government. Therefore a ‗complaint‘ as defined under Section
2(d) of the Code, and the authority of the Appropriate Government for filing
the complaint for the offence committed under the Official Secrets Act, if
any, are the sine qua non for taking cognizance of any offence under the
Act.
42.    In this regard, reference can be made to Section 22 of the
Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 [―TOHO‖]. The same is as
under:-
           ―22. Cognizance of offence. –
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                            Page 17 of 28

            (1) No court shall take cognizance of an offence under
                this Act except on a complaint made by –
           (a) the Appropriate Authority concerned, or any
                officer authorised in this behalf by the Central
                Government or the State Government or, the case
                may be, the Appropriate Authority; or
           (b) a person who has given notice of not less than
                sixty days, in such manner as may be prescribed,
                to the Appropriate Authority concerned, of the
                alleged offence and of his intention to make a
                complaint to the court.
            (2) No court other than that of a Metropolitan
                Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class
                shall try any offence punishable under this Act.
            (3) Where a complaint has been made under clause (b)
                of sub-section (1), the court may, on demand by
                such person, direct the Appropriate Authority to
                make available copies of the relevant records in its
                possession to such person.‖
43.   The Supreme Court in the case of Jeewan Kumar Raut vs CBI; AIR
2009 SC 2763 while dealing with the provisions of Section 22 of TOHO
held as follows:-
                ―12. TOHO is a special Act. It deals with the
                subjects mentioned therein, viz., offences relating
                to removal of human organs, etc. Having regard to
                the importance of the subject only, enactment of
                the said regulatory statute was imperative. TOHO
                provides for appointment of an appropriate
                authority to deal with the matters specified in Sub-
                section (3) of Section 13 thereof. By reason of the
                aforementioned provision, an appropriate authority
                has specifically been authorized inter alia to
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                            Page 18 of 28

               investigate any complaint of the breach of any of
               the provisions of TOHO or any of the rules made
               thereunder and take appropriate action.
               13. The Appropriate Authority, subject to
               exceptions provided for in TOHO, thus, is only
               authorized to investigate cases of breach of any of
               the provisions thereof, whether penal or otherwise.
               Ordinarily, any person can set the criminal law in
               motion. The Parliament and the State Legislatures,
               however, keeping in view the sensitivity and/ or
               importance of the subject, have carved out specific
               areas where violations of any of the provisions of a
               special statute like TOHO can be dealt with only
               by the authorities specified therein.
               14. The FIR lodged before the officer incharge of
               the Gurgaon Police Station was by way of
               information. It disclosed not only commission of
               an offence under TOHO but also under various
               provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The officer
               incharge of the Police Station, however, was not
               authorized by the appropriate government to deal
               with the matter in relation to TOHO; but, the
               respondent was. In that view of the matter, the
               investigation of the said complaint was handed
               over to it.
               15. TOHO being a special statute, Section 4 of the
               Code, which ordinarily would be applicable for
               investigation into a cognizable offence or the other
               provisions, may not be applicable. Section 4
               provides for investigation, inquiry, trial, etc.
               according to the provisions of the Code. Sub-
               section (2) of Section 4, however, specifically
               provides that offences under any other law shall be
               investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise
               dealt with according to the same provisions, but
               subject to any enactment for the time being in
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                         Page 19 of 28

               force regulating the manner or place of
               investigating, inquiring into, tried or otherwise
               dealing with such offences. TOHO being a special
               Act and the matter relating with offences
               thereunder having been regulated by reason of the
               provisions thereof, there cannot be any manner of
               doubt whatsoever that the same shall prevail over
               the provisions of the Code.
               xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
               xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
               19. Section 22 of TOHO prohibits taking of
               cognizance except on a complaint made by an
               appropriate authority or the person who had made
               a complaint earlier to it a laid down therein.
               Respondent, although, has all the powers of an
               investigating agency, it expressly has been
               statutorily prohibited from filing a police report. It
               could file a complaint petition only as an
               appropriate authority so as to comply with the
               requirements contained in Section 22 of TOHO. If
               by reason of the provisions of TOHO, filing of a
               police report by necessary implication is
               necessarily forbidden, the question of its
               submitting a report in terms of Sub-section (2) of
               Section 173 of the Code did not and could not
               arise. In other words, if no police report could be
               filed, Sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code
               was not attracted.
               20. It is a well-settled principle of law that if a
               special statute lays down procedures, the ones laid
               down under the general statutes shall not be
               followed. In a situation of this nature, the
               respondent could carry out investigations in
               exercise of its authorization under Section
               13(3)(iv) of TOHO. While doing so, it could
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                           Page 20 of 28

               exercise such powers which are otherwise vested
               in it. But, as it could not file a police report but a
               complaint petition only; Sub-section (2) of Section
               167 of the Code may not be applicable. The
               provisions of the Code, thus, for all intent and
               purport, would apply only to an extent till conflict
               arises between the provisions of the Code and
               TOHO and as soon as the area of conflict reaches,
               TOHO shall prevail over the Code. Ordinarily,
               thus, although in terms of the Code, the respondent
               upon completion of investigation and upon
               obtaining remand of the accused from time to time,
               was required to file a police report, it was
               precluded from doing so by reason of the
               provisions contained in Section 22 of TOHO. To
               put it differently, upon completion of the
               investigation, an authorized officer could only file
               a complaint and not a police report, as a specific
               bar has been created by the Parliament. In that
               view of the matter, the police report being not a
               complaint and vice-versa, it was obligatory on the
               part of the respondent to choose the said method
               invoking the jurisdiction of the Magistrate
               concerned for taking cognizance of the offence
               only in the manner laid down therein and not by
               any other mode. The procedure laid down in
               TOHO, thus, would report the respondent to file a
               complaint and not a report which course of action
               could have been taken recourse to but for the
               special provisions contained in Section 22 of
               TOHO.‖
                                            (emphasis added).
44.    The position under the Official Secrets Act is also similar to the
position under TOHO. Here also the law prohibits the filing of charge sheet
by implication.
45.    In these circumstances, taking cognizance of the offence and the
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                           Page 21 of 28

directions to club the charge sheet and the complaint by the learned CMM
cannot be sustained.
46.    I also find substance in the submission of accused persons that there
was no sufficient material on record to frame the charge against the accused
persons.
47.    Accused Niraj Kumar is facing trial for handing over the copy of the
minutes dated 29.9.1999 to other co-accused persons. As per respondent,
accused Niraj Kumar was custodian of the relevant file till 12.10.1999 and
thereafter was transferred to Sardar Patel Bhawan. After 12.10.1999, this
accused ceased to be the custodian of the relevant file. The files were then
in the custody of Ratti Ram, PW. Other than the statement of accused Niraj
Kumar under Section 164 Cr.P.C., to which the reference shall be made later
on, there is no statement of any other person on record to show that the
accused Niraj Kumar had obtained copy of the minutes either before or
thereafter. In his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., Ratti Ram, PW has
referred to the statement of one Mohan but the statement of Mohan, if
recorded, has not been filed.             Mr.S.P.Shokhanda, PW Under Secretary
(Vigilance), Ministry of Home Affairs, North Block, New Delhi in his
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was asked the reasons for assuming
that the information could have been leaked by accused Niraj Kumar and the
sole reason given by this witness for making this assumption is that the
accused was dealing with the file containing the minutes of the meeting
dated 29.9.1999 before his transfer on 12.10.1999. However, no reason is
assigned by any of the witnesses as to why only this person is being doubted
for allegedly having disclosed the minutes to other persons.         Even the
statement of Mr.G.K.Pillai, Joint Secretary (NE), MHA, PW and Harish
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                         Page 22 of 28

Chandra Prakash, PW recorded u/s 161 Cr.P.C are of no help to respondent.
48.    The prosecution next relies on the confessional statement of Niraj
Kumar recorded by the learned MM under Section 164 Cr.P.C. The counsel
for all the accused persons has challenged the statement recorded under
Section 164 Cr.P.C. as illegal and of no legal consequence. The statement
referred to in the statement recorded by learned MM is a typed statement
which runs into 9 pages.             Section 164(4) Cr.P.C. lays down that any
confession shall be recorded in the manner provided in Section 281 of that
Code for the recording of examination of accused and shall be signed by the
person making the confession.
       Section 164(4) of Cr.P.C. is reproduced as under:-
               “164. Recording of confessions and statements:-
               ...
               (4) Any such confession shall be recorded in the
               manner provided in section 281 for recording the
               examination of an accused person and shall be
               signed by the person making the confession; and
               the Magistrate shall make a memorandum at the
               foot of such record to the following effect:-
                       “I have explained to (name) that he is not
                       bound to make a confession and that, if he
                       does so, any confession he may make may
                       be used as evidence against him and I
                       believe that this confession was voluntarily
                       made. It was taken in my presence and
                       hearing, and was read over to the person
                       making it and admitted by him to be correct,
                       and it contains a full and true account of the
                       statement made by him.
                                            (Signed) AB Magistrate”

49.   Section 281 Cr.P.C. provides as under:-“281. Record of examination
of accused:-
               (1) Whenever the accused is examined by a
               Metropolitan Magistrate, the Magistrate shall make
               a memorandum of the substance of the
               examination of the accused in the language of the
               Court and such memorandum shall be signed by
               the Magistrate and shall form part of the record.
               (2) Whenever the accused is examined by any
               Magistrate other than a Metropolitan Magistrate,
               or by a Court of Session, the whole of such
               examination, including every question put to him
               and every answer given by him, shall be recorded
               in full by the Presiding Judge or Magistrate
               himself or where he is unable to do so owing to a
               physical or other incapacity, under his direction
               and superintendence by an officer of the Court
               appointed by him in this behalf.
               (3) The record shall, if practicable, be in the
               language in which the accused is examined or, if
               that is not practicable in the language of the Court.
               (4) The record shall be shown or read to the
               accused, or, if he does not understand the language
               in which it is written, shall be interpreted to him in
               a language which he understands, and he shall be
               at liberty to explain or add to his answers.
               (5) It shall thereafter be signed by the accused and
               by the Magistrate or Presiding Judge, who shall
               certify under his own hand that the examination
               was taken in his presence and hearing and that the
               record contains a full and true account of the
               statement made by the accused.
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                           Page 24 of 28

               (6) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
               apply to the examination of an accused person in
               the course of a summary trial.”
50.    Thus, there is a clear indication in the section that the statement under
Section 164 Cr.P.C. should be got recorded by the Magistrate either in his or
her own handwriting or should be dictated to some person and pre-recorded
statement would not normally suffice. Moreover, Section 4 of Chapter 13
Vol. III of Delhi High Court Rules also state that in recording a statement or
confession under Section 164 Cr.P.C., the provisions of that section and
provision of Section 281 Cr.P.C. should be strictly followed by the court
concerned.
51.    The material on record would also show that the statement in issue
was made by accused Niraj Kumar in the hope of being made an approver in
this case. There is an application on record moved by accused Niraj Kumar
under Section 306 Cr.P.C. dated 9.1.2006 for grant of pardon and for
making him approver of the case.            There is another application dated
9.7.2006 under Section 306 Cr.P.C. by respondent for grant of pardon to
Niraj Kumar. There are deletions and improvements made in the statement.
The accused Niraj Kumar was ultimately not made an approver. Those
applications remained pending for a long time. On 18.4.2011 Niraj Kumar
had moved two applications, one seeking withdrawal of statement u/s 164
Cr.P.C and the other for withdrawal application of application u/s 306
Cr.P.C. The application seeking withdrawal of application u/s 306 Cr.P.C
was not opposed by respondent. Accordingly, the said application was
allowed by ld.trial court on 20.4.2012. In the application for withdrawal of
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                            Page 25 of 28

statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. Niraj Kumar has stated that at the time
of making the alleged statement he was in custody and not on bail. He was
also under suspension from his job. Considering his situation, petitioner
was given assurance that he would be made a witness in the said case and
that all criminal charges against him would be dropped and he would be
reinstated in his job and pressurised him to submit a printed text before the
ld. M.M. In these circumstances, I find considerable force in the submission
of the petitioner that the alleged statement was got signed and he was made
to submit to Ld. M.M. In such circumstances, I concur with the counsel for
accused persons that it would be unjust if prosecution is permitted to rely on
the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. for framing the charge against all
the accused persons.
52.    There is no other prima facie evidence available against accused Niraj
Kumar.
53.    Insofar as Aniruddha Bahal is concerned, the prosecution was
required to produce material that the minutes of meeting dated 29.9.1999
were published on the website tehelka.com and the same was with the
knowledge of accused Aniruddha Bahal. There is no evidence that the
minutes of meeting dated 29.9.1999 were displayed on the website. Section
65 B of the Evidence Act lays down the procedure for admissibility of
electronic records. Though more than 13 years have passed, the prosecution
has not filed any certificate under Section 65B. It is stated that Sh. Prakash
Shokhanda, Under Secretary (Vigilance), MHA, stated that the information
was downloaded by the then MHA website incharge but statement of
website incharge was not got recorded nor any certificate obtained. In any
event there is no material to show that accused Aniruddha Bahal had the
CRL.REV.P. Nos.683/2012, 707/2012 & 34/2013                         Page 26 of 28

knowledge of the fact that minutes were secret document and there was no
marking of secret on that document.
54.     It has also been argued on behalf of accused Aniruddha Bahal that
time and again it held by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court that the vicarious
liability cannot be attached upon the directors and managing directors of a
company just by the virtue of them being directors or managing directors.
The basic requirement of impleading a director is to show that the said
director was responsible for the day to day affairs of the company. It has to
be clearly stated what the role of the director was in the alleged commission
of offence and secondly whether the said role was attributable to such
criminal intent and intention.           It is argued that the absence of specific
averments in regard to the role and manner of involvement of the director
cannot in any circumstance fasten any liability on the said director.
However, but I need not go into all this in view of the fact that there is no
sufficient evidence to frame charge against this accused.
55.     Against Thomas Mathew again there is no evidence other than alleged
confessional statement under Section 164 of accused Niraj Kumar to which
reference has already been made.
56.     Prima facie there is no material which shows grave suspicion against
the accused Thomas Mathew also for commission of any of alleged
offences.
57.    In view of above discussion, the order on charge dated 16th October,
2012 passed by the ld.Addl. Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court (Central), Tis
Hazari, Delhi and the charge framed vide aforesaid order          in FIR i.e., RC
No.1(S)/2001/SIC.IV            New     Delhi      dated    30.3.2001  against    the
petitioners/accused persons are set aside. The petitioners stand discharged

in the present case.
       Revision petitions stand disposed of accordingly.
       Trial court record be sent back.
