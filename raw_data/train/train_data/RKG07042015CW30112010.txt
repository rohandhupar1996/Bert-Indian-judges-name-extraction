   1. The petition is directed against an order of the Debt Recovery
      Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) dated 10.3.2010. The impugned order
      had affirmed the order of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) which
      had rejected the application for setting aside of a decree made by that
      Tribunal earlier on 29.9.2008.      The petitioner was arrayed as a
      respondent in the DRT in the earlier proceedings.
   2. The brief facts are that the first defendant in the proceedings before
      DRT M/s Vega Clocks Pvt. Ltd., had availed credit facilities to the
      tune of Rs.1.36 crores from the bank. The second defendant was one
      of its Directors. The third defendant was the petitioner, a company,
      and was arrayed as a party since it had furnished a guarantee to secure
WPC 3011/2010                                                                 Page 1

      the loan. The default of the borrower led to the initiation of recovery
      proceedings before the DRT ultimately. During the proceedings the
      present petitioner was not represented. Apparently, the DRT had
      issued noticed despite which there was no appearance. Ultimately the
      final order was passed on 29.8.2008 ex-parte against all the
      defendants therein.
   3. It was in these circumstances that the petitioner approached the DRT
      with an application to set aside the ex-parte order/decree being MA
      No.63/09. The DRT after issuing notice to the bank and the other
      respondents was of the opinion that the record disclosed that one Sh.
      P C Chopra had filed Vakalatnama on behalf of defendants. Taking
      note of this and that said counsel was appearing in the proceedings, it
      was of the view that no sufficient cause was shown to set aside the
      ex-parte order. It was also held that validity of mortgage could not
      have been looked into by the DRT in proceedings which were
      miscellaneous proceedings.         Nevertheless, it did consider the
      submissions of the writ petitioner and rejected them. The DRAT by
      the impugned order affirmed this decision. The record of proceedings
      before this Court portrays a very dismal picture. Right from end of
      2011, the petitioner kept on seeking adjournment. The order dated
      04.11.2011 directed that service be effected on respondents 3A to 3D
      on the ground that respondents 3A to 3D would be impleaded since
      they are the legal representatives of the directors. It was submitted
      that liabilities arose on the basis of the directorâ€™s acts. On 18.7.2012
      the Court recorded that the respondent No.3A to 3D had proposed to
      the bank for a settlement and posted the matter to 21.8.2012. Furthers
WPC 3011/2010                                                             Page 2

      orders dated 16.10.2012, 3.12.2012, 21.2.2013, 17.5.2013, 4.9.2013,
      18.11.2013 and 11.2.2014 reveal that repeated adjournments were
      sought. On 19.3.2014, request was made that dispute be referred to
      Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre, which the Court
      did on the very same day. Thereafter, adjournment was sought and
      granted repeatedly on 12.5.2014, 28.7.2014, 24.9.2014 and again on
      27.11.2014, 16.1.2015 and 11.3.2015. The order dated 16.1.2015
      recorded that respondent 3A had to come to India from the United
      States and was likely to be in the city on 3.2.2015. The Court in the
      circumstances adjourned the matter to 11.3.2015. On that date again
      a request was made for adjournment. However, this Court noticed
      that the matter was lingering for quite a while and directed the
      Secretary, Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre to file
      a report as to the number of opportunities granted to the parties to
      arrive at a settlement. That report is not on record since the registry
      has not communicated the order. We have considered the entire facts
      and are of the opinion that there is no infirmity with the order of the
      DRAT which took into consideration the materials in concluding that
      no sufficient cause has been shown for setting aside the final order
      dated 29.8.2008. Having regard to the fact that the disputes in this
      case were unnecessarily protracted and appeared to have prolonged
      further on account of mediation (which are essentially meant to arrive
      at just and mutually acceptable solution early), the Court is of the
      opinion that the order in this case should be marked to the Delhi High
      Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre to ensure that when matters
      are referred for mediation, proceedings in mediation are not used as a
WPC 3011/2010                                                           Page 3

       pretext to prolong the case before the Court itself and are preferably
       concluded within a definite time span. The curious result in this case
       has been that mediation proceedings have acquired greater primacy
       over the Court proceedings, which have at least yielded to mediation
       proceedings. In view of the conclusions recorded by the DRAT on
       merits this Court finds no merit in interfering with the order of the
       DRAT and the appeal is accordingly dismissed.
    4. Learned counsel says that he has a cheque for the amount agreed
       upon by the bank and that the same may be directed to be accepted. It
       is up to the bank to accept the terms of settlement in accordance with
       the agreement arrived at by the parties. Copy of the order shall be
       marked to the concerned Registrar for appropriate action against the
       concerned officers given that they did not forward copy of the
       previous order of this Court to the Delhi High Court Mediation and
       Conciliation Centre.
