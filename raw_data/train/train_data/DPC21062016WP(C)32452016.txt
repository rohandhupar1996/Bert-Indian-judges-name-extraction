                                                  &
                        THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE D.P. CHOUDHURY
             ________________________________________________________
                Date of hearing: 09.05.2016           Date of Judgment: 21.06.2016
             ________________________________________________________
Dr. D.P. Choudhury, J.    Challenge has been made to the inappropriate action of
             the opposite parties in not selecting the petitioner in the competitive
             examination held for the Odisha Judicial Service Examination 2013-
             2014.
             FACTS
             2.           The factual context as depicted is that the petitioner was
             a candidate for the Odisha Judicial Service Examination 2013-2014
             bearing Roll No.3780. In the preliminary written examination he was

                                     2
selected but in the written test his name did not figure in the list called
for viva voce test. While he unveiled the reasons for not getting his call
for viva voce test, it was revealed that in the paper “Law of Property”
he has not secured correct mark and consequently in the aggregate
mark. In order to find out the reason of disqualification, he applied for
Xerox answer scripts pursuant to the procedure adopted by the Odisha
Public Service Commission (hereinafter called ‘OPSC’). It is further
asserted that on verification of the Xerox copy of the answer scripts he
became astonished that he was awarded ‘0’ mark against question
No.12(b)(i) although his answer was correct.
3.     It is stated that as per the Scheme of Examination he was
required to secure not less than 45% of marks in aggregate and
minimum      33%    of   marks in   each  paper    in    the   Main written
examination. From the website of the OPSC the petitioner came to
know that his total mark is 336 purportedly falling short of two marks
from the aggregate marks which evidently for wrong evaluation of his
paper in “Law of Property”. He is deprived of three marks in such
paper for gross negligence, illegality in evaluating his answer script in
the paper “Law of Property”. Under Section-C Question No.12 (b) (i) is
read as follows:-
              “12    (b)  Whether   the  following    illustrations are
              sufficient acknowledgement of liabilities:
              (i) “I am ashamed that the account has stood so
                  long.”
       Petitioner has answered to such question in following manner:

                                        3
              “No.12 (b)
              (i)     I am ashamed that the account has stood so
                       long – It is a valid acknowledgement.”
              It is alleged, inter alia, that the answer of the petitioner to
the said question is apparently available from the Text Book and as
such the petitioner has answered correctly although he was awarded
‘0’ mark instead of three marks in such question. Had the three marks
added to the paper Law of Property, his aggregate would have been
raised by giving him qualifying mark of 45% in aggregate. On the
other hand, he could have been qualified for the viva voce test in the
event of adding such three marks to the paper Law of Property. So, the
petitioner alleged that the faulty and arbitrariness in evaluation of his
paper has deprived him to get justice and compelling him to knock the
door of the Court seeking relief of revaluation of Question No.12 (b) (i)
and consequently the OPSC be given direction as deemed fit and
proper by the Court.
SUBMISSIONS
4.            It is submitted by Mr. Pattnaik, learned counsel for the
petitioner that by the illegal and arbitrary action of the opposite parties
the petitioner has been deprived of in attending the viva voce test as
per rule and consequently he was deprived of his employment in the
event of his selection in the viva voce test. The action of the opposite
parties was not only illegal and arbitrary but also smacks the flow

                                     4
of justice by depriving the petitioner from becoming a Judicial Officer.
He further submitted that there were 69 vacancies as available from
the advertisement made by the OPSC to the post of Civil Judges in
Odisha Judicial Service, 2014 vide Annexure-1 and only 52 number of
candidates were called for interview. Had there been correct evaluation
of the mark in the case of the petitioner, he could have at least got a
call for viva voce test and ultimately he had got fair chance of
successful in the interview and ultimately would have got a berth in
the Odisha Judicial service. He further submitted that Articles 14 and
16 of the Constitution of India of the petitioner has been violated by
the opposite parties for which the Court may intervene and award
justice to the petitioner. He cited the decision of this Court reported in
2016 (I) ILR – CUT-652 (Prajna Lalit Mishra V. O.P.S.C., & others)
where this Court has taken decision by allowing the petitioner in that
case to appear in a special interview and in the event of success, the
opposite parties were directed to give her appointment with full
protection of seniority along with other benefits.
5.            Mr. Mohanty, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
opposite party No.1 contended that as per the model answer sheet the
papers of the petitioner and other examinees were evaluated and in no
case the petitioner has been awarded mark illegally. According to him
the contention of the petitioner for reference to different Text Books to
find out the answer to the Question No.12 (b) (i) cannot be taken into
consideration since the opposite party No.1 is bound to refer to the

                                     5
model answers as similar procedure has been adopted in respect of all
the   candidates.   Moreover,    he    submitted    that   the  facts and
circumstances of the Authority cited by the petitioner is different from
the facts and circumstances of the present case. He further submitted
that even if the petitioner is selected, he cannot claim employment in
the year 2016 when he appeared the Examinations of 2014 and the
appointments of candidates have been already held in the interregnum
and at no cost the petitioner is entitled to get reliefs asked for.
6. The point for consideration:-
(i)    Whether the petitioner has answered correctly in Question
No.12 (b) (i) of paper “Law of Property” and being deprived of the
three marks and consequently in aggregate marks.
DISCUSSIONS
POINT NO.(i) :
7.           It is admitted fact that the petitioner was a candidate
bearing Roll No.3780 for the Odisha Judicial Service Examination
2013-2014. It is admitted fact that he has appeared in the Main
Written Examination as available from the answer at Annexure-5
where he has secured total written marks 336. It is admitted fact that
in the said Examination the candidate has to secure 33% marks in
each paper and in total the candidate has to secure 45% of marks so
as to qualify for attending viva voce test as per the Odisha Superior
Judicial Service and Odisha Judicial Service Rules 2007 (hereinafter
called ‘the Rules 2007). It is also not disputed that during 2013-2014

                                      6
advertisement was made by the opposite party No.1 for filing up 69
vacancies to the post of Civil Judges in Orissa vide Annexure-1 series.
The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the
paper Law of Property vide Annexure-7 series Question No.12 (b)
carries 15 marks. As stated, the said question has got five illustrations
and it has been asked whether those illustrations are sufficient
acknowledgement of liabilities. Learned counsel for the opposite party
No.1 has not filed the Scheme of Examination showing the model
answer. Since the onus lies on the petitioner to show that he has given
the right answer, he got the Text Book written by one Dr. Ashok Kumar
Jain where the illustration of sufficient acknowledgement of liability has
been mentioned at page 113 stating “I am ashamed that the account
has stood so long”. He also produced the Text Book of B.B. Mitra on
the Limitation Act 1963 of the 1994 edition where at page-302 under
Section 18 of the Limitation Act it has been mentioned that “I am
ashamed that the account has stood so long” was held to be a good
acknowledgement. The author has also cited said proposition being
observed in the case of Cornford v Smithard (1859) 5 H & N 13;
Holmes v Mackrell (1858) 3 CB (NS) 789. When the Text Book of
reputed author speaks about the answer followed by another author
Dr. Jain and the Text Book has quoted the same from the Case Laws,
it is undoubtedly that sufficient acknowledgement of liability would be
if the person concerned admitted “I am ashamed that the account has
stood so long”. Learned counsel for the opposite parties could not

                                   7
produce any document including model answers against the Text Book
contents to explain such answer to be incorrect. On going through
Annexures-5 and 6 series it appears that the petitioner has answered
in the same manner and as such he is entitled to get three marks for
such answer but unfortunately was awarded ‘0’ mark against such
answer. When the petitioner has proved that he has answered
correctly Question No.12 (b) (i) in paper “Law of Property” according
to Text Book and the opposite party No.1 has not produced the
Scheme of Examination including model answer but merely submits
that the model answer according to Scheme of Examination is
otherwise to such question, we are constrained to observe that the
petitioner is entitled to three marks in accordance with the correct
answer given by him. Point No.(i) is answered accordingly.
CONCLUSION
8.           Since the petitioner has given the correct answer to
Question No.12 (b) (i) in paper “Law of Property” in the Main Written
Examination and is entitled to three marks against such answer, we
are of the considered view that petitioner is entitled to the re-addition
of marks to the paper concerned and consequently to the re-addition
of the total marks. At the same time, we are conscious that the Court
cannot sit as an examiner but can opine about the injustice meted out
to the petitioner. It is appropriate for the opposite parties to re-
evaluate the answer in Question No.12 (b) (i) of the petitioner and
make fresh tabulation of aggregate of marks. In the event of fresh

                                      8
evaluation and tabulation if the petitioner qualifies, he should be given
consequential benefits.
9.            Hence, we direct the opposite parties in the following
manner:-
(i)    The opposite parties shall re-evaluate the answers of the
petitioner to the Question No.12 (b) (i) in the light of the observation
made above and make fresh tabulation of marks in aggregate. In the
event of his success in the main written examination, opposite parties
shall arrange a special interview for the petitioner.
(ii)   In the event he comes out successful in the interview, he should
be given appropriate place in the final merit list of OJS Examination
2014 and should be given appointment accordingly with full protection
of his seniority amongst successful candidates of the said Examination
2014 as per redrawal of merit list as we are aware that there were 69
vacancies in the said year.
10.           All these exercises should be completed by opposite
parties within a period of two months from today and necessary
compliance be reported on 25.8.2016.
              The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
                                               …………………………….
