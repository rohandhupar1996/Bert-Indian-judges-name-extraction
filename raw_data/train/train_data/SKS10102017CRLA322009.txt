Govt. of Orissa had sanctioned money in 1985 under the Rural
Labour Employment Guarantee Programme (in short ‘RLEGP’)
scheme for execution of rehabilitation and restocking of degraded
forest work in undivided Koraput district. The appellant Kalakar
Mohanty was working as Range Officer, Nabarangpur and he
received Govt. funds in advance from D.F.O., Nabarangpur from

He executed trench digging, gap plantation, forest cleaning
works through other accused persons and paid wages to the
labourers in shape of money, rice and wheat by preparing muster
rolls and vouchers. It is the further prosecution case that the
appellants and others dishonestly misappropriated Govt. money

Vigilance, Nabarangpur presented a written report (Ext.50)
before   the  Superintendent of Police, Vigilance,     Berhampur

4.           The defence plea of the appellants was one of denial.
Four witnesses were examined on behalf of the defence.

                                10
            D.W.1 Bhudan Jani stated about his engagement as a
labourer in the plantation work, drain digging work and jungle
cleaning work in Palapur Jungle.
            D.W.2     Gangadhar     Gouda     stated  about    his
engagement as a labourer for cleaning of drains, forest and
plantation of trees in Jamuguda forest area.
            D.W.3 Arjun Nayak stated about the trench digging,
gap plantation and cleaning works conducted during the year
1985-86 and 1986-87 in Pujariguda, Jamuguda and Palapur
forest.
            D.W.4 Rajkishore Patnaik was the R.I. who stated
about the trench work and fixation of pillars in Jambuguda forest.
5.          The learned trial Court after assessing the evidence
on record came to hold that the Exts. 4, 32, 33, 34 and 35 taken
together established that at the relevant time appellant Kalakar
Mohanty was the Range Officer, appellant Prafulla Chandra Patra
was the Forester and other accused persons including appellant
Lambodar Pujari were the Forest Guards. It was further held that
from the evidence of P.Ws.1, 5 and 16 and the documents, it is
crystal clear that appellant Kalakar Mohanty received money and
food grains from the D.F.O., Nabarangpur to execute restocking
of degraded forest work over 385 hectares at Pujariguda,

                                 11
Jamuguda and Palapur through other accused persons. It was
further held that Exts.3 and 13 taken together established that
the accused persons had executed 10,831 running meters of
trench in the disputed sites but they had shown to have executed
11,792 running meters of trench and therefore, the shortage was
961 running meters of trench works which involves Rs.11,665.97
paisa as per scheduled rate and the appellant Kalakar Mohanty
had submitted expenditure statement under letter Ext.25. It was
further held that the prosecution has failed to produce and prove
the connected vouchers to gain advantage out of the report of
the finger print expert and therefore, the opinion of the finger
print expert Ext.14 is of no help to the prosecution and without
the proof of other vouchers, the Court cannot jump into
irresistible conclusion that the accused persons forged the L.T.Is.
of some labourers for the purpose of misappropriation. It was
further held that the appellants Kalakar Mohanty, Prafulla
Chandra Patra and Lambodar Pujari are liable for the excess
payment of Rs.11,765.97 paisa. It was further held that Exts.3
and 13 disclosed that the accused had shown excess work in the
measurements, vouchers, cash books and expenditure statement
and length of 961 meters of trench was found shortage and that
the appellants in furtherance of their common intention forged

                                  12
the records, registers and documents of their employer by
making    false  and   fictitious  entries with  an  intention  to
misappropriate Government money and property dishonestly and
in that process, they gained wrongfully and forest department of
Government of Orissa sustained substantial loss.
6.           Learned counsels for the appellants while challenging
the impugned judgment and order of conviction contended that
though the case was registered, inter alia, under section 13(2)
read with section 13(1)(c) of the 1988 Act but the investigation
has not been conducted by the designated police officer as
prescribed under section 17 of the said Act but it was conducted
by Inspector of Vigilance and therefore, the investigation is
vitiated in the eye of law. It is further contended that the
prosecution has miserably failed to establish the fact that the
appellants have abused their official positions with dishonest
intention causing pecuniary benefits either to them or to any
other persons. It is further contended that the joint verification
report as per Ext.13 is suspicious in nature and the prosecution
has not shown any reason for non-examination of Amins through
whom the trench works were measured. It is further contended
that the presence of P.W.3, the Deputy Conservator of Forest
during the period of joint verification on three dates i.e.

                                 13
21.04.1990, 04.06.1990 and 05.06.1990 is very much doubtful.
It is further contended that the joint verification was made in
respect of trench work after lapse of four (4) rainy seasons and
therefore, at that stage, it would be too difficult to find out the
exact nature of works done. It is further contended that the
prosecution has failed to establish the involvement of the
appellants in payment of wages to fake labourers. It is further
contended that the mere maintenance of Cash Book by appellant
Kalakar Mohanty relying upon the muster rolls of the labourers
and measurement book is not sufficient to hold him guilty of
misappropriation of cash with the other co-accused persons in
falsifying the cash book with malafide intention to defraud the
Govt. and thereby gaining wrongfully. It is further contended that
the prosecution has miserably failed to establish in which way the
appellants   have  forged    the  documents,    using   the  forged
documents as genuine and willfully and with intent to defraud,
destroyed, altered or mutilated or falsified any accounts and
therefore, the charges under sections 467, 471 and 477-A of the
Indian Penal Code have not established beyond reasonable
doubt. Learned counsels placed reliance in the cases of S.
Harnam Singh -Vrs.- The State (Delhi Admn.) reported in
A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 2140, S.K. Mansur Alli -Vrs.- State of

                                14
Orissa reported in 2008 (Supp-II) Orissa Law Reviews 963
and Birabar Sethi -Vrs.- State of Orissa reported in (2012)
53 Orissa Criminal Reports 319.
             Mr. Sanjay Kumar Das, learned Standing Counsel
appearing for the Vigilance Department on the other hand
contended that the defect or irregularity in investigation would
not vitiate the trial unless there is miscarriage of justice. It is
further contended that the learned trial Court has minutely
assessed the evidence on record and while acquitting the two co-
accused persons came to the conclusion regarding proving of the
prosecution case against the three appellants. The learned
counsel placed reliance on the evidence of P.W.3, P.W.16 and the
Investigating Officer (P.W.21) and contended that such evidence
is very clinching against the appellants and the joint verification
report also established the guilt of the appellants. It is further
contended that the opinion of the finger print expert also proves
that details of labourers shown to have been engaged in the
trench works, fencing, plantation etc. are not fully correct and
payment has been shown against some fake persons. Learned
counsel placed reliance in the cases of State of Madhya
Pradesh -Vrs.- Shri Rama Singh reported in 2000 (1)

                                 15
Crimes 245 and Ashok Tshering Bhutia -Vrs.- State of
Sikkim reported in A.I.R. 2011 S.C. 1363.
7.           Adverting to the first contention raised by the learned
counsels for the appellants regarding power of the Inspector of
Vigilance to investigate the case, Chapter-IV of 1988 Act deals
with investigation into the cases under the said Act. Section 17 of
the Act states about the persons authorised to investigate any
offence punishable under the Act. Section 17 (c) of the Act, inter
alia, states that no police officer below the rank of a Deputy
Superintendent of Police or a police officer of equivalent rank
shall investigate any offence punishable under the Act without
the order of a Magistrate of the first class. Therefore, a Deputy
Superintendent of Police or a police officer of equivalent rank can
investigate any offence punishable under the 1988 Act. Any other
police officer who is below the rank of D.S.P. can also investigate
such offence, inter alia, under the order of a Magistrate of the
first class. The proviso to section 17 of the Act states that the
order of a Magistrate of the first class is not required for
investigation of such offence in the case of a police officer not
below the rank of an Inspector of Police, if he is authorised by
the State Government in that behalf by general or special order.
The Parliament in its wisdom has conferred power on the State

                                 16
Government, as per the first proviso to section 17 of the Act, to
empower police officers not below the rank of Inspector of Police,
for investigation of the offence under the Act. Thus not only the
Deputy Superintendent of Police or a police officer of equivalent
rank can investigate the offence but also other police officer
below the rank of D.S.P. can investigate the offence under the
order of a Magistrate of the first class and even police officer not
below the rank of an Inspector of Police can also investigate the
offence being authorised by the State Government in that behalf
by general or special order even without the order of a
Magistrate of the first class.
            In the present case, the investigation was first
conducted by one S.C. Biswal, Inspector of Vigilance and then by
P.W.21 Madan Khatua, Inspector of Vigilance, Rayagada who
took charge of investigation on 03.04.1990 and after completion
of investigation submitted charge sheet.
            The learned counsels for the appellants have not
placed   any    materials   before   this Court  with   regard    to
incompetency of the Investigating Officers to investigate the
case. Even P.W.21 has not been asked a single question in that
line in the cross examination relating to his incompetency to

                                17
investigate the case. No such point was taken by the defence
before the learned trial Court.

           Sub:- Authority of Inspectors of Vigilance
            Department to investigate offences under

            49 of 1988)
                   The undersigned is directed to say that it
            has come to the notice of Government that
            doubts have arisen in the minds of some officers
            whether the authority vested in Vigilance
            Inspectors in the orders of the Government of
            Orissa in the Home Department No.2618/HC
            dated 29th July, 1970 and No.46337/HC dated
            the 13th October, 1977 to investigate the cases
            under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (2
            of 1947) is still in force under the new
            Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (49 of 1988)
                   After careful examination of all aspects of
            the matter, Government have been pleased to
            clarify that by virtue of the provision of Sections
            6 and 24 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of
            1897) read with section 30 of the Act, 49 of
            1988, the aforesaid orders are still in force even
            after the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is
            repealed, since the same are not inconsistent
            with the provisions of Act 49 of 1988.

                     PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT
            It is in the lawful exercise of the powers conferred
under the first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 5-A of the
1947 Act that the State Government has issued the aforesaid two
orders dated 29.07.1970 and 13.10.1977 empowering the
Inspector of Police attached to the Vigilance Department to
investigate the cases under the 1947 Act which has also been

                                  20
clarified to be applicable for investigation under the 1988 Act by
letter dated 17.04.93.
             In case of Ashok Tshering Bhutia -Vrs.- State of
Sikkim reported in A.I.R. 2011 S.C. 1363, it is held as
follows:-
             “8. The issues raised hereinabove are no more
             res integra. The matter of investigation by an
             officer   not   authorised    by  law   has   been
             considered by this Court time and again and it
             has consistently been held that a defect or
             irregularity in investigation however serious, has
             no    direct  bearing   on   the   competence    or
             procedure relating to cognizance or trial and,
             therefore, where the cognizance of the case has
             in fact been taken and the case has proceeded
             to termination, the invalidity of the precedent
             investigation does not vitiate the result, unless a
             miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby.
             The defect or irregularity in investigation has no
             bearing on the competence of the Court or
             procedure relating to cognizance or trial. (Vide
             H.N. Rishbud and Anr. -Vrs.- State of Delhi:
             AIR 1955 SC 196, Munnalal -Vrs.- State of
             U.P.: AIR 1964 SC 28, Khandu Sonu Dhobi
             and Anr. -Vrs.- The State of Maharashtra:

            Virender Kumar Tripathi: (2009) 15 SCC
            533.”
            In case of Din Dayal Sharma -Vrs.- The State of
U.P. reported in A.I.R. 1959 S.C. 831, it is held that generally
a conviction is not vitiated because there has not been strict
compliance with the provisions of the Act in the matter of
investigation by a police officer.
            In case of State of Madhya Pradesh -Vrs.- Shri
Rama Singh reported in 2000 (1) Crimes 245, it is held that
procedural delays and technicalities of law should not be
permitted to defeat the object sought to be achieved by the
Prevention of Corruption Act. The overall public interest and the
social object is required to be kept in mind interpreting various
provisions of the Act and decided cases under it.
            In view of the aforesaid discussions, the submission
made by the learned counsels for the appellants that since the
investigation has been conducted by the Inspector of Vigilance,
therefore, the investigation is vitiated in the eye of law cannot be
accepted. I am of the humble view that the investigation
conducted in this case by the two Inspectors of Vigilance is with

                                 22
proper authority and jurisdiction and therefore, the challenge to
the competency of the investigating officers is without any merit.
8.           Much comments have been made by the learned
counsels for the appellants on the spot inspection report Ext.3
and joint verification report Ext.13.
             It is the prosecution case that P.W.3 Bairagi Ch.
Prusty, the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Vigilance conducted
the spot verification as per the direction of D.G., Vigilance on
21.04.1990 and 05.06.1990 as there was complain about large
scale bungling of Govt. money by the Forest Department during
the rehabilitation of degraded forest work in the Nabarangpur
Forest Division in the year 1986-87. P.W.3 has stated that there
were three components of such work i.e., regeneration cleaning,
graft planting and trench fencing and 385 hectors of such work
were spreaded over three villages namely Pujariguda, Jamuguda
and Palapur. He has further stated that in respect of the first two
components i.e. regeneration cleaning and graft planting, it was
difficult to assess the quantum of work done and possibility of
the extent of misappropriation. However, P.W.3 has stated that
in respect of the third component i.e. trench fencing, out of
11792 meters length of trench to have been charged in the work
done vouchers, only 10,831 meters trench could be measured

                                23
and the balance 961 meters of trench have not been done and
the    proportionate   cost  of  which   was   calculated    to   be
Rs.11,765.97 paisa which might have been misappropriated.
              P.W.3 has admitted in the cross examination that his
verification was done three and half years after execution of the
work. He has further admitted that the trenches were partially
filled up due to soil erosion during rainy season. He has stated
that he completed the verification in two days time and the
verification was conducted in the presence of P.W.18, P.W.21
and other officers. He proved the spot inspection report Ext.3.
              P.W.18  who   was   the  Range    Officer,  Vigilance,
Berhampur and a member of joint verification party has stated
that the joint verification was done on 06.06.1990 and other
dates which contradict the evidence of P.W.3. He has proved the
joint   verification report  Ext.13   which  indicates   that   such
verification was conducted on three dates i.e. 21.04.1990,
04.06.1990 and 05.06.1990 and the report was prepared on
06.06.1990 in which the officers who were present at the time of
physical verification have put their signatures. P.W.18 has
categorically stated that for the spot verification, P.W.3 had
visited the spot only one day with them. The Investigating Officer
(P.W.21) has also stated that the joint verification i.e. physical

                                 24
measurement      of  trench    work  was   taken  on  21.04.1990,
04.06.1990 and 05.06.1990 in three different village site forests.
If the evidence of P.Ws.18 and 21 are taken into account then it
is clear that P.W.3 was not present on all the three dates of joint
verification. The statement made by P.W.18 even falsifies the
evidence of P.W.3 that he conducted spot verification on two
dates i.e. on 21.04.1990 and 05.06.1990. Ext.3 does not contain
the signatures of the officers in whose presence the verification
was conducted. Ext.13 does not indicate that P.W.3 was present
at the time of physical verification on any day. Ext.13 indicates
the presence of P.W.22, the Sub Inspector of Vigilance on the
dates of physical verification but P.W.22 has stated that he was
present only on 06.06.1990. Ext.13 further reveals the presence
of P.W.6 on the dates of physical verification but P.W.6 who was
the chainman in the office of D.F.O., Nabarangpur has stated
that he accompanied the vigilance staff only on 04.06.1990 and
measurement of trench work at Palpur forest was taken by him.
His evidence is totally silent regarding the measurement of works
in other areas. P.W.18 and P.W.22 stated about the joint
verification on 06.06.1990 whereas the evidence of P.W.3 and
P.W.21 is silent about any joint verification on that day.
Therefore, the evidence of the official witnesses in whose

                                 25
presence joint verification is stated to have been made are
discrepant and it does not tally with the joint verification report
Ext.13. All these pre-supposes that even though the officers
whose names find place in Ext.13 were not present on all the
three dates of physical verification but they have put their
signatures subsequent to measurement and the dates placed
under their signatures are ante-dated. The presence of the Amin
at the time of measurement has been stated by P.Ws.3, 18 and
21. Two Amins who as per Ext.13 were stated to be present at
the time of joint verification and put their signatures on the
verification report were not chosen to be examined for the best
reasons known to the prosecution. P.W.21 has specifically stated
that Ext.40, the trace map was prepared by the Amins during
joint verification. Though the said trace map was exhibited by the
prosecution as Ext.40 but the Amins, who had prepared the same
have not been examined. In view of the aforesaid infirmities, the
spot inspection report (Ext.3) prepared by P.W.3 and joint
verification report Ext.13 loses its sanctity.
9.           The learned trial Court has failed to appreciate that
though the trench works in respect of three village sites forests
were executed in the year 1986-87 but the trenches were
measured after passing of four consecutive rainy seasons and

                                 26
therefore, the possibility of most part of the trenches being filled
up due to soil erosion during those rainy seasons cannot be ruled
out and it would be too difficult to ascertain the exact nature of
work done by measurement at that stage. Merely because P.W.3
has stated that even after lapse of three and half years, the
works done in respect of the trench can be ascertained is not
sufficient to believe prosecution case that the trenches have been
properly measured. In case of Birabar Sethi -Vrs.- State of
Orissa reported in (2012) 53 Orissa Criminal Reports 319,
it is held that judicial notice can very well be taken of the fact
that the concrete road used by the villagers constructed over
four years back, cannot have the same measurement and quality
as it had on the date, when it constructed.
10.          The prosecution evidence reveals that the Forest
Guard enters the names of the labourers in muster roll and at the
time of payment to the labourers, their L.T.Is. or signatures as
the case may be are taken against their names in the muster
roll. The Forester disburses the wages of the labourers in
presence of the Forest Guard and makes endorsement to the
effect. The Cash Book is maintained by the Range Officer. The
prosecution has failed to bring home any materials on record as
to who are the fake labourers whose names were indicated in the

                                27
muster rolls and payment of wages have been made in respect of
such labourers. As per the Orissa Forest Code, measurement
book is prepared by the Forester and after the Cash Book is
placed before the D.F.O., the vouchers can be withheld,
disallowed or adjusted, if the D.F.O. finds any inaccuracy in the
accounts and suspects fraud. The D.F.O. can also call for
explanation from the officer concerned who had disbursed the
amount as per the voucher. In the present case, neither the
vouchers were withheld nor disallowed which shows that there
was no suspicion of fraud or dictation of inaccuracy in the
vouchers for which the D.F.O. has allowed the vouchers.
            The learned trial Court has observed in its judgment
that the prosecution has failed to produce and prove the
connected vouchers to gain advantage out of the report of the
finger print expert (P.W.15). It is further held that though the
voucher no.48 of 9/87 has been marked as Ext.29 and it was
sent to P.W.15 but P.W.15 has failed to give any definite opinion
on the said document due to certain infirmities. It was further
held that the opinion of the finger print expert vide Ext.14 is of
no help to the prosecution and the prosecution has not proved
any vouchers save and except Exts.29, 30 and 31 and in absence
of proof of other vouchers, Ext.14 is inconsequential for the

                                28
prosecution. It is further held that without proof of other
vouchers, the Court cannot jump to the irresistible conclusion
that the accused persons forged the L.T.Is. of some labourers for
the purpose of misappropriation. When the labourers like P.Ws.7
to 14 have categorically admitted that they have received their
wages, the question of false L.T.Is. does not arise at all.
            In case of S. Harnam Singh -Vrs.- The State
(Delhi Admn.) reported in A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 2140, it is held
that in order to bring home an offence under section 477-A of the
Indian Penal Code, the prosecution has to establish (1) that at
the relevant time, the accused was a clerk, officer or servant;
and (2) that acting in that capacity he destroyed, altered,
mutilated or falsified any book, paper, writing, valuable security
or account which belonged to or is in the possession of his
employer or has been received by him for and on behalf of his
employer etc. (3) that he did so willfully and with intent to
defraud.
            In case of S.K. Mansur Alli -Vrs.- State of Orissa
reported in 2008 (Supp-II) Orissa Law Reviews 963, it is
held that a plane reading of sections 463 and 464 of the Indian
Penal Code goes to show that the two essential elements of
forgery contemplated under section 463 of the I.P.C. are: (i) the

                                29
making of a false document or part of it, and (ii) such making
should be with such intention as is specified in the section. The
accused must have made a false document or a part of such
document, in the absence of which he cannot be held guilty
under this section. When it is not proved that the accused affixed
the false signature or thumb impression, he cannot be held guilty
under section 464 of the IPC for which what is essential is that
the accused must make document with the intention of making it
to be believed that it was signed by or by the authority of
someone else, while he knows that it was not so made or
authorised by that person.
             In view of the finding of the learned trial Court that
there is lack of evidence to come to a conclusion regarding
forgery of L.T.Is. of the labourers by the appellants for the
purpose of misappropriation, the conviction of the appellants
under sections 467, 471, 477A/34 of the Indian Penal Code is
totally misconceived inasmuch as all these three offences require
the element of forgery as defined under section 463 of the Indian
Penal Code which is conspicuously absent in the case.
11.          The prosecution has failed to establish that the
appellants have abused their official position with dishonest
intention causing pecuniary benefit to themselves or to any

                                     30
persons. When the offence of forgery is not made out and there
is lack of clinching evidence that the appellants dishonestly or
fraudulently misappropriated any property entrusted to them or
otherwise converted the same for their own use, it cannot be
said that they have conducted any criminal misconduct and
therefore, the offence punishable under section 5(2) read with
section 5(1)(c) of the 1947 Act cannot be presumed to have
been established against them.
12.              In view of the foregoing discussion, when the
prosecution case suffers from serious infirmities, the guilt of the
appellants have not been established beyond reasonable doubt
and the impugned judgment suffers from perversity, I am
constrained to give benefit of doubt to the appellants.
                 In the result, the appeals are allowed. The impugned
judgment and order of conviction and the sentence passed
thereunder is set aside and the appellants are acquitted of all the
charges. The appellants are on bail by virtue of the orders of this
Court. They are discharged from liability of their bail bonds. The
personal bonds and the surety bonds stand cancelled.
