                         IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
           (High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh)
                                      WP(C) No.2614 of 2012
                                     Sri Krishna Kanta Haldar
                                                                   ............ Petitioner
                                             - Versus –
                                      The State of Assam and others
                                                                    ........ Respondents
                                             BEFORE
                        HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.M. BUJOR BARUA
                       For the petitioner:       Mr. M.J. Barua, Adv
                       For the respondents:      Mr. S.B. Sarma, SC Fishery
                                                 Mr. G. Petu, State Counsel
                       Date of Hearing :        24.07.2017.
                       Date of Judgment:       24.07.2017.
                          JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
              Heard Mr. M.J. Barua, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. S.B
      Sarma, learned Standing Counsel for the respondent AFDC and also Mr.
      G.Pegu, learned State Counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 1, 4 and 5.
      2.      The petitioner was settled with 43/44 Pavakata Sondoba Fishery for a
      period of five years from 2002-2007. It is the case of the petitioner that upon
      operating the said fishery, the petitioner could find that almost 50% of the
      fishery had merged with the river Brahmaputra and as such, the petitioner
      could not conduct any fishing operation in respect of 50% of the fishery.

      3.      Being aggrieved, the petitioner had earlier preferred two writ petitions
      before this Court being WP(C) No.1734/2007 and WP(C) No.2148/2007, which
      were disposed of by the common judgment and order dated 08.06.2007,
      wherein the respondent corporation was directed to consider and dispose of
      the representation filed by the petitioner in terms of the rules and guidelines.
      It was specifically provided that the said order should not be construed to be
      an order to grant remission/extension to the petitioner and that it was merely
      an order for consideration.
      4.      Be that as it may, by the order dated 19.07.2017 of the Managing
      Director of the respondent corporation an extension for a period of one year
      was granted to the petitioner for the year 2007-2008 up to 31.03.2008.
      Accordingly, the petitioner operated the fishery in question for the extended
      period of one year.
      5.      After operating the fishery for the extended period of one year, the
      petitioner submitted a further application dated 19.12.2008 for grant of
      remission, inasmuch as, the petitioner could not operate the whole of the
      fishery even during the extended period. The petitioner preferred another writ
      petition before this Court being WP(C) No.786/2008, which was disposed of
      by the order dated 07.03.2008 by providing that the question as to whether
      the petitioner had paid any excess revenue to the respondent authorities in
      respect of the fishery in question, shall be settled by the corporation while
      taking a decision as per reference made by the Managing Director to the
      Board    on 25.07.2007. Accordingly, the petitioner submitted              another
      representation dated 24.03.2008 before the respondent authorities justifying
      that the petitioner is entitled to certain remission. The petitioner filed another
      writ petition before this Court being WP(C) No.1240/2008, which was
      disposed of by the order dated 04.08.2009. In the order dated 04.08.2009,
      this Court had directed the respondent authorities to take an appropriate
      decision with respect of the reduction in revenue as prayed for by the writ
      petitioner.
      6.      In the aforesaid circumstance, this writ petition has been again
      preferred by the writ petitioner with a prayer that the prayer of the petitioner
      for remission of revenue in terms of an earlier letter dated 25.07.2007 and
      the earlier directions of this Court be duly considered and appropriate order
WP(C) No.2614 of 2012                                                             Page 2 of 4

      for remission be passed. In the writ petition, a letter dated 10.04.2012 of the
      Managing Director of the respondent corporation had also been assailed,
      whereby the petitioner was directed to pay certain arrear revenue amounting
      to `2,27,356/-.
      7.      In paragraph-34 of the writ petition, the petitioner takes a stand that
      although there had been earlier orders of this Court to consider the grant of
      remission in favour of the petitioner, but without giving any such
      consideration, the respondent authorities have issued a letter dated
      10.04.2012 requiring the petitioner to pay an arrear revenue amounting to
      `2,27,356/-.
      8.      The respondent corporation on the other hand has filed an affidavit in
      opposition dated 05.06.2017, wherein a letter dated 01.08.2008 of the
      Managing Director addressed to the petitioner had been annexed. As per the
      said letter, an amount of `1,88,600/- was deducted from the total yearly
      revenue of `4,95,000/- for the year 2007-08 and `3,06,400/- was re-assessed
      as the yearly revenue for the year 2007-08. In the view of the respondent
      authorities, the aforesaid provisions of deducting the amount of `1,88,600/-
      and re-assessing the revenue for the year 2007-08 at `3,06,400/- was the
      due consideration of the respondent authorities granting appropriate
      remission to the petitioner as prayed for.
      9.      But, it is also noticed that the said letter of 01.08.2008 was prior to
      the order of this Court dated 04.08.2009. In such view of the matter, the
      respondent corporation had issued another order dated 12.10.2009, which
      was passed pursuant to the order of this Court dated 04.08.2009 in WP(C)
      No.1240/2008. In the said order, it had been recorded that as per the earlier
      letter dated 01.08.2008, the yearly revenue for the year 2007-08 had already
      been fixed by deducting an amount of `1,88,600/-. Therefore, in view of the
      respondent authorities, the said decision itself was a compliance of the
      direction of this Court and therefore, there was no requirement of any further
      reconsideration. According to the respondent authorities, the aforesaid fact of
      grant of remission to the petitioner was not placed before this Court and
      therefore, the earlier order of 04.08.2009 was passed.
WP(C) No.2614 of 2012                                                          Page 3 of 4

      10.     In such view of the matter, this Court does not find any reason to
      accede to the prayer of the petitioner that further consideration be given as
      regards its prayer for remission. Also in view of the aforesaid finding of this
      Court that the remission to the petitioner had already been given, therefore
      the grievance of the petitioner against the order to pay some arrear revenue
      to the extent of `2,27,356/-, is also found to be unacceptable.
      11.     However, the learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that
      although the petitioner had operated the fishery in question in a truncated
      manner for five years from 2002-2007 and for another extended year for the
      year 2007-08, but the remission as contained in the letter dated 01.08.2008
      pertains only for the extended year i.e. for the year 2007-08 and it does not
      take into consideration the remission that the petitioner may be entitled for
      the earlier period of its truncated operation from 2004-06.
      12.     In such view of the matter, without interfering with the letter dated
      10.04.2012 and also without expressing any view on the remission that has
      been granted to the petitioner by the letter dated 01.08.2008, the respondent
      authorities shall give a further consideration to the prayer of the petitioner for
      grant of remission, if entitled, for the earlier period of 2004-2006.
      13.     Upon giving a due consideration in the aforesaid manner, the
      respondent authorities shall take a final decision on the entitlement of the
      petitioner. The aforesaid exercise be carried out by the respondent authorities
      within three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this
      judgment and order.
              In terms of the above, the writ petition stands disposed of.
                                                                             JUDGE
