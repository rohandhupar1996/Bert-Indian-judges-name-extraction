08.11.2013 itself said respondent No. 3 informed the petitioner that he is not
eligible for the LL.B Final Examination 2012 as his last chance had already been
expired in the year 2011, as per LL.B regulation of said University. According to
the petitioner as per the guidelines of Gauhati University and its notification dated
13.09.2002, a candidate of 3 years LL.B course has to complete his degree within
6 (six) years from the date of his first due LL.B examination and since the
petitioner took his examination 2005-06, his first due LL.B examination was on
2006 that was held only on March 2007 and as such petitioner’s 6 9six) year shall
complete only in the year 2013. Hence, this application for necessary direction to
the authorities of Gauhati University.
        In this petition, the Court on 23.11.2012 while issuing notice to the
respondents, in the interim directed the authorities of the Gauhati University to
accept the Examination Form of LL.B Final Examination, 2012 of the petitioner.
        The respondents Gauhati University submitted that since the petitioner
appeared in the 3 years LL.B Intermediate Examination 2006 that was held in
January, 2007 therefore petitioner’s 1st LL.B preliminary examination was due in
2005. Further, in December 2008, December 2009, December 2010, December
2011, LL.B Final Examination of 3 years course were conducted by the Gauhati
WP(C) No. 5548/2012                                                    Page 2 of 3

University, in which the petitioner appeared and he availed all the four chances
for his appearance in the LL.B Final Examination.
        In its affidavit, the Gauhati University did not state as to when LL.B
Preliminary and Intermediate examinations were held in the years 2005, 2006,
2007 and 2008.
         However, since the petitioner has already filled up the Form for LL.B Final
Examination 2012 pursuant to order dated 23.11.2012 that was passed earlier by
this court in this proceeding and also appeared in said LL.B Final Examination,
2012 that was held in January, 2013; without going into the legality and validity
of the order dated 08.11.2012 of the respondent Gauhati University, challenged
in this proceeding, the Court is of the opinion that there is no reason to hold back
the petitioner’s result in the said examination.
        Accordingly, the concerned authority of the respondent Gauhati University
is directed to publish the result of the petitioner in his LLB Final Examination,
2012 that was held in January, 2013 within a period of 3 weeks from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order, to be submitted by the petitioner before the
respondent No. 3, the Controller of Examinations, Gauhati University.
        With the aforesaid observation and direction this writ petition stands
disposed of.
                                                                  JUDGE
