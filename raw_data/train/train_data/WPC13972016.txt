Ms. DD Barman, the      learned State counsel for the respondent Nos. 2 and 3.
Respondent No.4 is represented by the learned counsel Mr. A Todi.
2.                The case of the writ petitioner in brief is that she was appointed
as typist on compassionate ground vide office order dated 29.11.1988
(Annexure-2). The said appointment was subject to the             condition that she
acquires the minimum typing speed for the post, the minimum educational
qualification within 2 years. It was also provided that continuation in service
would be considered subject to fulfilment of such conditions.
        WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                    Page 2 of 9

3.                 Thereafter, the petitioner upon qualifying the typing speed
required for the post was permitted to continue in service till 30.11.1990 vide
office order dated 21.9.1990 (Annexure-3). It was also provided that the
minimum educational qualification in terms of her initial appointment order
should be acquired on or before 30.11.1990 failing which, she would be
discharged from service.
4.                 Thereafter, vide office order dated 17.7.1993(Annexure-5), the
petitioner was allowed to continue in service as typist subject to attaining
requisite educational qualification to the post of typist. It was also indicated that
the requisite educational qualification was required for promotion to the next
higher post for fixation of inter-se seniority in the cadre.
5.                 Consequently, upon acquiring requisite qualification i.e. HSSLC
pass certificate, the petitioner was regularised in service w.e.f. 2.7.1993 vide
office order dated 3.11.1995 (Annexure-6). It was further provided that the
seniority of the petitioner would be fixed at a later date as per the relevant rules.
Consequently, the draft finalization gradation list of senior Grade Typist as on
May, 2013 was published by the respondent authorities wherein the name of the
petitioner appeared at Sl No. 69 while the respondent No. 4 appeared at Sl No.
72.
        WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                  Page 3 of 9

6.        The next promotional post from the post of Senior Grade Typist is to the
post of Junior Administrative Assistant (JAA for short). In terms of the Assam
Secretariat Subordinate Service Rules, 1963, the educational qualification
required for promotion is HSLC pass amongst others. Subsequently, the
educational qualification for the post of JAA was enhanced as HSSLC pass vide
the Assam Secretariat Subordinate Service (Amendment) Rules, 1999 which
came into force w.e.f 20.3.1999. The educational qualification was further raised
as Graduate for promotion to the post of JAA vide the Assam Secretariat
Subordinate Service (Amendment) Rules,            2012 which was       notified on
19.10.2012. However, the Assam Secretariat Subordinate Service (Amendment)
Rules, 2012 provides a provision that the requirement of being a graduate would
not applicable to the existing Senior Grade Typist who have rendered their
service as typist since 1987 and 1992.
7.         The State respondents vide office order dated 17.8.2015 (Annexure-11)
promoted as many as 39 Senior Grade Typist/ Senior Grade Computer Operator
of the Secretariat to officiate as JAA under the Rule 8(2) of the Assam Secretariat
Subordinate Service Rules, 1963. Although the juniors to the writ petitioner
including the respondent No.4 were promoted by the said office order, the
petitioner was not considered for the promotion. However, since a number of
Senior Grade Computer Operators were promoted to the post of JAA having the
qualification of HSSLC, the petitioner approached the respondent authorities with
certain queries by filing an application through RTI. In reply to the RTI
        WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                  Page 4 of 9

application, the respondent authorities furnished the requisite reply whereby it
was indicated that the qualification of the Senior Grade Computer Operators is
HSSLC. The petitioner therefore being aggrieved has approached this Court by
filing the instant writ petition.
8.       Appearing for the writ petitioner, Mr. C Baruah submits that the petitioner
was initially appointed as Typist on 29.11.1988 however with certain conditions.
The petitioner was allowed to continue as such till she fulfilled the conditions
imposed for her appointment and she was regularized in service w.e.f 2.7.1993
vide office order dated 3.11.1995. He submits that the petitioner is considering
her position in the gradation list and qualification is eligible to be considered for
promotion to the post of JAA. Although the amended rules of 2012 prescribes the
educational qualification as a Graduate, for being considered for promotion to
JAA, same also contains a provision that the educational qualification of a
Graduate would not be applicable to the existing Senior Grade Typist who have
rendered service as Typist since 1987-1992. The petitioner having rendered her
service since the date of her appointment on 29.11.1988 is eligible to be
considered for promotion to the post of JAA. Mr. C Baruah submits that since the
eligible candidates including those who were junior to the petitioner were
considered for promotion by the respondent authorities and eventually promoted
on 17.8.2015, the petitioner has every right to be considered for similar
promotion from that date. The action of the State respondents for having not
considered the petitioner despite being eligible to be considered is most illegal
         WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                   Page 5 of 9

and arbitrary and therefore he submits that the respondents be accordingly
directed to consider the promotion of the petitioner to the post of JAA.
9.                Appearing for the State respondents, Ms. DD Barman submits
that the petitioner was initially appointed on compassionate basis and with the
condition that she acquires the minimum typing speed and educational
qualification within a period of 2 years from the date of the appointment
although the petitioner acquired the required typing speed, she however failed to
obtain educational qualification of HSSLC within the prescribed period of 2 years.
The respondent authorities nevertheless allowed the petitioner to continue in her
post and eventually the petitioner could only acquire qualification only on
2.7.1993. Consequently, the petitioner could only be regularized w.e.f. 2.7.1993.
Ms. DD Barman submits that although the requisite educational qualification was
HSSLC pass in terms of the amendment of the service rules -1999 but however
by virtue of the amendment effected in 2012, the required educational
qualification was enhanced to degree from a recognized university. She submits
that although the provisio to the amended rule of 2012 excludes the existing
Senior Grade Typist who have rendered their service since 1987-1992, petitioner
having only being regularized w.e.f. 2.7.1993 is not eligible to be considered for
promotion to the post of JAA. Accordingly, the respondent authorities permitted
only those eligible candidates in terms of the rule-2012 vide office order dated
17.8.2015. She thus submits that unless the petitioner obtains the educational
qualification of degree as prescribed by the Rules of 2012, the        case of the
        WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                 Page 6 of 9

petitioner cannot be considered for promotion to the post of JAA. She thus
submits that the petitioner cannot have any legitimate grievance under the
circumstances and therefore the writ petition should be dismissed.
10.                Appearing for the respondent Nos.3 and 4, Mr. A Todi, the
learned counsel submits that respondent No. 4 has requisite qualification of a
degree and therefore he was rightly considered by the respondent authorities for
promotion to the post of JAA.
11.                I have considered the submissions rendered by the learned
counsel for the rival parties and I have also perused the materials available on
record. It may be noticed that although the condition imposed for the
appointment of the petitioner was to obtain the typing speed required for the
post of Typist and also the educational qualification required for the post within a
prescribed time, the petitioner was allowed to continue in service even after the
expiry of the time prescribed. It may be noticed that the appointment was made
on 29.11.1988 and the petitioner acquired the qualification of HSSLC on
2.7.1993. It may be further noticed that in terms of the office order dated
17.7.1993 when the petitioner was allowed to continued, pending her
regularisation to the post, it was indicated in the office order that the educational
qualification for the post of typist would be required for promotion to the next
higher post and fixation of inter-se seniority in the cadre. The petitioner having
acquired the qualification of HSSLC on 2.7.1993 was regularized w.e.f. that date
        WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                   Page 7 of 9

vide office order dated 3.11.1995. Although the qualification of HSSLC holds the
field prior to the framing of the amended Rules of 2012, the minimum
qualification of a degree or graduate from a recognized university came to be
prescribed by the amended Rules, 2012. However, as may be noticed, the 2012
amended Rules provide that the educational qualification of degree would not be
applicable to those existing Senior Grade Typist who have rendered their service
as typist since 1987-1992. As noticed earlier, the petitioner joined the post of
Typist on 29.11.1988 and she has been rendering her service against the
appointed post since then. Going by the provisio laid down in the amended Rules
of 2012, the same in my considered opinion would surely cover the case of the
writ petitioner since the petitioner as stated earlier, has been holding the post
since the year 1988. Moreover, the amended Rules of 2012 did not anywhere
indicate that such benefit would be extended only to the regularized employees.
The State respondents no doubt have the power to make certain restriction and
even fixed a cut off date for certain categories of employees, but nevertheless
the same has to be based on some valid principles which is not irregular,
unreasonable or discriminatory. The provisio provided in the amended Rule 2012
clearly enables to those appointed typist working as such since 1987-1992 to be
eligible for being promoted to the post of JAA without having the qualification of
a degree. Therefore, the contention of the State respondents that the petitioner
having been regularized only on 2.7.1993 cannot be eligible to be considered for
her promotion as per the amended Rules, 2012 cannot be accepted. In that view
of the matter, I find merit in the instant writ petition and having opined thus, the
         WP (C) No. 1397 of 2016                                  Page 8 of 9

State respondents are directed to consider the case of the writ petitioner for
promotion to the post of JAA w.e.f. 17.8.2015 i.e. the date on which persons
junior to the writ petitioner as per the gradation list were promoted to the JAA
post. The respondent authorities i.e. respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 shall carry out
the entire exercise as early as possible and not beyond the outer limit of 3
months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
12.       With the above observations and directions, this writ petition stands
disposed of. No cost.
