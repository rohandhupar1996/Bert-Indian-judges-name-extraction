    Khataniar appearing for State respondent Nos. 1 to 6.
    2)       Though notices were issued upon the respondent Nos. 7 to 9, they did not
    appear and hence the matter proceeded ex parte against them.
    3)       The matter relates to the order dated 28.11.2008 passed by Special and
    Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri cancelling the allotment letter No. 2463/
    1200 dated 23.04.1992 with regard to the land involved in the case and rejecting

    148220 under Book No. 2463 dated 23.04.1992 to the petitioner. The petitioner
    submitted that he filed his objection on 20.11.2008 but the same was not
    considered by the Deputy Commissioner concerned while issuing the impugned
    order dated 28.11.2008. The petitioner also submitted that he earlier approached
    the Executive Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate, Dhubri on 20.08.2008 that
    some persons have taken over his said allotted land and that there is an
    apprehension of peace over the same and accordingly requested the Magistrate to
    initiate a proceeding under Section 144 Cr.P.C. with regard to the said allotted land.
    5)       The Court, in this proceeding, while issuing notice to the respondents on
    04.02.2009 in the interim, suspended the impugned cancellation order dated
    28.11.2008 which is still in force. The Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri for official
    respondents filed detail affidavit in the matter.
    6)       It is seen that as per the Government land allotment policy of Ceiling

Kathas - 8 Lechas under Dag No. 382 at village Sonakhuli, Part-I under Mouza –
Mahamayahat of Agomoni Revenue Circle of Dhubri District in the name of the
petitioner Aminur Rahman Sheikh, son of Yakub Ali of Dighaltary with the specific
condition that he should be in possession of said allotted land and should enjoy its
possession with the further observation made therein that if the land so allotted is
for agriculture purpose, even in that case too, the allottee should possess the same
by cultivating it and that in no case such allotted land should be handed over to the
others or allowed to be possessed by someone, else the allottee would be
considered as ineligible for such allotment and he should leave possession of the
same and otherwise the allottee would be evicted from allotted land.
7)       It is also seen that on proper enquiry, it was found that over the said
allotted land of the petitioner, a Mosque was built on a part of it and the remaining
part of the said allotted land was also not under the possession of the concerned
allottee, the petitioner herein and it is found that the same is under the possession
of his sister and brother-in-laws, namely, Mustt. Rejia Bibi, wife of Soban Ali; Abu
Bakkar Ali, son of Gadu Sk and Abdul Maleque son of Jamiruddin Sk,.
8)       The Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri in his affidavit filed in the case have also
clarified that the said fact was duly confirmed by the Circle Officer of Agomani
Circle in his report under Memo No. AMC-57/2004/2451 dated 02.09.2008 and by
another report of the Assistant Settlement Officer of Agomani Circle under No.
AMC(S)13/2006/4-240 dated 05.09.2008 and it is only after receipt of such reports,
the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri by the impugned order dated
28.11.2008 cancelled the allotment certificate No. 148220 dated 24.03.1992 by
which the aforementioned land was allotted to the petitioner, since he violated the
terms and conditions of allotment and also the provisions of Section 2(4) of the
land policy, 1989 of the State Government.
9)       With regard to the proceeding under Section 144/107 Cr.P.C. it is seen that
on the basis of an application of the petitioner with regard to his said allotted land
involved in the case, the Additional District Magistrate (Executive Magistrate),
Dhubri on 20.08.2008 initially registered a case being Misc. Case No.60/2008 and
on the same day he sought for necessary enquiry report from the Officer-in-Charge
W.P.(C) No. 339 of 2009                                                Page 2 of 5

of Golakganj Police Station and directed him to take necessary steps in that regard
to keep peace and tranquility between the parties over the said land. Subsequently
on 11.11.2008 by an ex-parte order, the said ADM, Dhubri promulgated Section
144 Cr.P.C. on said disputed land (allotted land to the petitioner) in said Misc. Case
No. 60/2008 preventing entry of the opposite parties of said Misc. Case into the
disputed land in question so that it may not lead to breach of peace and public
tranquility in the locality with the observation that said opposite party is free to file
objection, if any.    Later, on 19.11.2008 after hearing both the parties, the said
ADM, Dhubri stayed his earlier order dated 11.11.2008 passed in said Misc. Case
No. 60/2008 fixing 01.12.2008 for hearing again. After hearing the parties again,
said ADM, Dhubri by his order dated 03.12.2008 passed in said Misc. Case No.
60/2008 restricted both the parties to enter in to the disputed land in order to
arrest breach of peace and public tranquility in the locality, barring the part on
which the Mosque is located and directed the Officer-in-Charge of Golakganj Police
Station to take necessary action. The Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri clarified that
upon receipt of the necessary report and after hearing the parties, the said
Additional District Magistrate, Dhubri on 11.01.2009 finally disposed of the said
Misc Case No. 60/2008 by closing the same and cancelled the order invoking
Section 144 Cr.P.C. earlier on 03.12.2008.         It is seen that said order dated
11.01.2009 of the Additional District Magistrate, Dhubri passed in Misc. Case No.
60/2008 has not been challenged by the petitioner in any appropriate forum.
10)     Records reflects that the respondent Nos. 7 to 9 on 19.08.2008 filed an
application before the Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri through the Circle Officer,
Agomani Revenue Circle praying before the authority that the land that was allotted
to the petitioner earlier vide certificate No. 148220 under Book No. 2463 should in
fact allotted to them since they are in actual possession of said land and not the
allottee, i.e. the petitioner herein.    On the other hand the petitioner submitted
application before the said revenue authority praying for conversion of his said
allotted land to periodic patta. For those purpose reports were sought for and in
that regard initially the Circle Officer of Agomani Circle submitted his report on
02.09.2008, followed by the report dated 05.09.2008 of the Assistant Settlement
Officer of Agomani Circle and it is only after receipt of such reports, finding that the
petitioner is not in possession of his said allotted land, the Additional Deputy
W.P.(C) No. 339 of 2009                                                  Page 3 of 5

Commissioner, Dhubri by his No. DRL-961/GJ/ 75-76/32 dated 10.09.2008 issued
show cause notice to the petitioner asking him to reply on or before 25.09.2008 as
to why his allotment of said land should not be cancelled since the same has been
handed over to others.
11)     It is stated by the petitioner that he submitted show-cause reply stating that
on a false petition made by said Mustt. Rejia Bibi, Abu Bakkar Ali and Abdul
Maleque dated 19.08.2008 that they are in possession of the land in question, the
enquiry was made behind him, where false report was submitted with regard to his
land and also stated that there is nothing on record to show that the petitioner
transferred his said allotted land to those persons. Petitioner further claimed that
the petitioner possessed the said land for more than 16 year since March 1992 i.e.
from the date of allotment of said land and that as per rule of settlement, he is
entitled for periodic patta over said land in his name.
12)     However, on being enquired the petitioner could not show anything before
the Court that he actually submitted any such reply to the show-cause notice dated
10.09.2008 that was issued to him by the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri
nor he did placed any receipt no. and date of said show-cause reply any a certified
copy of the same.
13)     Moreover, from the impugned order dated 28.11.2008 of the Special and
Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri it can be seen that in spite of giving three
additional chances, the petitioner did not filed his show-cause reply pertaining to
the show-cause notice dated 10.09.2008.
14)     Even the police report dated 15.12.2008 filed in said Misc. Case No.
60/2008, annexed to the writ petition reflects that the family of husband of the
respondent No. 7 is in possession of the land in question by constructing house
over it and the said fact has not been denied by the petitioner.
15)     It is a fact that the land involved in the case was allotted to the petitioner
by the Government and periodic patta was not allotted to the petitioner for the said
land and he just apply for it sometimes in August 2008 only. In the impugned
order dated 28.11.2008 the Special and Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri
specifically observed that as per Rule, Patta for an allotted land cannot be given to
W.P.(C) No. 339 of 2009                                                Page 4 of 5

the allottee, if possession of the same is handed over to others and the Special and
ADC, Dhubri from the reports of the Circle Officer of Agomani Circle dated
02.09.2008 as well as that of the Assistant Settlement Officer of Agomani Circle
dated 05.09.2008 found that the present respondent Nos. 7 to 9 are in possession
of the said allotted land of the petitioner and finding the petitioner committing
breach of the terms and conditions of the allotment of ceiling free Government land
to him as specified in his allotment certificate No. vide No. 148220 under Book No.
2463 dated 23.04.1992, after issuing show-cause notice to the petitioner, to which
he did not file any reply, passed the said impugned order dated 28.11.2008.
16)     With regard to petitioner’s prayer for his right title, interest and possession
over his allotted land and for eviction of unauthorized encroachers from it, he can
always approach the appropriate Civil Court.
17)     From the above, the Court did not find any such illegality with regard to the
impugned order dated 28.11.2008 passed under No. DRL-961/GJ/75-76/59 dated
28.11.2008 issued by the Special and Additional Deputy Commissioner, Dhubri
cancelling the petitioner’s allotment of land to interfere with.
18)     Accordingly this petition being devoid of merit stands dismissed.
19)     Interim order passed earlier on 04.02.2009 stands vacated.
20)     Registry shall forward a copy of this order to the Deputy Commissioner,
Dhubri, for his necessary action.
                                                                      JUDGE
