        AJOY KUMAR DEY & 3 ORS.                             …..Respondents
                                        BEFORE
                  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE KALYAN RAI SURANA
        Advocates for the Petitioners        : Mr. D. Mazumdar, Mr. P. Borah.
        Advocates for the Respondents        : Mr. N. Dhar, Mr. B. Malakar,
                                             : Mr. T.U. Laskar, Ms. S. Dasgupta.
        Date of hearing and order            : 26.07.2017.
                            JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
                Heard Mr. S. Biswas, learned counsel for the petitioner as well as Mr. N.
Dhar, learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
2.      By filing this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the
petitioner has challenged the order dated 18.02.2015 passed by the learned Munsiff No.
3, Cachar, Silchar in T.S. No. 95/2005, rejecting the application for recalling the order
dated 10.11.2014 and to cross-examine PWs No. 1 and 2.
3.      On the perusal of the order dated 18.02.2015 passed by the learned trial court, it
appears that on an earlier occasion by an order dated 31.08.2013, the cross-examination
of the PWs was dispensed with and the evidence of PWs No. 1 and 2 was closed
because the petitioner/defendant’s side remain absent till 12:15 PM. On an application
being filed for recall of the order, the order dated 31.08.2013 was recalled by order
dated 26.09.2014 at the cost of Rs.1500/- as a condition precedent and in course of
CRP 232/2015                                                                          Page 1 of 5

time, the case was fixed on 10.11.2014. On that date, both the PWs. No. 1 and 2 were
present but the petitioner/defendant’s side did not turn up till 2:45 PM even after
repeated calls and therefore, by order dated 10.11.2014, the cross-examination of PWs
No. 1 and 2 were dispensed with by declaring the same as cross declined and the
evidence of PWs were closed.
4.      It is projected that on 10.11.2014, after the cross-examination was closed by
passing order dated 10.11.2014, the petitioner/defendants filed an application being
Petition No. 58/2010, by which prayer was made to vacate the order of closing the
evidence of PWs No. 1 and 2 and to allow him to cross-examine the said witness and to
further allow the petitioner/defendants to deposit an amount of Rs.1500/-.
5.      The respondent/plaintiffs had filed their written objection and considering the
submissions made by both sides, the learned trial court by referring to the previous
default and the failure to cross-examine the witness on 10.11.2014 and the non-deposit
of the cost of Rs.1500/-, which was condition precedent, held that there was no reason
to allow any more opportunity to the petitioner/defendant in this regard and the petition
was rejected. The said order dated 18.02.2015 is assailed in the present application.
6.      The learned counsel for the petitioner has strenuously argued to permit him a
last chance to cross-examine the PWs. No. 1 and 2. It is submitted that unless he is
permitted to cross-examine the said PWs, his entire suit would lapsed. It is further
submitted that he had approached the respondents/plaintiffs to give the cost but the
same was refused. It is further prayed for ends of justice a last opportunity may be
given and on the next date, if allowed, he cross-examine both the PWs without any fail.
He also stated that the petitioner/defendant was ready to also pay additional cost, if
any, imposed by the court for the inadvertent default on part of his Advocate to cross-
examine the PWs.
7.      Mr. N. Dhar, learned counsel for the respondents has argued in support of the
impugned order.
8.      Having considered the submissions advanced by both sides, this Court is of the
view that could have been a different matter if an adjournment was prayed for at 10:30
CRP 232/2015                                                                          Page 2 of 5

AM when the court had started its work. But to make the witness to sit for the entire day
till 2:45 PM is found to be inexcusable. It amounts to a sort of punishment to a witness
who had come to depose in a suit. This is a practice, which must be strongly
deprecated, as it wastes an entire day of such witness
9.       The Apex Court in the case of Gayathri v. M. Girish, reported in AIR 2016 SC
3559 has deprecated the giving of adjournment at the drop of the hat. This Court is of
the view that if a witness is present in court then the adversarial party cannot avoid to
cross-examine such witness as was done in this case. By not conducting the cross-
examination since 31.08.2013, the trial of the suit has been delayed for 4(four) years
now. This is an appropriate time to quote an observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in the case of Noor Mohammed v. Jethanand, (2013) 5 SCC 202, where it is stated that
“Timely delivery of justice keeps the faith ingrained and establishes stability. Access to
speedy justice is regarded as a human right which is deeply rooted in the foundational
concept of democracy and such right is not only the creation of law but also a natural
right….”
10.      The present default does not appear to be the first default. As stated earlier, on
the prior occasion also the petitioner/defendant failed to cross-examine the witness on
31.08.2013, for which the evidence of the PWs No. 1 and 2 was closed by order dated
31.08.2013. Moreover, when the cost of Rs.1500/- was imposed and making it a
condition precedent, such cost fall within the meaning of Section 35B of the CPC. The
Section 35B CPC is quoted below:
                       “35B. Costs for causing delay.- (1) If, on any date fixed for
                    the hearing of a suit or for taking any step therein, a party to the
                    suit—
                       (a) fails to take the step which he was required by or under this
                    Code to take on that date, or
                       (b) obtains an adjournment for taking such step or for producing
                    evidence or on any other ground,
CRP 232/2015                                                                           Page 3 of 5

                         the court may, for reasons to be recorded, make an order
                     requiring such party to pay to the other party such costs, as would,
                     in the opinion of the court, be reasonably sufficient to reimburse the
                     other party in respect of the expenses incurred by him in attending
                     the court on that date, and payment of such costs, on the date next
                     following the date of such order, shall be a condition precedent to
                     the further prosecution of,—
                         (a) the suit by the plaintiff, where the plaintiff was ordered to pay
                     such costs,
                         (b) the defence by the defendant, where the defendant was
                     ordered to pay such costs.
                         Explanation : Where separate defences have been raised by the
                     defendants or groups of defendants, payment of such costs shall be
                     a condition precedent to the further prosecution of the defence by
                     such defendants or groups of defendants as have been ordered by
                     the court to pay such costs.
                         (2) The costs, ordered to be paid under sub-section (1), shall not,
                     if paid, be included in the costs awarded in the decree passed in the
                     suit; but, if such costs are not paid, a separate order shall be drawn
                     up indicating the amount of such costs and the names and addresses
                     of the persons by whom such costs are payable and the order so
                     drawn up shall be executable against such persons.”
11.    From the plain reading of provisions of Section 35B CPC it would appear that if a
cost which is made condition precedent is not paid that would preclude further
prosecution of the defence by the defendant where the defendant was ordered to pay
such cost. As it is seen that the cost which was imposed by order dated 26.09.2014 was
not deposited, this Court does not find any infirmity in closing of the cross-examination
and evidence of the PWs as the same is in consonance with the provisions of Section
35B CPC. In this regard, this Court is guided by the case of Manohar Singh v. D.S.
Sharma, reported in (2010) 1 SCC 53, where it has been held that if cost for seeking an
CRP 232/2015                                                                              Page 4 of 5

adjournment to cross-examine the witness are not paid, the appropriate course is to
close the cross-examination of the witness and prohibit the further prosecution of the
suit or the defence, as the case may be by the defaulting party.
12.      Therefore, in both the views i.e. firstly on merit of the prayer for allowing further
cross-examination of PWs and also on the view that when the costs are made condition
precedent, the non-payment would foreclose the right of the defaulting party, hence,
this Court does not find any infirmity with the impugned order and therefore, the order
dated 18.02.2015 passed by the Munsiff No. 3, Cachar, Silchar in T.S. No. 95/2005 is
upheld and the present revision stand dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own
cost.
13.      The stay order passed earlier shall stand vacated.
14.      The parties are directed to appear before the learned Munsiff No. 3, Cachar,
Silchar on 17.08.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by producing a
certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction from the said learned court.
                                                                                      JUDGE
