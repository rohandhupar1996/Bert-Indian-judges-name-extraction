Reason:                Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and to the order dated 18 th
                       January, 2017 dismissing the Review Petition No.20 of 2017.

                            2
2.   The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (for short, “the
Tribunal”)   vide  order  dated   4th   April, 2009,   awarded
compensation to the appellant and his father­in­law to the
tune of Rs.5,59,584/­ and Rs.4,53,131/­, respectively, against
which four appeals were filed before the High Court, one each
by the appellant and his father­in­law and two cross appeals
by the respondent, all of which were disposed of by the
impugned judgment. The appellant alone has assailed the
impugned    judgment    and   prays   for  grant of  enhanced
compensation amount.
3.   As can be gleaned from the claim petition, the appellant
and his father­in­law suffered serious injuries on 26 th
January, 2005, when their car was hit by bus no. UP­25­G­
9132, owned by the respondent and being rashly and
negligently driven by one Alam Beg. The extent of the injuries
caused to the appellant included haemorrhage, multiple cuts,
bruises and fractures all over the body and post traumatic
optic neuropathy. The appellant was treated at several
hospitals and operated upon but suffered disability of 25%. He

                               3
then filed a claim petition in the Tribunal, Karkardooma,
Delhi, against the driver of bus no. UP­25­G­9132, Alam Beg,
and the respondent on 27th January, 2006.
4.   Ultimately, the Tribunal, vide order dated 4th April, 2009,
inter alia held that bus No. UP­25­G­9132 was rashly and
negligently driven by the driver, Alam Beg, and accordingly,
awarded the appellant with compensation of Rs.5,59,584/­
along with interest at 7% p.a. under the following heads:
     “23. Keeping in view all the relevant factors, principles of law
     laid down in above mentioned cases and evidence on record, I
     am of the view that the petitioner is entitled for compensation
     as per following details:
     1.    Cost of medicines                          :Rs.1,08,883.00
     2.    Cost of future treatment                   :Rs. 25,000.00
     3.    Loss of Income                             :Rs. 40,802.00
     4.    Loss of future income                      :Rs.1,78,044.00
     5.    Loss of income for 15 days                 :Rs. 1,854.62
     6.    Loss of enjoyment of life & Limb etc.      :Rs.1,00,000.00
     7.    Pain and Sufferings                        :Rs. 50,000.00
     8.    Compensation for attendant                 :Rs. 20,000.00
     9.    Special Diet                               :Rs. 20,000.00
     10.   Conveyance                                 :Rs. 15,000.00
           Total                                      :Rs.5,59,583.62
                                         or say       :Rs.5,59,584.00”

                             4
5.    Be it noted that the Tribunal in paragraph 17 of its
judgment has adverted to Ext. PW­6/F, which reveals the date
of birth of the appellant as 7­11­1969 and on that basis, has
recorded a finding that on the date of accident on 26 th June,
2005, the appellant was 36 years of age. Further, the Tribunal
in paragraph 16 of its judgment has taken note of the fact that
the appellant on the date of accident was working as Medical
Representative with M/s. Stadmed Private Ltd., and after the
accident he could not perform his duty because he remained
confined to bed.
6.    The Tribunal, while recording that the appellant earned a
sum of Rs.50,556/­ from ‘other sources’ namely bank interest
and commission, over and above his salary, did not consider
the said income on the ground that commission and interest
could not be considered for computation of loss of income. The
appellant had annexed his income tax returns for the year
2004­05 as proof that his taxable income was considerably
higher than the amount considered by the Tribunal, as given
hereunder:

7.    Aggrieved by the Tribunal’s award, the appellant filed an
appeal before the High Court, alleging that while passing the
award, the Tribunal had erroneously calculated his income as
Rs. 44,511/­ per annum, disregarding his income from other
sources and also reducing the actual income earned by the
appellant by following the standard deduction method. In the
impugned judgment, the High Court while recording that the
appellant’s taxable income was Rs.77,480/­ less tax paid of
Rs.4496/­, and while accepting that the accident had been
caused by the rash driving of the bus driver, Alam Beg and
that the appellant had in no way contributed to the causing of

                             7
the accident, only enhanced the rate of interest on the
compensation awarded from 7% to 9% as it felt that the rate of
interest awarded was on the lower side but it did not enhance
the compensation itself, on the ground that no case had been
made out for enhancement. The appellant challenged the
aforesaid judgment by way of a review petition, which was also
dismissed.
8.    The short point which arises for our consideration is:
whether the High Court committed manifest error by not
considering other sources of income of the appellant including
compensation of Rs.80,000/­ on account of damage to the
Maruti car of the appellant while upholding the compensation
awarded by the Tribunal?
9.    We have heard Ms. Rekha Rastogi, learned counsel for
the appellant as also Ms. Garima Prashad, learned counsel for
the respondent.
10.   The principal issue that needs to be addressed in these
appeals is about the denial of claim in reference to commission
and interest amounts earned by the appellant during the

                               8
relevant period, as disclosed in the Income Tax Return filed by
the appellant. The appellant claimed income from other
sources under two heads, namely, Bank Interest : Rs.72/­;
and    Commission : Rs.50,454/­. The Tribunal opined that
commission      and    interest    cannot   be     considered    for
computation of loss of income and confined the claim of the
appellant only on the basis of his net annual salary income to
Rs.44,511/­. The Tribunal noted that the appellant did not file
any   document     of   his  age,   educational    qualification  or
profession. The High Court, on the other hand, in paragraph
11 of the impugned judgment observed thus:
     “11. Regarding the deduction of tax paid from the net
     income of injured – Vijay Kumar Rastogi is concerned, I
     find that the total income of injured – Vijay Kumar
     Rastogi as per the tax return (Ex.PW­6/F) is Rs.77477.50
     and after deduction of tax of Rs.4,496/­ the net income
     has been rightly taken into consideration by the learned
     Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The disability of 25%
     suffered by injured Vijay Kumar Rastogi has been rightly
     taken to be the functional disability while keeping in
     view that the injured – Vijay Kumar Rastogi was working
     as the Medical Representative. No case for enhancement
     of compensation while taking the gross income of injured
     – Vijay Kumar Rastogi is made out, as net income has to

                                9
      be taken into consideration while assessing the
      compensation in such cases. Regarding the application of
      multiplier of 15 is concerned, I do find that in case of
      injured Vijay Kumar Rastogi multiplier of 15 ought to
      have been adopted but by adoption of multiplier of 16,
      the difference in the compensation worked out is
      marginal and the same is set off by the fact that future
      prospects of injured Vijay Kumar Rastogi has not been
      taken into consideration and therefore, this Court is not
      inclined to interfere with the awarded compensation on
      this account.”
11.   Strikingly, the High Court noted the taxable income
disclosed in tax return of the appellant for the relevant period
as Rs.77,480/­ (rounded off) and tax deduction of Rs.4,496/­,
yet proceeded to hold that the net income of the appellant has
been rightly taken into consideration by the Tribunal. It is
unfathomable that the High Court, despite having accepted
the claim of the appellant founded on his tax return for the
relevant period, disclosing the taxable income of the appellant
as Rs.77,480/­ (rounded off) and deduction of tax of
Rs.4,496/­, could have affirmed the conclusion of the Tribunal
that the net annual income of the appellant was Rs.44,511/­.
It ought to have reckoned the taxable income for computing

                                    10
       the head towards loss of income. This, in our opinion, is the
       manifest error committed by the High Court. The appellant is
       justified in relying upon the decisions of this Court which have
       taken the view that loss of taxable earning should be reckoned
       for   the   purpose   of  determining   just   compensation   as
       enunciated in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Indira
       Srivastava and Ors.1, which has been followed in Oriental
       Insurance Company Limited Vs. Jashuben and Ors. 2, and
       Kavita Vs. Deepak and Ors.3          It has been held that the
       “income” should include those benefits, either in terms of
       money or otherwise, which are taken into consideration for the
       purpose of payment of income tax or professional tax,
       although some elements thereof may or may not be taxable
       due to the exemption conferred thereupon under the statute.
       12.    The computation of taxable income as disclosed by the
       appellant in his tax return for the assessment year 2004­2005
       for   the   previous   year   ended    on   31 st March,   2004,
       unambiguously reinforces the claim of the appellant that his
1
  (2008) 2 SCC 763
2
  (2008) 4 SCC 162
3
  (2012) 8 SCC 604

                                   11
      annual taxable income was Rs.77,480/­ (rounded off) and
      income tax due thereon was Rs.4,496/­. After providing
      deduction of the income tax payable by the appellant, the
      amount towards the head ‘loss of income’ of the appellant
      would be Rs.72,984/­ and not Rs.44,511/­ as assumed by the
      Tribunal.
      13.   In other words, compensation under the head ‘loss of
      income for 11 months’ would be (Rs.72,984 ÷ 12) x 11 =
      Rs.66,902. Similarly, towards the head ‘loss of future income’
      computed by the Tribunal on the basis of disability suffered by
      the appellant to the extent of 25% in relation to his lower limb
      and keeping in mind that the age of appellant was only 36
      years on the date of the accident and the exposition in the
      case of Sayed Sadiq Vs. Divisional Manager United India
      Insurance Co. Ltd.4 (paragraphs 10 and 11), the appellant
      would be entitled to 40% of Rs.72,984 i.e. Rs.29,194 (rounded
      off) x 15 (multiplier), which comes to Rs.4,37,910. Thus, the
      appellant would be entitled to receive enhanced compensation
4
  2014 (2) SCC 735

                            12
[Rs.66,902 ­ Rs.40,802 = Rs.26,100 (Rupees twenty six
thousand one hundred) and         Rs.4,37,910 ­ Rs.1,78,044 =
Rs.2,59,866 (Rupees two lakh fifty nine thousand eight
hundred and sixty six)] under these two heads, instead of
Rs.40,802/­ and Rs.1,78,044/­ awarded by the Tribunal. In
other words, the compensation amount towards these two
heads would stand enhanced by Rs.2,85,966/­ (Rupees two
lakh eighty five thousand nine hundred and sixty six only) as
indicated above, to which the appellant would be entitled
along with interest at the rate of 9% (nine percent) per annum
in terms of our decision.
14.   The appellant has also claimed further compensation
towards damage to his Maruti Car which, according to the
appellant, was completely damaged, as mentioned in the
Mechanical Inspection Report (Ext. PW­6/D) and the value of
the car providing third party insurance (Ext.PW­6/E). On a
careful scrutiny of the judgment of the Tribunal, we find that
the Tribunal has not analysed this claim at all. That grievance
was made by the appellant before the High Court, as noted in

                              13
paragraph 9 of the impugned judgment claiming compensation
of Rs.80,000/­ towards the same. The High Court in
paragraph 13 of the impugned judgment, however, rejected the
claim on the finding that the appellant had failed to invite its
attention to any document indicating that the appellant had
incurred the expenses of Rs.80,000/­ towards car repair. Even
in the present appeals, the appellant has failed to invite
attention of this Court to any document on record in support
of the said claim. Resultantly, we find no reason to interfere
with the opinion expressed by the High Court on the issue
under consideration.
15.   A  priori,  the   appellant   would     succeed    in  getting
additional amount of Rs.2,85,966/­ (Rupees two lakh eighty
five thousand nine hundred and sixty six only) as enhanced
compensation towards ‘loss of income’ and           ‘loss of future
income’, along with interest at the rate of 9% (nine percent)
per annum thereon from the date of filing of the claim petition
before the Tribunal till the date of realization.

                           14
16.  The appeals are allowed to that limited extent in the
above terms with no order as to costs.
