PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
1.             On 15.02.2010 while granting leave to appeal, it
was directed that the appeal would be listed at the end of
“After Notice Miscellaneous Matters” on 04.03.2010 i.e. today.
2.             Mr.M.N.Dudeja learned counsel for the State and
Mr.B.S.Rana learned counsel for the respondent state that
appeal may be heard today itself.

3.             With reference to the report Ex.PW-17/A of the
ballistic expert Sh.K.C.Varshney PW-17, and the evidence of a
fired cartridge being recovered from the spot where the crime
took place, Sh.B.S.Rana learned counsel for the respondent
very fairly concedes that there is evidence to link the cartridge
with the Belgium pistol of which the licensed holder is the
respondent.
4.             Without going into any further nity-grity of the
evidence,       Mr.B.S.Rana learned counsel for the respondent
very fairly concedes that notwithstanding the eye-witnesses
turning hostile, through the medium of pistol, the used
cartridge seized at the spot as also the report of the ballistic
expert, it stands established that the pistol of the respondent
was the weapon of offence.
5.             Briefly noted case of the prosecution is that at a
marriage procession outside Sai Vatika, when celebrations
were on, a bullet got fired which hit Rajender on the forehead
and traversing upward lodged itself in the scalp.               The
respondent was the one who had fired. He was apprehended
at the spot and beaten.
6.             Since eye-witnesses have turned hostile, there is no
evidence as to what preceded the firing but in view of the
Crl.A.No.171/2010                                          Page 2 of 5

afore-noted facts, Sh.M.N.Dudeja learned counsel for the State
concedes that at best the act of the respondent attracts the
offence punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC.
7.             The appellant has remained in jail for a period of 8
months.
8.             In the decision reported as 2005 (116) DLT 634
Nehru Jain Vs. State NCT of Delhi in a somewhat similar facts
where a gun shot was fired from a revolver during a marriage
procession, convicting the accused for the offence punishable
under Section 304 Part II IPC, the accused was sentenced to
undergo a sentence of 2 years with a direction that accused
would pay compensation in sum of Rs.3.5 lacs (Rupees Three
Lacs & Fifty Thousand Only). The compensation awarded by
the Court was in exercise of the power vested under Section
357 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
9.             Suffice would it be to state that a wanton act of
celebration during marriage, resulting in the death of some
person does not attract criminality as is conventionally
understood.       There is no motive for the crime.    There is no
desire to seek any pecuniary gain or cause any pecuniary loss
to anyone. There is neither hatred nor anger much less any
kind of enmity against the deceased.

10.            Noting that the respondent has his roots in society
and is gainfully employed running a retail shop and is having a
wife and two young children; further nothing that the
respondent is not involved in any kind of criminal activity,
noting further that learned counsel for the respondent and the
respondent who is present in person said that within two
months from today the compensation of Rs.3.5 lacs would be
paid in the name of Mrs.Surinder Kaur (mother of the
deceased). We are of the opinion that ends of justice would be
met if the appeal is disposed of setting aside the impugned
judgment/order dated 15.05.2009         acquitting the appellant
and awarding appropriate compensation.
11.            The respondent is convicted for having committed
the offence of culpable homicide nor amounting to murder and
punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC. The sentence which
is imposed upon the respondent is to undergo imprisonment
for the period already undergone. Additionally, the respondent
shall pay compensation in sum of Rs.3.5 lacs by tendering the
pay order/banker’s cheque in the name of Mrs.Surinder Kaur.
12.            The pay order/banker’s cheque would be handed
over by the respondent to his counsel Sh.B.S.Rana, Advocate
from whose office the same may be collected by Mrs.Surinder
Kaur or her husband Hardyal Singh.

13.            Sh.Hardyal    Singh  is  present  in Court  and     is
identified by Inspector Dinesh Kumar P.S. Rajauri Garden.
Mr.B.S.Rana states that he has familiarized himself with
Sh.Hardyal        Singh   and   would   hand   over  the  banker’s
cheque/pay order to him.
14.            It is agreed that Sardar Hardyal Singh would collect
the banker’s cheque/pay order from the office of Sh.B.S.Rana
on 03.05.2010.
15.            The address of Mr.B.S.Rana, Advocate from where
