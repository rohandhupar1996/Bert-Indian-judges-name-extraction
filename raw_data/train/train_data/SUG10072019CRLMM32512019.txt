       Quashing of FIR No. 172/2010, under Sections 498-A/34 of IPC,
CRL.M.C. 3251/2019                                                   Page 1 of 3

registered at Police Station Govind Puri, Delhi is sought on the basis of
affidavit of 3rd January, 2019 of Mr. Mahesh Kumar, guardian of
respondent No. 2.
       Upon notice, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent
No.1-State submits that respondent No.2 is represented through guardian,
Mr. Mahesh Kumar who is present in the Court, and he has been
identified to be so, by SI Dirender Singh on the basis of identity proof
produced by him.
       Mr. Mahesh Kumar, guardian of respondent No.2, submits that the
dispute between the parties has been amicably resolved and he affirms the
contents of his aforesaid affidavit of 3rd January, 2019 supporting this
petition and submits that now no dispute with petitioner survives and so,
the proceedings arising out of the FIR in question be brought to an end.
       Supreme Court in Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai
Vs. State of Gujarat (2017) 9 SCC 641 has reiterated the parameters for
exercising inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of
FIR/criminal complaint, which are as under:-
       “16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be
    criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant
    element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing insofar
    as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned.
    16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from
    commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar
    transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate
    situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute.
    16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal
    proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants,
    the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a
    criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice;”
CRL.M.C. 3251/2019                                                 Page 2 of 3

       Since the subject matter of this FIR is essentially matrimonial,
which now stands mutually and amicably settled between parties,
therefore, continuance of proceedings arising out of the FIR in question
would be an exercise in futility.
       Accordingly, this petition is allowed subject to costs of ₹10,000/-
to be deposited by petitioner with Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund
within two weeks from today. Upon placing on record the proof of
deposit of costs within a week thereafter and handing over its copy to the
Investigating Officer, FIR No. 172/2010, under Sections 498-A/34 of
IPC, registered at Police Station Govind Puri, Delhi and the proceedings
emanating therefrom shall stand quashed qua petitioner.
       This petition is accordingly disposed of.
       Dasti.
