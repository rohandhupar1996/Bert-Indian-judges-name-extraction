           PRESENT:
                              THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M. M. DAS
           -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.M. Das, J.                    Since common question of facts and law arise in
           the aforesaid writ petitions, they were heard together and are
           disposed of by this common judgment.
           2.                   The petitioners in all the writ petitions represent
           various Private Sanskrit Vidyalayas in the State. It is the case of
           the petitioners – institutions              that though the students of the
           petitioners-institutions were permitted to appear in Prathma and
           Madhyama examinations conducted by the Jagannath Sanskrit
           Viswavidyalaya, Puri till the year 2000 and thereafter by Board of
           Secondary Education, Orissa, (hereinafter referred to as ‘the

                                  3
Board’) which has been empowered by the State Government to
conduct the said examination and the Board also permitted the
students of the petitioners – institutions to appear in the
Prathma and Madhyama examinations conducted by it from
2001 to 2008 without any interruption, the         students of the
petitioners – institutions were not permitted to fill up their forms
and to appear in the ensuing examination which was scheduled
to be held on and from 27.3.2009. This fact was brought to the
notice of the Secretary, School and Mass Education Department,
Government of Orissa and the Director of Secondary Education,
Orissa. Considering the circumstances of the case, the said
authority directed the Board to allow the students of the
petitioners – institutions to appear in the ensuing examination.
In spite of such direction, the Board did not respond to the same
for which the petitioners – institutions have approached this
Court. The petitioners – institutions were established more than
a decade back as per the provisions of the Orissa Education Act,
1969. Applications for permission were made by the petitioners –
institutions for opening of Madhyama Course as they were
already permitted to impart Prathma Course which was also
affiliated to the Jagannath Sanskrit Viswavidyalaya. Permission
was accorded to impart Madhyama Course to the petitioners –
institutions and temporary recognition was granted from time to

                                  4
time till 2008. The students of the petitioners – institutions were
allowed to appear as quasi regular students and for the year
2007 to 2008 as correspondence students in accordance with the
Regulation of the Board. According to the petitioners, this was
probably because, the applications for grant of recognition
submitted by the petitioners – institutions were pending with the
competent authority.   For the examination of 2009 in Prathma
and Madhyama, students on completion of their courses filled up
their forms and the head of the institutions submitted such
forms before the Board for acceptance of the same along with the
fees and to permit the students to appear in the said
examination. However, such forms were not accepted by the
Board on the plea that unless a specific direction is given by the
Government in this regard, the Board cannot take a decision due
to the Press Note issued by the State Government in August,
2008. On the representations made on behalf of the petitioners –
institutions, the State Government issued a direction to the
Director, Secondary Education, Orissa for consideration of their
cases for permitting the students of High Schools and Sanskrit
Tolls whose cases were considered by the High Power Committee
on21.2.2009 and the High Power Committee was directed to take
a decision in the matter. The said High Power Committee took a
decision for permitting the students of the petitioners –

                                      5
institutions to appear in the ensuing examination, 2009. The said
decision was taken pursuant to the interim orders passed in
these   writ   petitions.    The   Inspector  of   Schools   was/were
accordingly intimated along with the list of institutions, students
of which are to appear in Prathma and Madhyama or both the
examination, 2009 with copy of the said letter endorsed to the
Secretary, Board of Secondary Education, Orissa. The Inspector
of Schools also wrote to the Board to allow the students of the
petitioners – institutions to appear in the ensuing examination,
2009.
3.              Mr. J.K. Rath, learned senior counsel appearing
for the petitioners submitted that the Management Rules, 1991
clearly stipulates that once the institution is permitted to be
established by the Educational Authorities, such institution is to
admit students, the teaching and non-teaching staff are to be
appointed,    the    institutions     should   have    the   necessary
infrastructures for its existence and thereafter, such institutions
are to apply for grant of recognition. According to Mr. Rath,
undisputedly, the students were admitted in the permitted
institutions, they completed their courses and the institutions
applied for grant of recognition. The competent authority has
granted   recognition     in   favour   of the   institutions, though
provisionally, and allowed such recognitions from year to year

                                   6
and, therefore, such institutions are to be treated as recognized
institutions by the State Government. Hence, the requirement
prescribed for allowing the students to appear as regular
students having been fulfilled, there cannot be any embargo on
the part of the authorities to allow students to appear as regular
candidates.    Mr. Rath submitted a chart showing the date on
which, the institutions have been permitted by the Government
and the institutions, which have been recognized by the
Government in respect of 30 institutions, which stand on a
different footing than the other institutions, who are neither
permitted nor recognized by the State Government. According to
Mr. Rath, the students of the petitioners – institutions, which
come under the first category therefore, cannot be denied the
benefit of appearing in the examination conducted by the Board
as regular candidates.
4.              Mr. B. Dash, learned counsel for the Board,
however, submitted that since the decision of the State
Government was communicated to the Board by the Government
at a belated stage when the Board has already taken steps for
conducting the examination, it was not practicable on the part of
the Board to allow the students of the petitioners – institutions to
appear in the said examination which was scheduled to
commence from 27.3.2009.

                                    7
5.               Mr. Rath, however, submitted that such a letter of
the Government was sent by FAX on 13.3.2009 and there was
sufficient time available to the Board to accept the forms of the
students of the petitioners – institutions and allow them to
appear in the said examination.       The order of the Government
communicated to the Board having been passed by exercise of
power under section 33 read with 34 of the Secondary Education
Act, 1953, it was mandatory on the Board to carry out the same.
Under the said Act, the State Government is the authority to see
that the provisions of the Act are to be complied with.
6.               Mr. B. Dash drawing the attention of the Court to
the Regulation of the Board, which was framed in the year 2003
for Prathama and Madhyama known as Regulation of Prathama
and Madhyama Examination, 2003 onwards, submitted that as
per the said Regulation, the Board shall conduct Prathama and
Madhyama Examination once in a year. As per Regulation - 6,
four types of candidates are eligible to appear in the Madhyama
Examination, such as, (a) Regular, (b) Ex-regular, (c) quasi
regular, and (d) Private candidates.       Under Regulation 12(a),
there is another category, i.e., Compartmental candidates. Under
Regulation - 6, 6(a) states that a regular candidate is he, who has
satisfactorily prosecuted a regular course of study in Ist year, 2nd
year and 3rd year Madhyama Classes (Class VIII, IX and X) in one

                                    8
or    more     Vidyalaya/Mahavidyalaya      recognized   by     the
Biswavidyalaya or by the Board and who has been duly sent up
for the examination by the Head of the institution last attended.
Besides the above, the Board conducts certain examinations, if
directed by the State Government invoking its power under
section 34 of the Orissa Secondary Education Act, 1953. Mr.
Dash further submitted that the students of the petitioners –
institutions are not coming under any of the categories under the
above Regulations and the State Government having not passed
any order directing the Board under section 34 of the aforesaid
Act to conduct the examination in respect of the students of the
petitioners – institutions for the year 2009, the Board disallowed
such students from appearing in the said examination. With
regard to the order of the State Government issued in its letter
dated 13.3.2009, Mr. Dash submitted that the said letter was
received by the Board on 14.3.2009 and after receipt of the same,
the President of the Board directed to place the matter before the
Examination      Committee.    The    Examination  Committee     on
15.4.2009 after discussing the matter resolved that the Board is
not in a position to implement the order of the Government and
communicated the said resolution to the Government further
stating in its letter that though the Government issued the Press
Note, which has been annexed as Annexure-C/4 to the counter

                                    9
affidavit filed by the Board, none of the institutions responded to
the same or admitted their students in the nearby recognized
Schools or Tolls to enable their students to appear in the 2009
examination. .
7.               It is found from Annexures-4 and 5 to the writ
petition, being W.P. (C) No. 4303 of 2009 that the Government
decided to permit the students of the petitioners – institutions to
appear in the 2009 Examination with certain terms and
conditions pursuant to the orders passed by this Court. From
Annexures- 3/A and 3/B to the affidavit filed by the petitioner on
24.7.2009, it appears that the Government thereafter issued
recognition letters to 30 institutions. The Board after issuance of
such recognition letters cannot have any objection for allowing
the students of the petitioners – institutions to appear in
Prathama and Madhyama Examinations, 2009 which it should
have done pursuant to the interim orders passed by this Court.
Such candidates are entitled to appear in the examination for the
year 2009 as regular candidates.
8.               However, since the said examination has already
been over, the Board is directed to allow the students of the
petitioners – institutions to appear in the examination to be
conducted in the year 2010 and shall accept the forms along with
the examination fees which shall be submitted by the students of

                                   10
the petitioners – institutions. This examination of such students
shall be construed to be an examination of the year 2009 and in
the certificates to be granted to the successful candidates, it
should be mentioned that the examination is of the year 2009.
9.               The above direction is issued, since in all
probabilities, the examination for the year 2010 will be conducted
by the end of March, 2010 and it is not equitable to issue a
direction to conduct a special examination for the students of the
said 30 institutions.
10.              With the aforesaid directions, the writ petitions
are disposed of.
                                         ……………………
                                            M.M. Das, J.
