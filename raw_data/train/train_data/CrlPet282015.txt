                          Criminal Petition No. 28 of 2015
                                            BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
             Heard Ms. Barnali Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard
    Mr. B.B. Gogoi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam for respondent Nos.1
    and 2.
    2.       Office Note reveals that though notice was served on the respondent No. 3,
    he refused to accept the same, which amounts that he is aware about the contents
    of the same and as such it amounts to acceptance of the notice.
    3.       On 15.10.2014, the respondent No. 3 as an informant lodged an FIR before
    the Officer-in-Charge (O/C) of Dibrugarh Sadar Police Station, Dibrugarh alleging
    that the petitioner in the month of March, 2012 committed theft and
    misappropriated valuable properties from the house and premises of one Late
    Hemoprova Bora at Dibrugarh, one Maruti Zen vehicle bearing registration No. AS-
    06-B-0126, bank account, bank passbook, personal diary, cash money, Nokia
    mobile handset, fixed deposit certificate, decorative pieces, amount received from
    ticket booking counter and courier service of Network travels etc. In the said FIR,
    the respondent No.3/informant also alleged that after Adyashraddha (rituals for
    the dead person) of Late Hemoprova Bora; husband of the petitioner, namely,
    Pravat Chandra Bora and she herself deputed one Mr. Joyprakash Prasad as
    caretaker of their ancestral property at Dibrugarh and they left for Guwahati with
    the Maruti Zen car and along with them, they took away other valuable documents
    of Late Hemoprova Bora assuring all the family members that they would come
    back after six months to settle all the property matters. But as they did not return
    and settle the property of late Hemoprova Bora, after waiting for two long years,
    the informant including the other family members were compelled to serve
    pleader’s notice upon the petitioner No.1. But as there was no response from her
    to the same, he filed the said FIR. By the said FIR, the informant requested the
    Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                 Page 1 of 8

authority of Dibrugarh Sadar Police Station to investigate the matter and to take
legal actions against the petitioner No.1.
4.       Accordingly, the said FIR of the informant/respondent No.3 was registered
as Dibrugarh Police Station Case No. 828/2014 (corresponding to GR No.
2668/2014) under Section 406 IPC which is presently pending before the learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dibrugarh.
5.       Being aggrieved with the registration of said Dibrugarh PS Case
No.828/2014 pertaining to the FIR dated 15.10.2014 that was lodged by the
respondent No.3, the petitioner has preferred this criminal petition for quashing the
said proceeding of said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 corresponding to GR No.
2668/2014.
6.       The Court while issuing notice to the parties on 23.01.2015, also stayed the
further proceeding in respect of said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 under
Section 406 IPC, which is still in force.
7.       The contention of the petitioner herein is that she is an old lady presently
more than 66 years of age and residing at Bangalore with her daughter so as to
support her daughter in taking care of her minor grandchildren. It is stated by the
petitioner that her husband expired in May 2014 and the present respondent
No.3/informant of said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014, is the nephew of her
husband. She also stated that said Hemoprova Bora, who was a spinster, is her
sister-in-law and that during her life time; she used to live alone in the ancestral
house of Bora family at Dibrugarh, till her death in March 2012 and after the death
of Akan Bora, the elder brother of said Hemoprova Bora and that of petitioner’s
husband, in the year 1985; it is the husband of the petitioner Pravat Ch. Bora, used
to look after the affairs of the family as well as his sister Hemoprova Bora and
helped his sister to earn her livelihood by managing a business of ticket counter at
Dibrugarh that evolved out of the joint business of said Pravat Ch. Bora and Akan
Bora.
8.       The petitioner also submitted that after the death of said Hemoprova Bora,
her sister-in-law in March 2012; said Pravat Ch. Bora, her husband in August 2012
Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                   Page 2 of 8

was detected with cancer and he passed away in May, 2014 and the petitioner
placed before the Court that the FIR pertaining to said Dibrugarh PS Case No.
828/2014 was lodged only on 15.10.2014 by the respondent No. 3, that too after
the death of her husband who was the only person having knowledge and
information about the properties of his family and his sister.
9.       The petitioner further submitted that during the life time of her husband
Pravat Ch. Bora, he filed a succession case for some movable properties of his
sister Late Hemoprova Bora before the Court of learned District Judge, Kamrup at
Guwahati being Succession Case No.9/2014 being the only surviving heir of Late
Hemoprova Bora i.e. brother of said Hemoprova Bora and in the said Succession
Case, he made all his nephews and nieces as opposite parties, including the
respondent No.3 herein, the informant of said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 and
when after the demise of petitioner’s husband, on the advice of the counsel of her
husband, petitioner and her two children in July, 2014 filed application in said
Succession Case No. 9/2014 before the learned District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati
for substituting their names in place of said Pravat Ch. Bora; in August, 2014 it is
the respondent No.3/informant who filed objection to such substitution petition of
the petitioner in said Succession Case No. 9/2014.
10.      It is urged by the petitioner that instead of pursuing his remedies in the Civil
Court, the respondent No.3 on 15.10.2014 maliciously lodged the FIR pertaining to
said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 just to harass the petitioner and her family
members by such a false criminal complaint so that she and her family members
concede to his claim in said pending civil case.
11.      Ms. Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
complaint/FIR lodged by the respondent No.3 against the petitioner and her
husband is prima facie baseless which was registered under Section 406 IPC that
relates to criminal breach of trust with regard to some properties of late
Hemoprova Bora. Ms. Choudhury placed before the Court that said FIR dated
15.10.2014 did not disclose as to what, when and how the said properties of late
Hemoprova Bora were entrusted to the petitioner. She also submitted that the FIR
of said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 was lodged only in October, 2014, much
Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                    Page 3 of 8

after the death of said Hemoprova Bora, who expired in March, 2012 and also after
the death of petitioner’s husband who expired in May, 2014. Ms. Choudhury
submits that the petitioner and her two children in July, 2014 filed application for
substitution in said Succession Case No. 9/2014 to which the respondent
No.3/informant being the opposite party No.1 filed his objection in August, 2014
and she stated that from the said Succession Case No. 9/2014 as well as the FIR
dated 15.10.2014 lodged by the respondent No.3, it can be seen that the dispute
involved in those are connected to internal family matter between petitioner’s late
husband and the nephews and nieces of her late husband including the respondent
No. 3.
12.      Ms. Choudhury, submits that since the FIR dated 15.10.2014 of the said
Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 under Section 406 IPC has been registered on the
basis of a false, fabricated and baseless complaint and as with regard to succession
of some movable properties of Late Hemoprova Bora, a civil case being Succession
Case No. 9/2014 is already pending before the Civil Court i.e. the Court of learned
District Judge, Kamrup at Guwahati, therefore, the FIR dated 15.10.2014 as well as
the proceeding of said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 should be set aside and
quashed.
13.      In this regard, Ms. Choudhury has placed reliance on various judgments of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court including that of Madhav Rao Sindia -Vs- Sambhaji
Angre reported in (1998) 1 SCC 692, State of Haryana -Vs- Bhajanlal reported in
(1992) Suppl. 1 SCC 335, Indian Oil Corporation -Vs- NEPC India Limited reported
in (2006) 6 SCC 736, Indramohan Goswami and Another -Vs- State of Uttaranchal
and others, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1 and Chandran Ratnaswami -Vs- K.C.
Palanisamy reported in (2013) 6 SCC 740.
14.      Considered the submissions of the parties and the judgments cited by them.
15.      Section 406 relates to criminal breach of trust and it reads as follows:
         “406. Punishment for criminal breach of trust
              Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with
              imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three
              years, or with fine, or with both.”
Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                      Page 4 of 8

16.      The essential ingredients of Section 406 IPC are that –
         (i) Entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property,
         (ii) The person so entrusted with said property or having dominion over the
         said property -
              (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting that property to his own
                  use; or
              (b) dishonestly using or disposing of that property or willfully suffering
                  any other person so to do in violation
                  (i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust
                       is to be discharged or
                  (ii) of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust.
17.      To bring home the offence under Section 406 IPC, the ingredients of
entrustment with the property, having domain over it and the same having been
misappropriated or converted to his own use by the accused person are required to
prove the guilt of the accused by adducing evidence beyond doubt, otherwise, the
accused must be acquitted.
18.      The object of the First Information Report from the point of view of the
informant is to set the criminal law in motion and from the point of view of the
investigating authorities is to obtain information about the alleged criminal activity
so as to take suitable steps to trace and bring to book the guilty.
19.      In the case of Thulia Kali -Vs- State of T.N., reported in (1972) 3 SCC 393,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held that –
         “First information report in a criminal case is an extremely vital and valuable
         piece of evidence for the purpose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced
         at the trial. The importance of the above report can hardly be overestimated
         from the standpoint of the accused. The object of insisting upon prompt
         lodging of the report to the police in respect of commission of an offence is
         to obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which the crime
         was committed, the names of the actual culprits and the part played by them
         as well as the names of eyewitnesses present at the scene of occurrence.
         Delay in lodging the first information report quite often results in
         embellishment which is a creature of afterthought. On account of delay, the
         report not only gets bereft of the advantage of spontaneity, danger creeps in
         of the introduction of coloured version, exaggerated account or concocted
         story as a result of deliberation and consultation. It is, therefore, essential
         that the delay in the lodging of the first information report should be
         satisfactorily explained.”
Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                     Page 5 of 8

20.      The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State of H.P. -Vs- Shree Kant
Shekari, (2004) 8 SCC 153, have held that –
         “Delay in lodging the first information report cannot be used as a ritualistic
         formula for discarding the prosecution case and doubting its authenticity. It
         only puts the court on guard to search for and consider if any explanation
         has been offered for the delay. Once it is offered, the court is to only see
         whether it is satisfactory or not. In case if the prosecution fails to
         satisfactorily explain the delay and there is possibility of embellishment or
         exaggeration in the prosecution version on account of such delay, it is a
         relevant factor. On the other hand, satisfactory explanation of the delay is
         weighty enough to reject the plea of false implication or vulnerability of the
         prosecution case.”
21.      In the case of Kilakkatha Parambath Sasi -Vs- State of Kerala, reported in
(2011) 4 SCC 552 the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held that –
         “It is true, and if it is so found, that an FIR has been lodged belatedly, an
         inference can rightly follow that the prosecution story may not be true but
         equally on the other side if it is found that there is no delay in the recording
         of the FIR, the prosecution story stands immeasurably strengthened.”
22.      In the case of KanhaiyaLal -Vs- State of Rajasthan, reported in (2013) 5
SCC 655, the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held that –
         ”Whether the delay creates a dent in the prosecution story and ushers in
         suspicion has to be gathered by scrutinising the explanation offered for the
         delay in the light of the totality of the facts and circumstances. Greater
         degree of care and caution is required on the part of the court to appreciate
         the evidence to satisfy itself relating to the explanation of the factum of
         delay.”
23.      In the present case, it is seen from the FIR dated 15.10.2014 lodged by the
respondent No.3 that it did not specifically disclose as to what properties of said
late Hemoprova Bora and as to when such properties of late Hemoprova Bora and
as to how such properties of late Hemoprova Bora were entrusted with the
petitioner, except mere making statements like bank account, bank passbook,
personal diary, cash/money, Nokia mobile handset, fixed deposit certificate,
decorative pieces, amount received from ticket booking counter and courier service
of Network travels. The said FIR also did not disclose which property of said Late
Hemoprova Bora had been dishonestly misappropriated or converted by the
petitioner to her own use.
Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                      Page 6 of 8

24.      It is also seen that said Hemoprova Bora expired in the month of March,
2012 and the husband of the petitioner, who is the brother of said late said
Hemoprova Bora also expired in May 2014, whereas the respondent No. 3, who is
fully aware of the said facts filed the FIR of the case only on 15.10.2014. Moreover,
it is also brought to the notice of the Court that a civil proceeding with regard to
succession of movable property of late Hemoprova Bora, that was preferred by the
late husband of the petitioner during his lifetime, is also pending before the learned
District Judge, Kamrup at Guwahati since January, 2014 wherein the respondent
No. 3 is one of the opposite parties and where, after the death of the husband of
the petitioner, she and her two children being the legal heir of her husband& father
Pravat Ch. Bora filed application in July, 2014 for substitution of their names in
place of Pravat Ch. Bora which has been objected to by the respondent No. 3 by
filing his objection petition in August, 2014.
25.      In the present case, the informant/respondent No. 3 did not satisfactorily
explain any reason for his inordinate delay of around 2½ years in lodging the FIR
on 15.10.2014 pertaining to said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 regarding
misappropriation of property of late Hemoprova Bora who expired in March, 2012
and this action on the part of the said informant/respondent No. 3 could be
definitely viewed with suspicion, more particularly due to pendency of a civil suit
being Succession Case No. 9/2014 with regard to property of said late Hemoprova
Bora is pending before the Court of learned District Judge, Kamrup (Metro) at
Guwahati, between the same parties.
26.      Considering all these, the Court is of the view that if the proceeding of the
said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 is allowed to continue against the petitioner
on the basis of said FIR dated 15.10.2014 of the informant/respondent No. 3; it
would be an abuse of the process of the Court and would cause unnecessary
harassment to the petitioner.
27.      As such for the ends of justice, in exercise of the power conferred under
Section 482 CrPC, the FIR dated 15.10.2014 lodged by the informant/respondent
No. 3 before the Officer-in-Charge of Dibrugarh Sadar Police Station against the
petitioner with regard to said Dibrugarh PS Case No. 828/2014 is hereby set aside
Crl. Ptn. No. 28 of 2015                                                   Page 7 of 8

and quashed. Consequently, the proceeding of said Dibrugarh PS Case No.
828/2014 and the corresponding GR Case No. 2668/2014 are also set aside and
quashed.
28.      The interim order passed earlier in this proceeding on 23.01.2015 stands
merged with this order.
29.      This criminal petition accordingly stands allowed.
30.      Registry shall return the LCR along with a copy of this order forthwith.
                                                                     JUDGE
