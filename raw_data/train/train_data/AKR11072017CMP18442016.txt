      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.           By this application under Article 227 of the Constitution
      of India, challenge is made to the order dated 17.11.2016 passed by the
      learned 2nd Additional Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Bhubaneswar in C.S. No.123
      of 2013, whereby and whereunder, learned trial court rejected the
      application of the defendant-petitioner to stay the further proceeding of
      the suit till disposal of Consolidation Revision Case No.97 of 2016 pending
      before   the     Commissioner,     Consolidation  and    Settlement,   Odisha,
      Bhubaneswar.
      02.             Since the dispute lies in a narrow compass, it is not
      necessary to recount in detail the cases of the parties. Suffice it to say
      that the opposite parties as plaintiffs instituted the suit for permanent
      injunction impleading the petitioner as defendant. The defendant filed
      written statement. While the matter stood thus, the defendant filed an
      application to stay the further proceeding of the suit till disposal of
      Consolidation Revision Case No.97 of 2016 pending in the court of the

                                           2
Commissioner, Consolidation and Settlement, Odisha, Bhubaneswar. It is
stated that in the consolidation as well as the suit, parties are same so
also the property. The plaintiff filed objection to the same. Learned trial
court having rejected the same, the instant petition has been field under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
03.          Heard Mr. Malaya Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the
petitioners and Mr. S.C. Acharya, learned counsel for the opposite parties.
04.          The sole question that hinges for consideration is as to
whether further proceeding of the suit shall remain stayed till disposal of
the consolidation revision ?
05.          The subject-matter of dispute is no more res integra.            This
Court in the case of Bijaya Kumar Prusty and others v. Harekrushna Prusty
and others, 2016 (II) OLR 410 held thus:
              “9. An identical matter came up for consideration before
              this Court in the case of Prahallad Bhol v. Shri Jagannath
              Mahaprabhu Bije Srikhetra Marfat Rajgopal Ramanuj Das
              and another, (W.P.(C) No.4660 of 2005 disposed of on
              28.8.2015). This Court in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the said
              judgment held as follows:-
                     “6. The subject-matter of dispute is no more res
                  integra. In Jayadev Padhan and others v. Managobinda
                  Sathua, AIR 1967 Orissa 196, a suit was filed for
                  declaration of title, confirmation of possession and
                  permanent injunction. Both the parties claimed tenancy
                  rights over the suit schedule land under the Orissa
                  Estates Abolition Act. The Estate Abolition Officer
                  recognized the title of the plaintiff. Assailing the same,
                  the defendants had preferred an appeal, which was
                  pending adjudication. An application was filed in the
                  civil suit to stay the further proceeding till disposal of
                  the O.E.A Appeal. The said petition having been
                  rejected, the matter came to this Court. This Court held
                  that for the ends of justice further proceeding in the suit
                  should be stayed till disposal of the O.E.A. Appeal. The
                  same view has been taken in Chandrasekhar Mohanty
                  and others v. State of Orissa and others, 2007 (II) OLR
                  459.
                        7. In P. Nirathilingam v. Annaya Nadar and others,
                  AIR 2002 SC 42 there was a proceeding under the
                  provision of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act as well as
                  civil suit for realisation of mortgage amount. Referring
                  to Section 5 of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act and
                  Sections 9 and 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, the apex
                  Court held that further proceeding in the suit should be

                                                    3
                            stayed till the Tahasildar disposes of the application filed
                            by the debtor under the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act.
                                 8. In the instant case, the matter in issue is
                            substantially the same in the suit as well as in the
                            O.E.A. Appeal. Though Section 10 CPC strictly has no
                            application as held by the apex Court in the case of
                            National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences v.
                            C. Parameshwara, 2004 AIR SCW 6900, but in view of
                            the nature of dispute and the prayer made in the suit, it
                            will be appropriate to stay the further proceeding in the
                            suit till disposal of O.E.A. Appeal No.5 of 2001 in
                            exercise of the jurisdiction under Section 151 CPC.”
06.                    The ratio in the case of Bijaya Kumar Prusty and others
(supra) apply with full force to the facts of the case. In view of the same,
order dated 17.11.2016 passed by the learned 2nd Additional Civil Judge
(Sr. Divn.), Bhubaneswar in C.S. No.123 of 2013 is quashed. The
Commissioner, Consolidation and Settlement, Odisha, Bhubaneswar is
directed to dispose of the Consolidation Revision Case No.97 of 2016 within
a period of three weeks from today. Further proceeding in C.S. No.123 of
2013 shall remain stayed till disposal of Consolidation Revision Case No.97
of 2016.
07.                    The petition is disposed of.
                                                                     ……………………………….
                                                                       Dr. A.K. Rath, J.
