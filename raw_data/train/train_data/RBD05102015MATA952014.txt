   PRESENT:
          THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE VINOD PRASAD
                                     AND
         THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE RAGHUBIR DASH
   Date of hearing : 22.09.2015           Date of judgment : 05.10.2015
Raghubir Dash, J. Both the appeals, having arisen from the judgment
   dated 19.07.2014 passed by the learned Judge, Family Court,
   Bhubaneswar in Civil Proceeding No.512 of 2010, are heard
   analogously to be disposed of by a common order.
   2.           The husband is the appellant in MATA No.95 of 2014.
   Being aggrieved by the order allowing payment of Rs.15,00,000/-
   to the wife towards her permanent alimony while dissolving the
   marriage of the parties, the husband has preferred this appeal.
   3.           The wife is the appellant in MATA No.147 of 2014.
   Being aggrieved by the order of dissolution of marriage, she has
   preferred this appeal seeking a remand of the matter to the learned
   Judge, Family Court for fresh adjudication on the ground that she
   was not given sufficient opportunity to adduce evidence in the
   Matrimonial Proceeding.
   4.           At the outset, it is worth-mentioning that on 22.9.2015
   learned counsel for the husband has made submission that the
   husband does not want to press his appeal inasmuch as the wife
   in her appeal has prayed for setting aside the judgment and

                                  3
remitting the matter back to the Family Court to which the
husband has no objection.
5.            Impugned judgment reflects that in the matrimonial
proceeding the husband has examined three witnesses including
himself whereas the wife, in spite of several adjournments granted
to her, failed to adduce evidence. Since the judgment reflects that
evidence of P.Ws.1, 2 and 3 remains unchallenged it is not clear as
to whether the P.Ws were subjected to cross-examination. Under
such circumstances, we consider it to be in the interest of justice
to remand the matter to the Family Court concerned to enable the
wife to get an opportunity to contest the case effectively.
6.            On vetting of the record it is further noticed that in
Misc. Case No.209 of 2014 arising out of MATA No.95 of 2014 stay
of realization of an amount of Rs.15,00,000/- awarded by the
Family Court towards permanent alimony was allowed subject to
the husband paying a sum of Rs.7,00,000/- in the shape of a bank
draft.   After passing of that order the husband filed a petition
registered as Misc. Case No.17 of 2015 seeking withdrawal of the
Matrimonial Appeal. That Misc. Case was dismissed on 12.2.2015
with the observation that the prayer for withdrawal of the appeal
was nothing but a dexterous move in order to avoid payment of
sum of Rs.7,00,000/- as directed by this Court making it a
condition precedent for grant of stay of realization of the balance

                                 4
amount payable under the impugned judgment as permanent
alimony. It is not in dispute that the petitioner is a house wife
having no income of her own from any source. It is not shown that
the wife has been receiving maintenance from the husband since
the commencement of the matrimonial proceeding. Admittedly, the
husband is an Assistant in the office of B.D.A., Bhubaneswar.
7.           Considering the facts stated above, along with the
submissions made by the learned counsels regarding the manner
in which the appeals may be disposed of, MATA No.95 of 2014 is
dismissed as being withdrawn and MATA No.147 of 2014 is
allowed.   Impugned Judgment dated 19.07.2014 passed by the
learned Judge, Family Court, Bhubaneswar in C.P. No.512 of 2010
is set aside. The matter is remitted back to the said Family Court
with a direction to allow the respondent-wife in the said Civil
proceeding to cross-examine the P.Ws., if she has not cross-
examine them for reasons whatsoever, and to permit her to adduce
evidence on her behalf, with further direction to the husband to
pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to the wife in the shape of a bank draft
to be filed before the learned Judge, Family Court, Bhubaneswar
on or before 30.10.2015, failing which he shall not be permitted to
take part in the proceeding. Parties are directed to appear before
the learned Judge, Family Court on 28.10.2015 to take further
instruction.
