 Rehabilitation Department, the petitioner was paid an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- against each of

 3.       It is the case of the petitioner that in the subsequent Office Memorandum dated
 29.07.2013 of the Govt. of Assam in the department of Personnel(B), it has been provided that in
 case of persons killed in extremist violence prior to 2004 and whose relatives had not applied for

                                                                           Page 1 of 2

per No.ABP 121/92/Pt-V/136 dated 22.06.2004 by adjusting the amount that had already been
received by them.
4.      On the basis of the aforesaid circular, the writ petitioner claims that he is entitled to a

been paid 1,00,000/- for each of the deceased, he is now entitled to Rs.2,00,000/- for each of
the deceased. The total being Rs.6,00,000/-.
5.      Prima facie, it appears to this Court that the petitioner may be covered by the aforesaid
Office Memorandum dated 29.07.2013. As agreed by the parties including the learned senior
counsel, this Court is of the view that interest of justice would be met, if a direction is issued to
the respondent authorities to give due consideration to the claim of the petitioner as to whether
he is entitled to an enhancement of ex-gratia payment @ Rs.3,00,000/- per deceased.
6.      In the event, the authorities after giving due consideration arrives at a conclusion that
the petitioner so entitled, appropriate order shall be passed for paying the balance amount of
Rs.2,00,000/- per deceased, the total being Rs.6,00,000/-. While considering the case of the
petitioner, the respondent authorities shall also give the petitioner a personal hearing in order to
substantiate his case.
7.      The aforesaid process shall be completed within a period of three months from the date
of receipt of a certified copy of this order. The aforesaid consideration and hearing shall be given
by the Deputy Commissioner, Karbi Anglong and upon undertaking the exercise, the Deputy
