                              JUDGMENT
Uday Umesh Lalit, J.
      These appeals by special leave arise out of Judgment and Order dated
09.10.2013 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras allowing Writ

                                                                          2
Appeal Nos.1127 to 1129 of 2013 and dismissing Writ Petition Nos.6632 of
2007, 9952 of 2007 and 14983 of 2007.
2.    The aforesaid Writ Petitions preferred by the present appellants were
allowed by Single Judge of High Court vide common Judgment and Order
dated 14.12.2012. While setting aside the decision of the Single Judge, the
Division Bench relied upon its Judgment rendered in Writ Appeal No.355 of
2013 and allied matters (Indian Overseas Bank and Another v. C.R.
Chandrasekaran etc.)
3.    Said Judgment rendered in Indian Overseas Bank and Another v.
C.R. Chandrasekaran etc. by the Division Bench was affirmed by this
Court in Civil Appeal Nos.8420-8421 of 2013 vide order dated 01.02.2017.
4.    The controversy in the present appeals is similar to that arising in
Union Bank of India vs. United Bank of India Retirees’ Welfare Associations
and others which have been disposed of by us vide Judgment of even date.
Since the issues involved in the present matter are identical, these appeals
are dismissed in terms of our Judgment rendered in United Bank of India
and Others etc.

                                                                     3
5.    The appeals and review petitions, therefore, stand dismissed. No
order as to costs.
