KAILASH GAMBHIR, J.
1.   The present appeal arises out of the award of compensation passed
by the Learned Motor Accident Claim Tribunal on 16.1.91 for enhancement
of compensation. The learned Tribunal awarded a total amount of
Rs.4,50,000/- with an interest @ 12% PA to the appellants.
2.   The brief conspectus of facts is as under:
3.   On 1.1.86 the deceased Mr. R. Moses while travelling with his family
FAO No. 58/91                                                    Pages 1 of 7

members in car bearing registration no. DLY 1522 near A.I.I.M.S was hit by
car bearing registration no. 19 CD 1A which was driven at a fast speed and
in a rash and negligent manner. As a result he suffered fatal injuries and
later died. Petitioner/claimant    no.1   who is wife of the deceased also
sustained grievous injuries in the said accident.
4.    A claim petition was filed on 28.2.86 and an award was made on
16.1.91. Aggrieved with the said award enhancement is claimed by way of
the present appeal.
5.    Appellant claimant claims enhancement through this appeal. Sh.R.D
Sahalia counsel for the appellants assailed the said award on the ground
that the Ld.Tribunal   erred in not awarding any amount towards loss of
Estate , funeral expenses, mental shock suffered by the appellants and loss
of happy life. The Ld.Tribunal      also erred in not awarding adequately
pecuniary and non pecuniary damages, urged counsel for the appellants.
The counsel maintained that the Ld Tribunal has not awarded just
compensation as the three minor daughters were wholly dependant upon
the income of the deceased. The counsel submitted that the Ld. Tribunal,
has taken the dependency at Rs.2500/- whereas the income of the
deceased was about Rs.5000/- p.m. The counsel averred that the
Ld.Tribunal erred in allowing the interest @10% p.a. only instead of
FAO No. 58/91                                                      Pages 2 of 7

awarding it @18% pa.        The counsel submitted that the tribunal has
erroneously applied the multiplier of 15 while computing compensation.
The counsel also submitted that had the deceased not met with his
untimely death he would have expanded his business and would have been
earning much more in the near future. It was also alleged by the counsel
that the tribunal did not consider the fact that due to high rates of inflation
the deceased would have earned much more in near future and the tribunal
also failed in appreciating the fact that even the minimum wages are
revised twice in an year and hence, the deceased would have earned much
more in his life span.
6.    Per Contra Mr.Kanwal Chaudhary, counsel appearing for respondent
insurance company submits that there is no illegality in the impugned
award. Counsel further contended that award passed by the Tribunal is
absolutely fair, just and reasonable and no fault can be found with the
same.
7.    I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
8.    Mrs. Moses, widow of the deceased deposed as PW4 that her husband
was Director of Yamuna Sea Foods Ltd. and was earning Rs. 6,000/- pm. PW
2 vide Ex. PW2/A proved that the deceased was a Director of Yamuna Sea
FAO No. 58/91                                                        Pages 3 of 7

Foods Ltd. Ex. PW2/B is the extract of the salary register according to
which,   income of the deceased is stated to be Rs.3500/- p.m + Rs.500
H.R.A + Rs.800/- as Conveyance. Based on the above material duly placed
on the record, I am of the veiw that Tribunal has correctly appreciated the
same and, therefore, I am of the view that the tribunal has committed no
error in assessing the loss of dependency at Rs.2500/-p.m. after making
1/3rd deductions towards personal expenses. Therefore no interference is
made in the award in this regard.
9.    As regards the future prospects, I am of the view that there is no
material on record to award future prospects. It is no more res integra that
mere bald assertions regarding the future prospects of the deceased are of
no help to the claimants in the absence of any reliable evidence being
brought on record. Therefore, the tribunal        committed no error in      not
granting future prospects in the facts and circumstances of the case.
Therefore, no interference is made in the award on this count by this court.
10.   As regards the contention of the counsel for the appellant that the
tribunal erred in applying the multiplier of 15 in the facts and circumstances
of the case, I feel that the tribunal committed no error. This case pertains to
the year 1986 and at that time II schedule to the Motor Vehicles act was not
brought on the statute books. The said schedule came on the statute book
in the year 1994 and prior to 1994 the law of the land was as laid down by
FAO No. 58/91                                                         Pages 4 of 7

the Hon’ble Apex Court in 1994 SCC (Cri) 335, G.M., Kerala SRTC v.
Susamma Thomas. In the said judgment it was observed by the Court that
maximum multiplier of 16 could be applied by the Courts, which after
coming in to force of the II schedule has risen to 18. The deceased was
aged about 46 years at the time of the accident and is survived by his
widow and three daughters. In the facts of the present case I am of the
view that after looking at the age of the claimants and the deceased, the
multiplier of 15 should has been correctly applied. Therefore, in the facts of
the instant case no interference is made on this count.
11.   As regards the issue of interest that the rate of interest of 10% p.a.
awarded by the tribunal is on the lower side and the same should be
enhanced to 18% p.a., I feel that the rate of interest awarded by the
tribunal is just and fair and requires no interference. No rate of interest is
fixed under Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The Interest is
compensation for forbearance or detention of money and that interest is
awarded to a party only for being kept out of the money, which ought to
have been paid to him. Time and again the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held
that the rate of interest to be awarded should be just and fair depending
upon the facts and circumstances of the case and taking in to consideration
relevant factors including inflation, policy being adopted by Reserve Bank
of India from time to time and other economic factors. In the facts and
FAO No. 58/91                                                       Pages 5 of 7

circumstances of the case, I do not find any infirmity in the award regarding
award of interest @ 10% pa by the tribunal and the same is not interfered
with.
12.   On the contention regarding that the tribunal has erred in not granting
any compensation towards loss of Estate , funeral expenses, mental shock
suffered by the appellant and loss of happy life whereas. The deceased had
left behind his wife and three daughters at the time of accident.
Considering this compensation towards loss of love and affection/loss of
happy life is granted at Rs.30,000/-; compensation towards funeral
expenses is granted to Rs.10,000/- and compensation towards loss of
estate is granted to Rs. 10,000/-. Further, Rs.50,000/- is awarded towards
loss of consortium.
13.   As far as the contention pertaining to the award of amount towards
mental pain and sufferings caused to the appellants due to the sudden
demise of the deceased       and the loss of services, which were being
rendered by the deceased to the appellants is concerned, I do not feel
inclined to award any amount as compensation towards the same are not
conventional heads of damages.
14.   On the basis of the discussion, the income of the deceased would
come to Rs. 3,500/- and after making 1/3rd deductions the monthly loss of
dependency comes to Rs. 2,333.33/- which the Tribunal has rounded off to
FAO No. 58/91                                                        Pages 6 of 7

Rs. 2500/- and the annual loss of dependency comes to Rs. 30,000/- per
annum and after applying multiplier of 15 it comes to Rs. 4,50,000/-. Thus,
the total loss of dependency comes to Rs. 4,50,000/-. After considering Rs.
1,00,000/-, which is granted towards non-pecuniary damages, the total
compensation comes out as Rs. 5,50,000/-.
15.    In view of the above discussion, the total compensation is enhanced
to Rs.5,50,000/- from Rs.4,50,000/- with interest @ 7.5% per annum on the
enhanced compensation from the date of filing of the petition till realisation
and the same should be paid to the appellants in equal proportion by the
respondent no. 3.
16.    With the above direction, the appeal is disposed of.
