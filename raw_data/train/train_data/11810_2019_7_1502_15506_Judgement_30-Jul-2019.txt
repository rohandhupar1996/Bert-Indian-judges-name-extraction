Reason:
                                                                                 1

2.   These appeals are preferred against the order dated
26.02.2019 passed by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad
in Criminal Misc. Application Nos.3528 of 2019 and 3529 of
2019 and order dated 07.03.2019 - “On note for speaking to
minutes of order dated 26.02.2019 in R/CR.MA/3529/2019” in
and by which the High Court declined to interfere with the order
passed by the trial court granting bail to respondents No.2 and
3-accused No.1 and 2 and further relegating the appellant-
complainant to approach the Sessions Court on the alleged
breach of condition of bail and for imposing the appropriate
conditions.
3.   The father of respondents No.2 and 3-accused No.1 and
2 were loaned money by the father of complainant-Bharatbhai
Bhimabhai Bharwad and due to grudge about the transactions,
on 10.01.2019, the complainant-Bharatbhai and the witnesses
were abused. On 10.01.2019 at 15:30 hours, Kishanbhai-
respondent No.2-accused No.1 inflicted sword blow on the
head of Ajitbhai (brother of complainant) and when Ajitbhai tried
to save himself by lifting his hand, his left hand palm was cut.
Alpeshbhai-respondent No.3-accused No.2 also dealt sword
                                                                2

blow on the chest of Ajitbhai and when prevented, the blow
caused injuries on his right hand elbow. Ravibhai-accused No.3
has dealt indiscriminate blows of stick on the complainant and
caused injuries to him. Shaileshbhai-friend of complainant also
sustained injuries on both of his hands. On the complaint
lodged by the complainant, FIR was registered in Crime
No.02/2019 at Viramgam Rural Police Station under Sections
323, 324, 326, 307, 504, 506(2) and 114 IPC.
4.    Respondents No.2 and 3 and other accused were
arrested on 16.01.2019 and were remanded to judicial custody
on 17.01.2019. The respondents No.2 and 3-accused No.1 and
2 filed bail application which was allowed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Viramgam vide order dated
06.02.2019. After considering the arguments and also the
materials placed before the court, the learned Additional
Sessions Judge observed that prima-facie case is made out
against the accused and gravity of offence has to be taken into
consideration. However, the learned Additional Sessions Judge
granted bail on the ground that the injured Ajitbhai was
discharged from the hospital on 24.01.2019 and other injured
                                                              3

witness-Shaileshbhai was also discharged from the hospital
and that weapons allegedly used in the commission of offence
have been recovered and also the statements of important
witnesses are recorded. The trial court also observed that
accused are young, having no criminal antecedents and that
they are permanent inhabitants of Sokli village and their
presence can easily be secured and on those findings, granted
bail to respondents No.2 and 3 inter alia by imposing various
conditions.
5.    Challenging the order granting bail to respondents No.2
and 3, the complainant-Bharatbhai filed Criminal Misc.
Application No.3528 of 2019 before the High Court. The High
Court observed that though the appellant had raised other
grounds challenging the grant of regular bail and has also
restricted his arguments to the effect that there is breach of
condition of bail. Pointing out that the appellant-complainant
has restricted his arguments to the effect that there is breach of
condition of bail, the High Court relegated the appellant to the
Sessions Court to raise the objection on the alleged breach of
condition and imposing the appropriate conditions. Learned
                                                                 4

counsel for the appellant then filed an application before the
Registrar “Speaking to minutes in respect of common order
dated 26.02.2019 passed in Criminal Misc. Application
No.3528 of 2019 and 3529 of 2019” inter alia contending that
the offence is very grave and that the appellant has challenged
the very exercise of discretion in granting bail to the accused
and therefore, prayed to circulate the “speaking to minutes” to
the Hon’ble Judge in respect of the order dated 26.02.2019
which came to be dismissed vide order dated 07.03.2019.
6.    We have heard Mr. Abhishek Singh, learned counsel for
the appellant and Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, learned senior
counsel for respondents No.2 and 3 and perused the impugned
orders and other materials on record.
7.    Placing reliance upon Anil Kumar Yadav v. State (NCT of
Delhi) and Another (2018) 12 SCC 129 at paras (17-18),
learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that while
granting bail, the relevant considerations like; nature of
seriousness of the offence; the impact of grant of bail that may
make on the prosecution witnesses; likelihood of his tampering
the evidence and others aspects should be taken into
                                                               5

consideration. It was submitted that due to the attack by
respondents No.2 and 3, injured Ajitbhai has lost the use of his
right thumb and four fingers of his left hand are immobilized
which shows the gravity of offence and seriousness of
allegations. It was further submitted that though the petition
was filed before the High Court under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C.-
the provision meant for cancellation of bail, the appellant in fact
has challenged the very exercise of discretion in favour of the
accused, in view of gravity of the offence and the nature of
injuries sustained by Ajitbhai. It was submitted that though the
learned Additional Sessions Judge referred to the prima-facie
materials showing involvement of the accused, has erroneously
exercised the discretion in granting bail to the accused and the
appellant challenged the arbitrary exercise of discretion and
this was not taken note by the High Court. Drawing our
attention to “speaking to minutes”, the learned counsel
submitted that in view of the grounds raised in the “speaking to
minutes”, the High Court should have afforded an opportunity to
the appellant to speak to minutes in respect of order dated
26.02.2019.
                                                                  6

8.    Learned senior counsel for respondents No.2 and 3
submitted that the appellant having restricted his arguments
only to the effect that there was breach of condition of bail and
while so, the appellant is not justified in challenging the order
dated 06.02.2019.
9.    Though the application has been filed before the High
Court under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. i.e. an application for
cancellation of bail, by perusal of the grounds raised in the
application, it is seen that the appellant has raised grounds
challenging the exercise of discretion in granting bail to
respondents No.2 and 3 under Section 439 Cr.P.C. and that the
order granting bail is unsustainable in law. In effect, the
application filed was only challenging the order of grant of bail
on the ground that it was an arbitrary exercise of discretion.
The Court while granting bail should exercise its discretion in
judicious manner by taking into consideration the relevant facts
as held in State of U.P. Through CBI v. Amarmani Tripathi
(2005) 8 SCC 21.
10.   It is well settled that the consideration applicable for
cancellation of bail and consideration for challenging the order
                                                                7

of grant of bail on the ground of arbitrary exercise of discretion
are different. While considering the application for cancellation
of bail, the Court ordinarily looks for some supervening
circumstances like; tampering of evidence either during
investigation or during trial, threatening of witness, the accused
is likely to abscond and the trial of the case getting delayed on
that count etc. Whereas, in an order challenging the grant of
bail on the ground that it has been granted illegally, the
consideration is whether there was improper or arbitrary
exercise of discretion in grant of bail. The appellant has
challenged the very grant of bail on the ground of arbitrary
exercise of discretion ignoring the relevant materials to be
considered in the application for bail. Since the High Court
proceeded under the footing as if the appellant had filed the
application only for cancellation of bail for which, the
consideration is different, the impugned order is liable to be set
aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for
consideration of the matter afresh.
11.    In the result, the impugned orders of the High Court dated
26.02.2019 and 07.03.2019 are set aside and these appeals
                                                                 8

are allowed and the matter is remitted to the High Court for
consideration of Criminal Misc. Application Nos.3528 of 2019
and 3529 of 2019 afresh. The High Court shall proceed with
the matter as if the application challenges the order of grant of
bail and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
