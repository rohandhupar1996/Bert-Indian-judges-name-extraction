Educational Institution (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011 as amended in 2012

         As the petitioner did not find her name in the said list of eligible teachers for
provincialisation as a Hindi Teacher in said school, being aggrieved filed this writ
petition stating that the respondent No. 6 though appointed by the Managing
Committee of said Ghilamara Na-Pukhuri High School by its resolution dated
29.12.1992 and joined the said school as Hindi Teacher on 08.02.1993; but, she
was qualified to be the Hindi Teacher of such High School only on 01.09.2000 when
she passed her 10+2 examination as well as Pravin (Hindi) examination in the year
2012 itself and as such it is submitted that the recommendation of the name of the
respondent No. 6 for provincialisation as a Hindi Teacher of said school by the
District Scrutiny Committee of Lakhimpur district, disregarding her claim, being bad
in law, is liable to be set aside and quashed.
         As per the provisions of Section 4(2) and Section 10(4) of the Assam
Venture Educational Institution (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011 as amended
in 2012, in a Five Classes High School, two posts were allotted for senior Hindi
Teachers and from the uploaded format of the eligible teachers for provincialisation
under the said 2011 Act of the school in question, the name of the respondent No.
6 was reflected in the 2nd Post of senior Hindi Teacher.
         As per the 1st proviso to the Sub-Section 2 of Section 4 of said 2011 Act,
amended in 2012, where the number of such employees serving in the venture
educational institution exceeds the number as specified in the Schedule of the said
Act, the provincialisation of the services of the employees shall be on the basis of
seniority in respective category in the concerned educational institution. Further
Sub-Section 3 of Section 4 of said 2011 Act provided that services of a teaching or
non-teaching employee in venture educational institution up to higher secondary
level was to be considered for provincialisation, only if they have the requisite
academic and professional qualifications prescribed by the relevant Rules at the
time of their initial appointment.
           It is seen that the respondent No. 6 was appointed as Hindi Teacher in
said Ghilamara Na-Pukhuri High School in terms of the resolution dated 29.12.1992
adopted by the Managing Committee of said school. As per the provisions of the
WP(C) No. 2619/2013                                                             Page 2 of 4

“Assam Secondary Education (Provincialised) Service Rules, 2003” that came into
force with effect from 12.08.2003, for a Hindi Teacher both in senior and junior
cadre in a High/Higher Secondary School, the minimum educational eligibility
criteria was HSLC passed and Pravin or a degree in/with Hindi and there was no
such specific rules at the time of the appointment of the petitioner on 29.12.1992
         It is submitted by the learned standing Counsel Education Department that
in the meanwhile said Ghilamara Na-Pukhuri High School was provincialised under
the provisions of said 2011 Act amended in 2012, including the service of said
respondent No. 6. But such provincialisation of respondent No. 6 has not been
challenged by the petitioner.
         However, during pendency of this case, this Court in WP(C) 3190/2012
(Chandan Kr. Neog and others -Vs- State of Assam and others and other connected
cases) disposed of on 23.09.2016 have held that the “Assam Venture Educational
Institution (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011 as amended in 2012”, as
unconstitutional and accordingly, set aside and quashed the provisions of said 2011
Act. Subsequent to that the State Government in the Education Department
enacted the “Assam Education (Provincialisation of Services of Teachers and Re-
Organisation of Educational Institutions) Act, 2017 that came into force w.e.f.
11.04.2017 the date on which the said Act was published in the Assam Gazette
Extra Ordinary.
         In the present case, name of the petitioner was not uploaded for
provincialisation for the post of senior Hindi Teacher in said school and the names
of the teaching and non-teaching staffs including the respondent No. 6 were
already recommended by the then DSC, Lakhimpur district, North Lakhimpur under
the provisions of said 2011 Act and the service of the respondent No. 6 was already
provincialised under the said 2011 Act amended in 2012 pursuant to Government
order.
         It is not the case of the petitioner that the respondent No. 6 was not
appointed prior to her and that the said respondent No. 6 did not join said
Ghilamara Na-Pukhuri High School prior to the petitioner. Moreover, the petitioner
neither claimed seniority nor raised any dispute regarding her seniority above said
respondent No. 6 in said school till the name of the respondent No. 6 was uploaded
WP(C) No. 2619/2013                                                        Page 3 of 4

in the web site of the Directorate of Secondary education, Assam as eligible for
provincialisation as the second Hindi Teacher in said Ghilamara Na-Pukhuri High
School, under the said 2011 Act amended in 2012, which was later declared as
unconstitutional by this Court on 23.09.2016, subsequent to the provincialisation of
service of the respondent No. 6 under the said 2011 Act.
         Since the said “Assam Venture Educational Institution (Provincialisation of
Services) Act, 2011 as amended in 2012” is no longer in force, the prayer made by
the petitioner in this petition cannot be considered. Further, provincialisation of the
service of the respondent No. 6 is also not under challenge.
         Considering the entire aspect of the matter, the petitioner herein may
approach the Director of Secondary Education, Assam within 30 (days) from this
order stating her all grievances regarding such provincialisation. In the event of
filing such representation by the petitioner along with the certified copy of this
order and all the relevant documents, the Director of Secondary Education, Assam,
who is also the Chairman of the State Level Scrutiny Committee under the said
2017 Act, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner as well as the
respondent No.6 and the Managing Committee of said Ghilamara Na-Pukhuri High
School and on verification of the records of said school, including the original
proceeding book with regard to the appointment of the petitioner and the
respondent No.6, the attendance registrar of the school and other relevant records,
shall pass a reasoned order on such representation of the petitioner, in accordance
with law and the provisions of said 2017 Act as Assistant Teachers or Tutors as the
case may be. Subject to filing such representation by the petitioner within the time
as specified above, the Director of Secondary Education, Assam shall dispose of
such representation of the petitioner within a period of three months from the date
of receipt of the same, intimating her about the outcome of the same.
        With the aforesaid observations and directions, this writ petition stands
disposed of.
                                                                      JUDGE
