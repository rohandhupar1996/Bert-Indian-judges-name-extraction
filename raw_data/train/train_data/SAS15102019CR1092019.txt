HON’BLE MR JUSTICE SANJEEV SACHDEVA
                                 JUDGMENT
SANJEEV SACHDEVA, J. (ORAL)
1.      Mr. Ratnesh Bansal, Advocate entered appearance on behalf of the
respondent/Plaintiff.
2.      Petitioner/Defendant impugns order dated 29.01.2019 whereby the
application of the petitioner to lead rebuttal evidence has been rejected.
3.      Subject suit was filed by the respondent for recovery of money. One
of the questions arising before the trial court was with regard to the
genuineness of receipt dated 28.03.2006 allegedly executed by the
Petitioner. Said receipt was relied on by the respondent/plaintiff and
signatures and thumb impressions on it have been denied by the
petitioner/defendant.
C.R.P. 109/2019                                                           Page 1 of 4

4.     An application under Section 73 was filed by the respondent/plaintiff
for referring the said receipt for examination to Forensic Science
Laboratory (FSL).
5.     After the evidence of the defendant was concluded, the application
was taken up for consideration and was allowed by order                 dated
26.09.2016. Thereafter the matter was adjourned from time to time for
recording the testimony of the handwriting expert from the FSL. The
handwriting expert was examined as PW5 on 21.08.2018.
6.     By order dated 21.08.2018, petitioner/defendant was granted two
weeks’ time to move an application for summoning witness in rebuttal. On
21.08.2018, the case was adjourned for defendant’s evidence in rebuttal for
22.09.2018.
7.     On 31.08.2018, on an application filed by the petitioner, the trial
court permitted the petitioner to examine the original records along with the
handwriting expert and to take photographs which were taken on the same
date. Report of the handwriting expert was filed on 22.09.2018 when the
concerned court was on leave. Thereafter the matter was adjourned to
30.10.2018.
8.     On 30.10.2018, request for adjournment was made on behalf of the
petitioner on the ground that the counsel could not appear as he had met
with an accident. The Court listed the case for final arguments for
29.01.2019.
9.     Thereafter, subject application was filed by the petitioner on
21.01.2019 seeking to examine the handwriting expert. By the impugned
C.R.P. 109/2019                                                     Page 2 of 4

order 29.01.2019, the trial court has dismissed the application primarily on
the ground that the report of the FSL is much authentic and no objection
was ever filed by the defendant and further that the report of the private
expert has no meaning as no document can be sent to private expert in
supersession of the report of the FSL.
 10.    Clearly the view taken by the trial court is erroneous as expert
opinion is only an additional piece of evidence and is not conclusive proof.
Merely because the document has been sent to FSL does not imply that the
Court is bound to accept the report of the FSL. The Court considers the
report along with other documents which come on record.
 11.    As observed herein before, the trial court had itself listed the matter
for rebuttal evidence after the expert from FSL was examined. The finding
of the trial court that petitioner/defendant has not raised any objection to the
FSL is also erroneous, in as much as, the handwriting expert is stated to
have been cross-examined by the petitioner in detail on his report.
 12.    It may further be noticed that the report of the FSL as also the
witness from the FSL was submitted before the Court after the
defendant/petitioner evidence has already been concluded. Since the
plaintiff/respondent was given an opportunity to introduce fresh evidence
after the defendant evidence was already recorded, the trial court was
obliged to grant an opportunity to the defendant to lead further evidence,
inter-alia, evidence of the handwriting expert.
 13.    If fresh evidence is permitted to be brought on record by the Plaintiff
after the evidence of the Defendant is recorded, the Court would be obliged
C.R.P. 109/2019                                                        Page 3 of 4

to permit the defendant to also lead fresh evidence.
 14.   Further, the reasoning given by the Trial Court that the report of the
FSL is much authentic and the report of the private expert has no meaning
as no document can be sent to private expert in supersession of the report of
the FSL is also erroneous as the Trial Court cannot comment upon the
evidence of the Petitioner/defendant prior to the same coming on record.
 15.   In view of the above, the impugned order dated 29.01.2019 is clearly
unsustainable and is accordingly set aside.
 16.   The trial court is directed to give opportunity to the petitioner to lead
rebuttal evidence, including leading the evidence of handwriting expert.
 17.   Trial court shall accordingly fix the case for recording of defendant’s
evidence including the evidence of the handwriting expert.
 18.   Petition is disposed of in the above terms.
 19.   Order Dasti under signatures of the Court Master.
