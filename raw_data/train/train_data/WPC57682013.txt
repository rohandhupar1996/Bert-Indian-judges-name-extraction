                                WP(C) No. 5768 of 2013
                                           BEFORE
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
10.07.2017
            Heard Mr. Sabyasachi Pal Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner.
    Also heard Mr. N. Sarma, learned Standing Counsel, Education Department, for
    respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 4, Mr. G. Sarma, learned State counsel for respondent
    No. 3, Ms. R. Akhtar, learned counsel for respondent No. 5 and Mr. Y.S. Mannan,
    learned counsel for respondent No. 6.
            Both the petitioner and the respondent No. 6 are serving as teachers in
    Barthal M.E. School, Katabari, Karimganj, a venture educational institution. The
    matter relates to entitlement of financial assistant during the year 2010-11 between
    the petitioner and the respondent No. 6. According to the petitioner, though he is
    senior to the respondent No. 6, instead of providing him the share of his financial
    assistance that was granted the State Government in the Education Department,
    but the authorities of Barthal M.E. School, Katabari, Karimganj provided such share
    of financial assistance to the respondent No. 6 disregarding his seniority. Being
    aggrieved with such action of the authorities of Barthal M.E. School, the petitioner
    earlier approached this court by preferring a writ petition being WP(C) No.
    1750/2012 and it was disposed of on 09.04.2012 wherein the Court directed the
    Director of Elementary Education, Assam, the respondent No.2 herein to consider
    the case of the petitioner as well as the respondent No. 6 within a period of one
    month from the date of receipt of certified copy of the said order.
            As the respondents herein did not comply with the said order dated
    09.04.2012 passed by the Court in WP(C) No. 1750/2012, petitioner filed a
    contempt petition being Cont Case (C) No. 487/2012. The respondent No.2 on
    receipt of notice of said contempt petition after hearing the petitioner as well as the
    Headmaster of said school and the respondent No. 6 issued the impugned order
    dated 07.02.2013 rejecting the claim of the petitioner for such financial assistance
    during 2010-11. Hence, this writ petition for a direction to extend the financial
    benefit to the petitioner considering him to be a senior teacher in the school than
    WP(C) No. 5768 of 2013                                                      Page 1 of 4

the respondent No. 6 and for withdrawal or recall or forebear from giving effect to
the fraudulent correspondence made by the Headmaster of the school seeking to
describe the respondent No. 6 as senior most teacher in place of the petitioner.
        It is also stated that the petitioner filed an appeal against the said order
before the DEEO, Karimganj. According to the petitioner, the respondent No.6 was
nowhere in the picture till 30.12.2010 but he was given financial assistance
depriving the petitioner and that the petitioner could come to know that behind his
back, the respondent No. 5, the Head Master of the school submitted false
documents before the respondent No. 2, the Director of Elementary Education,
assam stating that respondent No. 6 was appointed in the year 1993 in place of the
petitioner.
        The respondent No. 5 filed an affidavit in the matter and submitted that for
the purpose of provincialisation of the school under the provisions of “the Assam
Venture Educational Institutions (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011” amended
in 2012, the names of the teaching and non-teaching staff was submitted before
the DEEO, Karimganj on 31.10.2012 for its onward placement before the
Directorate of Elementary Education, Assam which did not contain the name of the
petitioner and the annexures submitted by the petitioner are manipulated one
which are false and fabricated. It is also submitted by the respondent No. 5 that
the case of the petitioner cannot be considered as he is not a teacher within the
admissible staff norms. The said respondent No. 5 also placed reliance that the
detail particulars of the school submitted by the DEEO, Karimganj on 09.02.2010 as
well as the Unified-District Information System for Education issued by the SSA,
Assam pertaining to the school in question for the academic year 2014-15 issued
on 30.09.2014 also does not contain the name of the petitioner. Those reports
clearly reflect that the respondent No.6 was joined the school in question on
06.05.1992 in terms of the resolution adopted by the Managing Committee of the
said school on 4.5.1992. From perusal of the order dated 07.02.2013 issued by the
respondent No.2 in compliance of the order dated 09.04.2012 in WP(C) No.
1750/2012 that the DEE, Assam passed the said order after hearing the petitioner
and the respondent No. 5, Headmaster of the school and the respondent No. 6
against whom the petitioner is claiming financial assistance and the seniority and
WP(C) No. 5768 of 2013                                                    Page 2 of 4

the official respondent No. 4, the DEEO, Karimganj. From the original records
produced before the DEE, Assam, he found that the petitioner was appointed as an
Assistant Teacher by the Managing Committee of said school on 07.02.1993 in
place of one Sri Dibendu Kumar Dev who was suspended from service due to his
long absence in the school. The respondent No. 2 also found that the respondent
No. 6 was appointed in the school by its managing committee on 04.05.1992.
Though petitioner was appointed on 07.02.1993 and after his initial joining he
remained absent in the school since long and that in the year 2011, he suddenly
appeared before the Headmaster of the school and that on petitioner’s request he
was allowed to rejoin the school as third additional teacher as per resolution No.12
dated 30.06.2011 of the Managing Committee of said school and that the petitioner
joined in his said capacity only on 01.09.2011 and continued his service up to
December 2011. But it is revealed that the petitioner did not attend the said school
since January 2012 till the date of hearing of the matter on 05.02.2013 before the
DEE, Assam.
        It is also seen that the respondent No.2, the DEE, Assam verified the
attendance registrar in original of 2000-01, 2002-03, 2005-06, 2009-10 and
January 2011 to August 2011 and also DIES format for the years 2007-08, 2008-09
and 2011-12 and all these did not contain the name of the petitioner. The
respondent No. 2 in his report dated 07.02.2013 clearly stated that the petitioner
presented some photocopy of teachers attendance registrar but those were not
accepted since the Headmaster of the school pointed out that those are
manufactured and manipulated and have no resemblance with the original
attendance registrar. The director found that the respondent No. 6 was appointed
by the Managing Committed of the school on 04.05.1992 and he was regularly
attending the school except for a period of 3 months in the year 1997 when he was
on leave as per approval of the Managing Committee of the school.
        Accordingly, the DEE, Assam after making a due enquiry and hearing the
parties, on perusal of the original records of the school, attendance registrar of
teaching staff of the school as well as the relevant DISE documents issued by the
SSA, Assam; the said director by the impugned order dated 07.02.2013 came to
the finding that under the facts and circumstances, the petitioner is not a teacher
WP(C) No. 5768 of 2013                                                    Page 3 of 4

within the admissible staff norms for Financial Assistance during 2010-11 and
accordingly, the petitioner’s claim as senior most teacher for his entitlement of
financial assistance during 2010-11 granted to the school in question was rejected.
        After hearing the parties and on perusal of the impugned order 07.02.2013
as well as the affidavit filed by the respondent No. 5 and the U-DISE format of SSA
dated 30.09.2014 regarding the detail particulars of the school in question
submitted by the DEEO, Karimganj, it is found that the same were not objected by
the petitioner. It is also seen that the name of the petitioner was not in such detail
particulars prepared by the DEEO, Karimganj as well as in the DISE format of the
SSA, Assam after due verification and therefore, considering the entire aspect of
the matter, the Court found no merit with regard to the claim of the petitioner to
interfere with the impugned decision dated 07.02.2013 passed by the Director of
Elementary Education, Assam.
        Accordingly, this writ petition being devoid of merit is dismissed.
                                                                     JUDGE
