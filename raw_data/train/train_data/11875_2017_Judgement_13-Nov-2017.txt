                        1.  Delay condoned.    Leave granted.
                        2.  The appellants are before this Court with certain
                        grievances regarding the compensation awarded by the
                        court in land acquisition proceedings.          A batch of
                        similar appeals came up before this Court, i.e. Civil
                        Appeal Nos. 1949-1966 of 2016 & connected matters,
                        when this Court passed the following Judgment :-
                                “1.    All these appeals are filed by
                                the     State,     aggrieved      by    the
                                compensation    awarded    for   the  lands

Date: 2017.11.18
11:27:35 IST
Reason:
                                construction     of    Ranjit   Sagar   Dam
                                Project     vide    Notification      dated
                                07.08.1995 under Section 4(1) of the

                       2
Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The Land
Acquisition Collector categorized the
lands into six categories and awarded
compensation,       according       to    the
categorization     based   on   the    nature
and utility of the land.
2.     The   Reference    Court,     however,
granted a uniform rate of Rs.1,600/-
per   marla.      Aggrieved,     the    State
pursued the appeals before the High
Court.     The High Court took up the
appeal   filed   against     the   award   in
Usha Rani's case as lead case.           That
appeal had been filed with a delay of
492 days.    The High Court declined to
condone the delay, though the Court
has    referred     in   detail      to   the
affidavit     explaining       the     delay.
Without    stopping     there,    the    High
Court proceeded further and on merits
also     it    was     held      that     the
compensation awarded by the Reference
Court   @   Rs.1,600/-     per   marla    was
just, fair and proper.        As far as the
compensation    part    is   concerned,    we
find that there is no discussion at
all to the basis of the fixation of
the   compensation     by   the    Reference
Court, nor is there any reference to
the  materials    available     before    the
Reference Court for fixation of the
compensation.       Thus,   the   appeal   by
the   State   in   Usha    Rani    case   was
dismissed,    both   on   the   grounds    of
limitation and on merits.        Hence, the

                        3
State is in appeal before this Court.
3.     Heard   Mr.    V.K.    Bali,   learned
senior    counsel     appearing     for   the
State     and    the      learned     counsel
appearing                for              the
claimants/respondents.             On   going
through the detailed affidavit filed
by the State for condonation of delay
of 492 days, we are of the considered
view that the High Court should have
appreciated the actual reason for the
delay.    We do not want to deal with
the matter any further.           Suffice it
to  say,   that    the   High   Court   could
have given the liberty to the State
to  take    appropriate     action    against
the erring officers, who apparently
have caused delay deliberately.
4.     Be  that    as  it    may,   on  going
through the detailed affidavit filed
in   support    of   the    condonation    of
delay of 492 days, we are of the view
that   the    delay    is    liable    to  be
condoned      in     the      interest     of
administration of justice.           However,
we  direct    the   State     Government   to
take      appropriate         action,      in
accordance with law, on the officers
who caused delay.
5.     On going through the merits of
the case, as we have already stated
above, there is no discussion by the
High Court on any of the materials
available on record, so as to sustain
the   compensation     of   Rs.1,600/-    per

                        4
marla.    For that reason also, these
appeals are liable to be allowed by
remanding    the    matters     to  the    High
Court   for   consideration       on  merits.
Since,   the    case    of    Usha   Rani    is
followed in all other cases, the rest
of the appeals are also liable to be
allowed, as above.
6.     Accordingly,         the      impugned
orders in all these appeals filed by
the   State    are    set   aside    and    the
appeals are allowed, as above.              The
delay in filing the appeal(s) before
the High Court in the case of Usha
Rani is condoned.          The matters are
remanded   to    the   High    Court  with    a
direction     to    the    High    Court     to
consider     the     matters      afresh     on
merits.
7.     We make it clear that we have
not considered any matter on merits
and, therefore, the parties are free
to  take    all    available      contentions
before the High Court.
8.     Being    an   acquisition     pursuant
to the notification issued in 1995,
we request the High Court to dispose
of  the    appeals      expeditiously       and
preferably    within     a   period   of    six
months.
9.     Till   the appeals       are disposed
of,   as  above,      there    shall    be   no
recovery    of    compensation,      if    any,
already paid to the claimants.
10.    There shall be no order as to

                               5
         costs.
         11.    Pending application(s), if any,
         shall stand disposed of.”
 3.  Having   regard   to  the   Judgment,   as  extracted
 above, we do not think it necessary to issue notice
 to the respondents, since this case also forms part
 of the same common order.     Accordingly, these appeals
 are disposed of in terms of the Judgment extracted
 above.
 4.  Since   no    notice   has    been   issued  to   the
 respondents,    we   direct    the   appellant-State   to
 immediately communicate a copy of this Judgment along
 with a copy of the appeal to the respondents.
     No costs.
