    UGC Regulations, 2009 for the post of Assistant Professors in Assamese with
    Specialisation Group-A specified for an unreserved post as per (Roaster Point No.

    4)      Along with the said post in Assamese by the same advertisement, said
    College authority also advertised for another post of Assistant Professor in Statistics
    with Specialisation on Econometrics reserved for OBC/MOBC as per (Roster Point
    No. 77) and
    W.P.(C) Nos. 3709/2012 and 530 of 2013                                    Page 1 of 6

5)        Both the writ petitions are related to the same advertisement dated
26.04.2012 to the post of Assistant Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College for
which selection was held on 03.06.2012.           As agreed by the parties to these
petitions, both the writ petitions are taken up together for disposal.
6)        In W.P.(C) No. 3709 of 2012, the petitioner Sri Bhaskar Bhatta contended
that since 02.08.2004 he has been serving as a part time Lecturer of Assamese in
said Nalbari College being a NET qualified candidate, with M. Phil. Degree from
Guwahati University in the year 2009, being eligible and having the requisite
eligibility criteria, including the UGC norms, applied for the said post of Assistant
Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College. It is also stated by him that finding his
application in conformity, the Principal of said Nalbari College on 24.05.2012 issued
a call letter to him intimating that interview for the said post of Assistant Professor,
Assamese in said College as advertised on 26.04.2012 shall be held on 03.06.2012
from 10 AM onwards. Accordingly, the petitioner appeared in said interview on
03.06.2012 before the interview board/selection committee formed under the UGC
guidelines consisting of subject experts for the said post of Assistant Professor,
Assamese in Nalbari College.
7)        The said petitioner also stated that the Director of Higher Education, Assam
by his Communication dated 13.12.2011 duly forwarded the guideline for selection
procedure of Assistant Professor as per the UGC Guidelines 2010, including the
process of granting marks to the candidates for the said post in such selection.
Though selection for the said post was successfully completed, the authority of
Nalbari College did not publish the result of said selection process. As the
Governing Body of the College contemplated to seek expert opinion regarding the
marks credited to the petitioner during the interview, relating to his published
material and forwarded those materials to the Director of Higher Education
Department, Assam for review of the said matter withheld the result of said
selection, but declared the result for the other advertised post of Assistant
Professor of Statistics advertised together on 26.04.2012. Being aggrieved with the
same, the petitioner has preferred this Writ Petition claiming for necessary direction
to the respondents to declare the results of the interview held on 03.06.2012 for
W.P.(C) Nos. 3709/2012 and 530 of 2013                                      Page 2 of 6

the post of Assistant Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College pursuant to the said
advertisement dated 26.04.2012.
8)      On 06.08.2012 the Court while issuing notice to the respondents in W.P.(C)
No. 3709/2012, directed to maintain status quo as on said date regarding the said
selection and appointment of Assistant Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College,
which is still in force.
9)      In W.P.(C) No. 530 of 2013, the petitioner Smti. Hirumani Kalita submitted
that pursuant to the said advertisement dated 26.04.2012 made by the authorities
of Nalbari College for the post of Assistant Professor in Assamese, she having good
academic qualification i.e. Starmark’s in Class-X & Class-XII examination, first class
1st Position with Distinction in her BA examination with major (honours) in
Assamese, securing first class 1st Position in her MA examination in both the
Groups A & B and qualified in the State Level Eligibility Test (SLET) for Lectureship
and being eligible submitted her applications for the said advertised post and
accordingly, on being called appeared in the interview on 03.06.2012 for the said
post.
10)     It is also stated that during her appearance before the selection board in
said interview on 03.06.2012, she was treated with hostile discrimination by the
subject expert of the selection committee, and though, she answered correctly, she
was stated to be wrong by the said subject expert and that immediately after her
interview, she submitted a representation before the President of the Governing
Body of said College, who was also the Chairman of the selection committee for the
said post.
11)     It is further submitted that as the respondents did not take any action for
filing up of the said advertised post of Assistant Professor in Assamese in the
College, she obtained the required information through RTI from said College and
from such information as provided to her by the College authority, she found that
the concerned subject expert in the said interview wrongly allotted marks to the
respondent No. 6 to the said petition, i.e. the petitioner of WP(C) No. 3709/2012,
contrary to the guidelines issued by the Directorate of Higher Education in that
regard and in spite of all those the petitioner has been placed at Serial No. 1 in the
W.P.(C) Nos. 3709/2012 and 530 of 2013                                    Page 3 of 6

selection for the post of Assistant Professor in Assamese in the College made
pursuant to said advertisement dated 03.06.2012. However, as she could learnt
that pursuant to an order of status quo passed by the Court on 06.08.2012 in WP
(C) No. 3709/2012 with regard to the selection made on 03.06.2012 for the post of
Assistant Professor in Assamese in said Nalbari College in terms of the
advertisement dated 26.04.2012 being in force, for which final selection could not
be made by the College authority and that she being not a party respondent in said
WP (C) No. 3709/2012, she has preferred the said writ petition for a direction to
the respondents to act upon the select list prepared for selection to the post of
Assistant Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College pursuant to the advertisement
issued by it on 26.04.2012 and to appoint her in the said post as she has been
placed at Serial No. 1 in the said selection.
12)     On 07.02.2013, while the Court issued notice to the respondents in W.P.(C)
No. 530 of 2013, in the interim declared that right of the selected candidate shall
not be denied on the ground that the validity of the select list has expired in the
mean time and the same is in force till date.
13)     For the respondent Gauhati University, Mr. L. P. Sharma, learned standing
counsel submitted that the State Government in the Higher Education Department
issued an Office Memorandum on 25.06.2012 issuing a guideline for a selection of
Lecturer including Assistant Professor and Librarian in provincialised Colleges of
Assam as per the UGC Guideline excluding the criteria of awarding oral marks.
14)     Mr. G.N. Sahewalla, learned senior counsel appearing for the College
authority, placed the records of selection for the post of Assistant Professor in
Assamese in Nalbari College made in pursuance of the advertisement dated
26.04.2012, in sealed cover.
15)     Respondent No. 4, Principal of the College filed an affidavit in the matter,
denied the allegations made by the petitioner of W.P.(C) No. 530/2013 stating that
the guidelines prescribed for the post selection of Lecturer including Assistant
Professor that was in force at the time of selection on 03.06.2012 was followed,
where as the Office Memorandum of the State Government was issued only on
25.06.2012. Regarding the allegation against one of the subject expert’s remark of
W.P.(C) Nos. 3709/2012 and 530 of 2013                                   Page 4 of 6

her answers during interview to be incorrect in spite of the same being correct
answers and that deliberate attempt to oust her from the fray so as to
accommodate the respondent No. 6 has also been denied by the said respondent
stating that one member of the selection committee as subject expert may not
accept her answers, but the said selection committee consists of other members
during interview, who are required to give their individual marks.           The said
respondent also cast doubt on the role of the previous principal of the college as to
how in a short period of time he could give the information to the petitioner under
the provisions of RTI, when the order of status quo with regard to said selection
and appointment is in force.
16)     It is seen that the State Government in the Higher Education Department
issued an Office Memorandum under No. AHE.262/2012/13 dated 25th June 2012
specifying the Guidelines for selection of Lecturer (Assistant Professor)/Librarian in
Provincialised College of Assam as per UGC Guidelines, excluding the criteria of
awarding oral marks.        Apparently, the same came into force on/or after
25.06.2012, when the Directorate of Higher Education, Assam circulated the same
to all the undergraduate Colleges.       With regard to the said post of Assistant
Professor in Assamese in said Nalbari College, advertisement was made on
26.04.2012, where selection for the said post was held on 03.06.2012 and clearly,
the said selection was held before issuance of the Office Memorandum dated
25.06.2012 by the State Government in the Higher Education Department
prescribing the Guidelines for selection of Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in
Provincialised College of Assam as per the UGC Guidelines and the question of
following the said OM dated 25.06.2012 during such selection held on 03.06.2012
does not arise. As such it is the Guidelines for selection of Assistant Professor in
Provincialised Colleges of Assam, which was in force during the said selection on
03.06.2012 needs to be followed by the concerned selection committee of the
College for the said post Assistant Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College.
17)     Considering all the above, the authority of Nalbari College and its Governing
Body is now directed to forward the name of the recommend candidate for the post
Assistant Professor in Assamese in Nalbari College for which interview and selection
was held on 03.06.2012 pursuant to the advertisement dated 26.04.2012,
W.P.(C) Nos. 3709/2012 and 530 of 2013                                    Page 5 of 6

forthwith, to the Director of Higher Education, Assam along with all original records
of said selection and the testimonials of the candidates.
18)     Thereafter, the DHE, Assam on appraisal and scrutiny of the same shall
pass appropriate order, in accordance with law considering the UGC norms and
guidelines as well as the Assam College Employees (Provincialisation) Rules, 2010
that were in force at the time of said selection, regarding appointment to the said
post.
19)     The interim orders passed earlier on 06.08.2012 in W.P.(C) No. 3709/2012
as well as dated 07.02.2013 in W.P.(C) No. 530/2013 shall now merge with this
order.
20)     With the aforesaid observation and direction both the writ petitions are
accordingly disposed of.
                                                                  JUDGE
