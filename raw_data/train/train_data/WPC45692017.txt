 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUP KUMAR GOSWAMI
For the petitioners                            : Mr. A.K. Deka, Advocate.
For respondent No.1                            : Mr. T.C. Chutia, Government Advocate.
Date of hearing & Judgment & Order             : 2nd August, 2017.
                         JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
            Heard Mr. A.K. Deka, learned counsel for the petitioners. Also heard Mr.
T.C. Chutia, learned State counsel, appearing for the respondent No.1.
2.          By this application under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the
petitioners pray for setting aside and quashing of the entire selection process
conducted pursuant to the advertisement No.ASLSA/48/2008 dated 26.12.2016 and
for a direction to initiate the selection process afresh.
3.          By the aforesaid advertisement, applications were invited for the posts of
Accountant, LD Assistant, Stenographer (Grade-III), Driver (Heavy Vehicle) and
Peon. The petitioner No.1 had applied for the post of Peon and the petitioner No.2
for the post of LD Assistant.
4.          In Paragraph-4 of the writ petition, it is averred that there were 540
applications for the post of LD Assistant, 36 for Driver, 38 for Stenographer (Grade-
III) and 54 for the post of Accountant. However, there is no mention with regard to
WP(C) No.4569/2017                                                           Page 2 of 4

the number of applicants, who had applied for the post of Peon. It is stated that
written test for the aforesaid posts was held on 29.01.2017 and the result of the
written examination for the post of LD Assistant and Accountant was declared on
07.03.2017. Viva-voce/personal interview for the post of peon was held on 3(three)
phrases, i.e. from 06.02.2017 to 10.02.2017; 13.02.2017 to 16.02.2017 and
22.02.2017 to 24.02.2017.       Viva-voce and personal interview for the post of LD
Assistant was held on 14.02.2017, 15.02.2017 and 16.03.2017.
5.         It is alleged in the writ petition that the respondents had uploaded the list
of valid candidates only in the website and the candidates were asked to download
the format of Admit Cards uploaded in the website. Though fee was collected from
the intending candidates, no Call Letters were issued to them, as a result of which,
many of the candidates could not take part in the written test as they did not have
information about the same. Further allegation is that the respondent No.3, who was
working in the Office of the Member Secretary of the Assam State Legal Services
Authority on daily wages basis, had been selected and appointed as LD Assistant. It
is averred in Paragraph-15 of the writ petition that he was also associated in the
selection process and the said fact establishes that illegality was committed in the
selection process. Exception is also taken to the fact that appointment orders were
issued on the very same day of publication of the result providing 5(five) days time
to the appointees to join their respective service.
6.         On a specific query of the Court, Mr. Deka has submitted that the
petitioners had participated in the selection process and had taken part in the
written test as well as viva-voce but they could not come out successful.
7.         In the advertisement under the heading “How to Apply”, amongst others,
it was indicated as follows:-
           “The list of the candidates, with allotted Roll Nos. will be published on
           website of ASLSA www.assamslsa.com www.kamrupjudiciary.gov.in for
           reference of the candidates in due course and no separate Admit
           Card/Call Letter shall be issued. Candidates are required to regularly visit
           the Notified Website of ASLSA.”
WP(C) No.4569/2017                                                         Page 3 of 4

8.         The advertisement was not under challenge at any point of time and
based on the stipulations in the advertisement, no separate Admit Card/Call Letter
was issued. The candidates were required to regularly visit the notified website of
ASLSA and as pleaded by the petitioners themselves, format of Admit Card was
uploaded in the website. It is also not that the petitioners were unaware of the
requirement of downloading the Admit Card as the petitioners had participated in
the selection process. In that view of the matter, the grievance raised by the
petitioners with regard to Call Letter/Admit Card, is without any merit.
9.         If prompt action is taken for issuing appointment orders pursuant to a
selection process conducted, it cannot, even remotely, lead to an inference that
because of the same, selection process is vitiated.
10.        The respondent No.3, who was working on daily wages basis, also had a
right to apply pursuant to the aforesaid advertisement in question. Merely because
the respondent No.3 was selected, without anything more, cannot vitiate the
selection process. It is to be noted that statements made in Paragraph 15 including
the statement that the respondent No.3 was associated with the selection process is
verified as submission only. Such averments being not verified and affirmed as true
to the knowledge of the deponent or to the information of the deponent which he
believed to be true, and being affirmed as only submission, fall short of being
foundational facts, required to be pleaded, to impeach a selection process.
11.        Having regard to the above, I do not find that any case is made out for
interference of this Court and accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed at the
motion stage itself.
