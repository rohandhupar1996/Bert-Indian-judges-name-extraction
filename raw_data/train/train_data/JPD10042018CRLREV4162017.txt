               THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE J.P. DAS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Date of hearing:14.03.2018 Date of judgment :10.04. 2018
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 J.P.Das, J           This common order shall dispose of the two
     aforesaid criminal revisions since in both the cases the
     judgment dated 17th June,2017 passed by the learned
     District and Sessions Judge, Cuttack in Criminal Appeal
     No.47 of 2017 has been assailed.
     2.               The      said      appeal        was       preferred         by     the
     petitioner in Criminal Revision No.416 of 2017 assailing
     the order dated 15.03.2017 passed by the learned
     J.M.F.C., Cuttack in D.V.Misc. Case 352 of 2016
     granting interim maintenance of Rs.2000/- to her and
     Rs.1,000/- to her child on her application under Section
     23 of the P.W.D.V.Act. She alleged that the amount
     awarded was extremely low. On hearing the parties the
     learned Sessions Judge by the impugned order dated
     17.06.2017 directed the opposite party no.1 to pay
     Rs.8500/- per month towards her maintenance and
     education of her child as an interim measure till
     disposal of the D.V.Misc. Case. She has now filed the
     Criminal Revision No.416 of 2017 assailing the said
     order with the submissions that considering the income
     and status of the opposite parties, the amount awarded
     by     the      learned         appellate         court,       is    also      grossly
     inadequate and needs to be enhanced. The other

                             3
Criminal Revision No.560 of 2017 has been filed by one
petitioner who happened to be the husband of the
aggrieved party. It has been submitted on behalf of the
husband that without considering the material facts and
actual take home salary of the husband, learned
appellate court has fixed the amount at a much higher
side which the petitioner is unable to pay.
3.         Learned counsel for both the sides were heard
at length. The copy of the salary certificate as filed on
behalf of the husband in Criminal Revision No.560 of
2017 is not in dispute. As per the said certificate, the
gross salary of the petitioner-husband is Rs.45,764.97
per month and after deduction his net salary is
Rs.21,260/-.   It  was   submitted    on   behalf of  the
petitioner-husband that the learned trial court after
considering the pleadings and submissions of both the
parties had awarded an amount of Rs.3000/- per month
as an interim maintenance but the learned Appellate
Court, without considering the submissions made on
behalf of the husband that he has dependent           old
parents and the fact that the opposite party-wife is also
earning,   has passed the impugned order directing to
pay a monthly amount of Rs.8,500/- which would put
the husband-petitioner to serious difficulty.
4.         As stated earlier, the net home take salary of
the petitioner as per salary slip of the petitioner as

                                 4
Rs.21,260/- is not in dispute. Of course, it has been
submitted on behalf of the opposite party-wife that the
petitioner has also other sources of income.       But, the
fact remains that the amount awarded as interim
maintenance is subject to the final decision to be arrived
at on assessment of all the material evidence to be
adduced on behalf of the parties. The amount awarded
by the learned Appellate court is little more than one-
third of the net pay of the petitioner-husband. Of
course, as seen from the salary slip, the petitioner is
paying some amount towards recovery              of festival
advance and some other advances taken by him.
      However, considering the submissions and the
materials placed before the Court, the amount of
Rs.8,500/- awarded by the learned appellate court is
modified     to     Rs.8,000/-     per month,   as  interim
maintenance to be paid by the petitioner- husband to
the opposite party-wife and minor child subject to the
final decision in the D.V. Proceeding. The learned trial
court would do well to dispose of the D.V. proceeding as
expeditiously as possible.
      Both the revisions are disposed of accordingly.
                                          ………………
