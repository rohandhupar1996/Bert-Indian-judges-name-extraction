                                  THE HON’BLE MR JUSTICE HRISHIKESH ROY
                                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                          Heard Mr. K Sarma, the learned Counsel for the petitioner. The
                  respondent Nos.1 – 4 are represented by Mr. Y S Mannan, the learned Standing
                  Counsel for the PWD (Building). The Counsel for the respondent No.5 is however
                  absent.
                  2.      The matter pertains to appointment to the post of Section Assistant in the
                  Abhayapuri Building Sub-Division of the PWD. The appointment of Wasim
                  Rabbani (respondent No.5) to the vacancy is challenged on the ground that the
                  petitioner himself was appointed to the said post on compassionate basis on
                  8.9.2010 (Annexure-2) and therefore it is argued that the service of the
                  compassionate appointee, should not be disturbed.
                  3.      The petitioner’s father Late Sailendra Das died-in-harness on 8.3.2003
                  while serving as a Section Assistant in the Abhayapuri Building Sub-Division.
                  Seven years after the death of the employee, the Executive Engineer, Goalpara
                  Building Division on 8.9.2010 (Annexure-2) had ordered for the petitioner’s
                  appointment as Section Assistant. Although the appointment was shown to be on
                  compassionate ground, reference was made in the appointment order to the
                  Government letter dated 2.3.2010 which in fact required the post to be filled up
                  through a regular process of selection.
                  4.      However within 5 days of the appointment of the petitioner on 8.9.2010,
                  the appointment order was cancelled on 13.9.2010 by the Executive Engineer,
                  PWD, Goalpara. The appointee claims that he was not served with the
                  cancellation order but the averments in the petition reflects that his immediate
                  authority had informed the petitioner in October, 2010 itself, to stop attending
                  the office as the appointment was not preceded by a due process and the post
                  will have to be filled up through a regular exercise, in accordance with the
WP(c) No.5094/2011
                                                                              Page 2 of 5

                                                          3
                  applicable norms.
                  5.1     The challenge to the appointment of respondent No.5 is based primarily
                  on the fact that the petitioner was appointed to the post on compassionate basis
                  and the recruitment exercise undertaken by the authorities was intended to
                  regularise the appointment of the petitioner and not for consideration of anyone,
                  from the open market.
                  5.2      The   learned   Counsel   submits   that   the   petitioner’s claim  for
                  compassionate appointment was placed before the District Level Committee
                  (DLC), Goalpara and that is how he was appointed. But Mr. Sarma has no
                  information on whether the matter was processed thereafter, by the State Level
                  Committee (SLC).
                  6.1     On the other hand, Mr. Y S Mannan, the learned Standing Counsel for the
                  PWD (Building) submits that appointment to the vacancy of Section Assistant was
                  ordered to be made through a regular selection process, under the Government
                  communication dated 2.3.2010 and this letter was mentioned in the petitioner’s
                  appointment order issued on 8.9.2010. Therefore, the departmental lawyer
                  argues that when the authority for the appointment is traceable to the Govt.
                  communication dated 2.3.2010, which does not speak of compassionate
                  appointment, the unauthorized appointment of the petitioner on compassionate
                  basis was wholly unwarranted. Thus when the mistake was realised, within 5
                  days, the erroneous appointment order was cancelled on 13.9.2010.
                  6.2     Referring to the counter affidavit filed by the Executive Engineer on
                  28.4.2016, the departmental lawyer submits that the process of regular
                  appointment to the vacant post of Section Assistant was prompted by the
                  communication dated 2.3.2010 and the local Employment Exchange was
                  requested to forward names for consideration. In the resultant selection exercise
                  of the candidates sponsored by the Employment Exchange, the petitioner himself
                  participated as one of the sponsored candidate where the merit of the 39
                  participants was assessed by the five member selection committee. The
                  members of the committee found Wasim Rabbani to be the most meritorious and
WP(c) No.5094/2011
                                                                              Page 3 of 5

                                                           4
                  thus the Selection Committee recommended his appointment and accordingly the
                  respondent No.5 was appointed on 18.12.2010.
                  7.      The appointment of the respondent No.5 is challenged mainly on the
                  basis of the petitioner’s own appointment on compassionate basis. But what is
                  conspicuous in the 8.9.2010 appointment order is, the absence of reference to
                  any recommendation, either by the SLC or by the DLC. Under the ratio of Achyut
                  Ranjan Das vs. State of Assam reported in 2006 (4) GLT 674, Faziron Nessa vs.
                  State of Assam reported in 2010 (4) GLT 340, the compassionate appointments
                  are to be processed initially through the DLC and thereafter by the SLC. But in
                  the instant case, the petitioner has failed to present any material to satisfy the
                  Court that his appointment was recommended by the SLC, as was mandated by
                  the High Court, in Achyut Ranjan Das (supra) and Faziron Nessa (supra).
                  8.      On the other hand, the appointment order itself refers to the Government
                  communication of 2.3.2010 and this letter directed appointment by selection.
                  Thus,   the   Executive   Engineer   could   not   have  appointed    anyone    on
                  compassionate basis, on the authority of the Government letter dated 2.3.2010.
                  Therefore the description of the appointment as one of compassionate category
                  by the Executive Engineer is found to be erroneous particularly when, there is no
                  reference to recommendation, either of the SLC or by the DLC, in the petitioner’s
                  appointment order.
                  9.      That apart, the candidates were sponsored by the local Employment
                  Exchange on the request of the Executive Engineer and around 39 sponsored
                  candidates joined in the selection exercise.      What is significant is that the
                  petitioner also participated in the regular process without any objection. The
                  selection committee after evaluating the candidates, declared that Wasim
                  Rabbani (respondent No.5) was the most meritorious and accordingly
                  recommended him for appointment and the respondent No.5 was then appointed
                  on 18.12.2010.
                  10.     While the selected person was appointed on 18.12.2010, this challenge
                  by the unsuccessful candidate was made nine months later, on 23.9.2010. Yet
WP(c) No.5094/2011
                                                                              Page 4 of 5

                                                           5
                  this Court without being aware of the cancellation of the petitioner’s appointment
                  and the appointment of the respondent No.5 on 18.12.2010, had issued an
                  interim order on 28.9.2011 to protect the petitioner’s continuance in service. But
                  the question is whether the learned Judge would have protected the petitioner if
                  he knew of the petitioner’s appointment cancellation order on 13.9.2010.
                  Moreover, the Court was also not informed that the respondent No.5 in the
                  meantime, was appointed on 8.9.2010, through a regular process.
                  11.     The circumstances in the case suggest that the petitioner’s claim for
                  compassionate appointment was never recommended by the SLC and yet the
                  Executive Engineer appointed him on 8.9.2010 by describing the appointment to
                  be of compassionate category. In fact, the appointment order itself refers to the
                  Government     communication     of  2.3.2010    which    does   not   contemplate
                  compassionate appointment but speaks of a regular process of selection.
                  Therefore, apparent contradiction is noticed in the appointment order of 8.9.2010
                  which is the sheet-anchor of the claim made by the petitioner, for his retention in
                  service.
                  12.     The petitioner’s appointment cannot be construed to be of compassionate
                  category since it was not routed through the SLC or the DLC. Therefore, the
                  claim for continuance in service cannot be entertained on the basis of such
                  unauthorized order particularly when, the appointment order was cancelled
                  within 5 days, by the same Executive Engineer. In the regular recruitment
                  exercise held on 19.11.2010, the petitioner participated but the Selection
                  Committee found the 5th respondent to be the most meritorious amongst the 39
                  candidates and recommended his appointment on merit. Therefore, the
                  challenge by an unsuccessful candidate against the on-merit appointment of
                  respondent No.5, should not in my perception, be entertained.
                  13.     Following the above discussion, this writ petition is found devoid of legal
                  strength and the same is accordingly dismissed. No cost.
