                                                WP(C) No.3598 of 2017
                                  BEFORE
            HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
19.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
         Mr.SC Keyal, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India for the
         petitioners.
         Ms. RB Bora, learned Junior Government Advocate, Assam, for
         the respondents.
         Heard on admission.
         By this petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution, the
petitioners have prayed for quashing of order dated 13.3.2015 passed
by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, whereby it has
allowed respondent’s OA No.342/2013.
         The respondent aggrieved with the revised list of eligible officers
forwarded by the Government of Assam to the Union Public Service
Commission for consideration of promotion to the Indian Forest Service
against the vacancies of 2009 and 2010 and also the gradation list dated
4.2.2013 filed OA No.342/2013 before the Tribunal for quashing of the
same. The respondent also prayed for a direction that his case be also
considered for promotion to the Indian Forest Service against the
vacancies of 2009 and 2010.The Tribunal, after hearing the respective
counsel for the parties including the petitioners, by the impugned order
dated 13.3.2015, has allowed the respondent’s original application with
a direction against the petitioners to hold Review Departmental
Promotion Committee within six months.
         Since the petitioners did nothing in compliance of the order of
Tribunal, we are informed that respondent has filed a petition for
initiating contempt proceedings against them. And despite this, instead
of complying with the order of Tribunal, the petitioners, after two years,
have filed the present petition. For explaining the inordinate delay, the
main plea of the petitioners is that no opportunity of hearing was given
                                                                Page 1 of 2

to them. We find this plea false on the face of it as it is clearly
mentioned in the impugned order that petitioners were heard through
their counsel not only at the time of final hearing, but also on
20.11.2013, when an interim relief was granted in favour of the
respondent. We, therefore, reject this plea. The petitioners have
apparently failed to explain the delay of two long years in filing the
present writ petition. Hence, we are not inclined to entertain the writ
petition.
        The petition is accordingly dismissed summarily.
