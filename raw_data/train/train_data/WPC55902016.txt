                                                  WP(C) No.5590 of 2016
                                     BEFORE
            HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
27.07.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr.SC Keyal, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India for the
        petitioners.
        Mr. A Ahmed, learned counsel for the respondents.
        This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is directed
against the order dated 29.7.2015 passed by the Central Administrative
Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, in O.A No.040/00267/2015, whereby, it has
directed the petitioners to compensate the non-applicants @ 10% in lieu
of Rent Free Accommodation with effect from 1.7.1987.
        According to the Tribunal, the non-applicants are entitled for the
relief in the light of earlier decision of the Gauhati High Court rendered in
WP(C) No.2975/2011.
        It is argued on behalf of Union of India that the case of non-
applicants before the Tribunal was not identical to those who were
granted relief by the Gauhati High Court in WP(C) No.2975/2015. It has
also been argued that non-applicants are being paid House Rent @ 10%
of their Basic pay plus Grade Pay and, therefore, they were not entitled
to any further relief. It has further been argued that the Tribunal did not
give any opportunity to the Union of India to plead its case which has
resulted into passing of incorrect order.
        From the perusal of the impugned order, we find that no
opportunity was given to the Union of India to defend and plead its case.
The Tribunal, in all fairness, must at least give a reasonable opportunity
to the contesting party to defend its case. The Tribunal also without
                                                                    Page 1 of 2

hearing the opposite party should not hurriedly grant relief to the
petitioners before it on assumption. We, accordingly, quash the
impugned order and remand the matter for afresh decision by the
Tribunal after giving an opportunity of hearing to the petitioners herein
(Union of India).
       With the above direction, the petition is allowed.
            JUDGE                                      CHIEF JUSTICE
