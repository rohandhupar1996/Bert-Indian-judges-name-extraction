Statement of the prosecutrix was recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.
After completion of investigation, the charge-sheet was filed against the
accused and his associates. The accused was duly charged and brought to
trial. The prosecution examined sixteen witnesses to prove the charges. In
his 313 Cr.P.C. statement, the accused pleaded false implication. They did
not lead any evidence in defence. On appreciating the evidence and
considering the rival contentions of the parties, the Trial Court, by the
impugned judgment held the appellant guilty for offences punishable
under Sections 368/376 IPC and sentenced. Being aggrieved, the appellant
has preferred the appeal.
3.             During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the
appellant on his instructions stated that the appellant has opted not to
challenge the findings of the Trial Court on conviction. She, however,
prayed to modify the order on sentence and reduce the substantive
sentence awarded to him.
4.             I have considered the submissions of the parties and have
examined the record. Since the appellant has not opted to challenge the
findings of the Trial Court on conviction under Section 368/376 IPC, the
order of conviction of the Trial Court stands affirmed.

5.             Regarding order on sentence, it reveals that the appellant was
sentenced to undergo RI for seven years with fine ` 250/-. The fine has
since been deposited. Nominal roll dated 14.01.2010 reveals that the
appellant has remained in custody in this case for a total period of six
years and sixteen days till 31.10.2001. He earned remission for two
months and ten days. He was admitted to regular bail on 31.10.2001. The
unexpired portion of the sentence is now nine months and four days. The
incident pertains to the year 1992. The appellant has faced trial for about
twenty years. He is on regular bail after the appeal was admitted since
31.10.2001. He has already undergone the substantial period of sentence
which is more than six years. No useful purpose will served not to send
him to jail to serve remainder of sentence after allowing him to remain on
bail for about eleven years. Nominal roll further reveals that the appellant
is not involved in any other criminal case. He is not a previous convict.
His jail conduct was satisfactory. No involvement of the accused was
found during the period he remained on bail, during the pendency of the
appeal.
6.             Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the order
on sentence is modified and the sentence of the appellant is reduced to the

period already undergone by him in this case which is more than six years
and three months.

and surety bond of the appellant stand discharged.
