                                JUDGMENT & ORDER
                     This appeal under section 384 of the Indian Succession Act has been
         filed challenging the order dated 17-07-2007 in Misc (S) Case No.259/2003
         passed by the learned District Judge, Silchar Cachar.
         [2]        The brief facts of the case are that the respondent who is the wife of
         late Samsur Uddin Barbhuiyan, an employee in the Regional Engineering College
         (R.E.C), Siclhar, who died on 17-06-2003, filed an application before the learned
         District Judge, Silchar, under Section 372 of the Indian Succession Act, praying
         for issuance of Succession Certificate in respect of the debt and securities left by
         her husband Late Samsur Uddin Barbhuiyan. The petition was resisted by the
         present appellants, who are the brothers and sisters of late Samsur Uddin
         Barbhuiyan, on the ground that they were also entitled to inherit the property
         left by Samsur Uddin Barbhuiyan and sought for issuance of succession
         certificate proportionately in favour of them along with the petitioner. Learned
         District Judge by order dated 19-12-2003 held that the respondent widow of late
         Samsur Uddin Barbhuiyan was entitled to Rs.50,000/- as deferred (Maharana)
         and 1/4th share out of rest of debt and securities. The learned District Judge also
         directed for issuance of succession certificate in favour of the present appellant,
         as per their entitlement under the personal law. Subsequently, the respondent
         filed a petition praying for releasing Rs.50000/- which was alloted to her as
         Maharana, from the item No.1 of the schedule of the petition for succession
         certificate and the same was allowed by the learned trial court by order dated
         27-05-2004. The appellant challenged the order dated 27-05-2004 before this
         Court alleging, that the order dated 27-05-2004 was passed without hearing the
         appellants.     This Court by order dated 20-03-2007 passed in Intest Case
         No.11/2004, set aside the order dated 27-05-2004 and remitted the case with
         direction to decide the matter afresh, after giving opportunity of being heard to
         the appellants.     The learned District Judge as per the direction of this Court
         heard both sides and by order dated 17-07-2017 recalled the order dated 27-05-
         2004. Learned District Judge also directed that Succession Certificate be issued

                                                                                            3
         as per order dated 19-12-2003, which was still in force for having not been
         challenged or set aside.
         [3]       Aggrieved by the order dated 17-07-2007, the appellants have filed this
         appeal.
         [4]        The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the learned
         District Judge erroneously granted Rs.80,000/- to the respondent of which
         Rs.50,000/- was towards Maharana, as neither the question of Maharana was
         involved in the succession case nor any evidence was led to that effect and
         therefore, prayed for setting aside the order dated 17-07-2007. Learned counsel
         also argued for issuing direction to issue succession certificate to the respondent
         and the appellants in equal share.
         [5]         The basic reason for challenge against the order dated 17-07-2007 is
         that Rs.50,000/- ought not to have been given to the respondent as deferred
         Maharana.      From the order dated 19-12-2003, it appears that the learned
         Tribunal granted Rs.50,000/- out of the estate of the deceased to the respondent
         as Maharana, which according to respondent remained unpaid, and in respect of
         rest of the debt and securities, succession certificates were directed to be issued
         in favour of the appellants as well as the respondent as per their entitlement
         under the personal law. This order dated 19-12-2003, was never challenged and
         as such, it attained finality. After about 5 months of the order dated 19-12-2003
         on a petition of the respondent, the learned District Judge only allowed the
         respondent to take Rs.50,000/-, as was granted by order dated 19-12-2003 from
         a particular item in the schedule of the petition for succession certificate and
         therefore, by the said order dated 27-05-2004, no alteration or change was
         made in the order dated 19-12-2003, inasmuch as, the entitlement of the parties
         as decided by the order dated 19-12-2006 remained as it is. Thereafter, the
         appellants challenged the order dated 27-05-2004 and ultimately the learned
         District Judge has recalled the said order dated 27-05-2004 and consequently,
         order dated 19-12-2003, whereby direction was given for issuance of succession
         certificate as per the entitlement of the parties, remained in force as it was never

                                                                                             4
         challenged.      In that view of the matter, the present appeal does not appear to
         have any merit as the grievance of the appellants was against the order dated
         27-05-2004 which was already recalled by the learned District Judge. So far the
         order dated 19-12-2003 is concerned, as it appears from the record that order
         was never challenged.
         [6]         Looking from another angle, the order dated 19-12-2003 makes it
         appear that Rs.50,000/- was allotted to the respondent as Maharana (deferred
         dower) and rest of the debt and securities were distributed amongst all the legal
         heirs i.e. the appellant and respondent and succession certificates were directed
         to be issued accordingly.
          [7]        The properties of a deceased Muslim devolves upon the legatees and
         heirs.     Before claiming their share by the legatees or the heirs, four primary
         liabilities are required to be met, out of the estate of the deceased and only after
         meeting such primary liabilities, if any residue remains, the heirs or legatees shall
         get their due share from such residues. Following are the said primary liabilities
         which are required to be met, out of the estate of the deceased.
                           Firstly funeral expense of the deceased and the death bed charges
                   of the deceased, which includes fees of medical attendance, boarding,
                   lodging etc of the deceased before the death. Secondly, if the deceased
                   has left a will and a probate or letters of administration have been
                   obtained in respect of the property of the deceased, cost of such
                   proceeding be paid out of the property of the deceased.        Thirdly, the
                   primary liability to be met out of the estate of the deceased is unpaid
                   wages for services rendered to the deceased during the last 3 (three)
                   months of his life by any domestic servant or attendant. Fourthly the
                   unpaid debt of the deceased, if any.
         [8]         No doubt the right to property by inheritance obviously devolves upon
         the legal heirs immediately on death of the deceased but the legal heirs or the
         legatees are under obligation to meet the above primary liabilities of the
         deceased, out of the property of the deceased, and only after meeting such

                                                                                            5
         primary liabilities, whatever remain, as residue, will be distributed amongst the
         legal heirs or legatees as per their entitlement. It is pertinent to mention that
         the unpaid Maher also falls in the category of debt and therefore, payment of
         such unpaid Maher also falls within the primary liability of the legal heirs, before
         the distribution of the property of the deceased amongst them. Therefore, the
         argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that Maher could not be paid
         from their share, carries no force, as payment of deferred Maher, which falls in
         the category of debt is one of the primary liability which is to be met from the
         property of the deceased. In this view of the matter, the learned Trial court while
         granting succession certificate in favour of the legal heirs as per their
         entitlement, rightly allowed the Maharana to be paid in favour of the respondent
         who was entitled to the same and has not committed any error, as it was one of
         the primary liability of the appellants also, to pay the Maher out of the estate of
         the deceased.
         [9]       In any view of the matter, I do not find any merit in this appeal for the
         reason, - firstly, the order dated 09-12-2003 was never challenged and therefore,
         it remained in force.      Secondly, when the grievance of the appellants were
         basically against the order dated 27-05-2004 which has already been recalled by
         order dated 07-07-2007, there could not be any grievance of the appellants for
         preferring the instant appeal.
         [10]       In view of what has been discussed herein above, the appeal is found
         to be devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed.
         [11]        Send back the LCR.
