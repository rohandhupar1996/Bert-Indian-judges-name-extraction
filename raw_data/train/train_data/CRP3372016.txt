               Heard Mr. A.K. Purkayastha, the learned counsel for the petitioner
and Mr. M. Ali, the learned counsel for the respondent.
2)          By filing this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
the petitioners/ defendants have challenged the order dated 13.06.2016 passed
by the learned Court of Civil Judge No.3, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati,
thereby rejecting their petition No. 2540/16 dated 07.06.2016 for examining one
more person, namely, Sri Chandan Sen as their defendant’s witness. In challenge
is also the order dated 26.08.2016, passed by the said learned court, by which
their petition No. 2307/16 for review of the aforesaid order dated 13.06.2016
was also rejected.
CRP 337/2016                                                                      Page 1 of 12

3)           Owing to the nature of grievances raised in the present application,
with the consent of the learned counsel for both sides, the matter was heard in
the admission stage.
4)           As the issue in the present application is whether the learned court
below had committed any jurisdictional error in passing the orders impugned
herein, it is not deemed necessary to burden this judgment with the pleadings of
the parties.
5)           From the materials available on record, it appears that the
respondents had filed Title Suit No. 235/2008, now pending for adjudication
before the Court of learned Civil Judge No.3, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati
(hereinafter referred to as the “learned court below”) for declaration of right,
title, interest over land described in Schedule-B of the plaint, for eviction of the
defendants and for recovery of khas possession, injunction, etc.
6)           On 15.05.2010, the petitioners/ defendants had submitted their list of
witnesses containing 11 names. The suit was pending for production of
Defendants’ witnesses (DWs for short) for facing cross examination. By order
dated 08.01.2016, the petitioners/ defendants were given a last chance to
produce their DWs for cross examination on 25.01.2016 with a cost of Rs.1,000/-
. On 25.01.2016, in violation of the order passed by the learned trial court, the
petitioners did not produce their remaining DWs for facing cross examination
and,     as   such,   by   order   dated   25.01.2016,   the    evidence    of   the
petitioner’s/defendant’s side was closed and the suit was fixed on 16.02.2016 for
argument.
7)           Aggrieved by the closure of the evidence of their side, the petitioners
herein approached this Court by filing an application under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India, which was registered as CRP No. 153/16, which was
allowed by this Court by order dated 26.05.2016, which is quoted below:-
CRP 337/2016                                                                  Page 2 of 12

                      “By this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of
              India, petitioner has challenged the correctness of the order dated
              25.01.2016 passed by learned Civil Judge No. 3, Kamrup (M) at
              Guwahati in title suit No. 235/2008. By that order, the learned trial
              court closed the evidence of the defendant's side on the failure of
              the DWs subjecting them from cross examination. Having gone
              through the impugned order, I do not find any jurisdictional error
              whatsoever. But in course of motion hearing of this petition, Mr. PK
              Deka, learned counsel for the opposite parties, submitted in his
              usual fairness that he will have no objection if a fixed date is given
              for cross examination for all the remaining DWs and if on the fixed
             date the DWs appear and subject themselves for cross examination
             in that event, the plaintiff side would not have any objection.
                     Considering the submission made by the learned counsel for
             the opposite parties, I dispose of this revision petition with a
             direction that the defendants shall produce their DWs on
             07.06.2016 on which date all of them shall be cross examined. If all
             the witnesses could not be cross examined on that day, the matter
             shall be continued till the next date i.e. on 08.06.2016 and on that
             date after the cross examination shall be closed and the case shall
             be fixed for argument. This application is allowed with further cost
             of Rs. 1000/-.”
8)        It would be pertinent to mention here that pursuant to the said order
dated 26.05.2017, passed by this Court, the petitioners herein had got
opportunity to produce their witnesses on 07.06.2016, on which date all of them
were to be cross examined and if all the witnesses could not be cross examined
on that date, the matter was to continue on 08.06.2017. As per the submissions
made by the learned Counsel for the petitioners, out of 11 listed witnesses, they
had examined 5 witnesses from their side.
CRP 337/2016                                                                  Page 3 of 12

9)          On 07.06.2016, the petitioners filed a petition 07.06.2016 with a
prayer to allow them to examine one more witness, namely, Sri ChandanSen in
addition to the left out witness. In the said petition, along with other reasons, a
cause was shown that the said witness had permanently shifted to Guwahati in
April, 2016 and the petitioners in spite of their best effort could only contact him
in the month of May, 2016 (no date or week mentioned) and he was an
important attesting witness, who had witnessed the execution of the agreement
for sale between the parties. It was stated therein that the defendants were not
in a position to contact the said witness. The said petition numbered as petition
No. 2540/16 dated 13.06.2017 was accompanied by the Evidence- on- affidavit
of the said witness.
10)         The learned Court below by its order dated 13.06.2016, rejected the
petition No. 2540/16 on the ground that in view of the order dated 26.05.2016
passed in CRP No. 153/06, whereby it has been made clear that after cross
examination of DWs on 08.08.2016, the suit will be posted for argument, so
there is no scope to entertain the petition No. 2540/16. As per report of the
Commissioner, appointed to record the cross examination of remaining DWs, the
DW No. 5 and 6 were cross examined. Hence, the suit was posted for argument
on 24.06.2016.
11)         The petitioners then preferred an application for review of the order
dated 13.06.2016. The respondents herein filed their written objection against
the review petition. Upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the learned
court below rejected the said application, amongst others, on the ground that
there was a specific order of this High Court that after closure of cross
examination of DWs the case will be fixed for argument.
12)         The learned counsel for the petitioners has made a painstaking
argument on the provisions of Order XVI Rule 1 and Order XVI Rule 1-A of the
Civil Procedure Code to press his point that even a unlisted witness can be
CRP 337/2016                                                                  Page 4 of 12

examined without the aid of summons issued by the Court. In this regard, he has
referred to the below mentioned case citations:-

             from CDJ 2010 Assam HC 285.
13)          It would be pertinent to mention that out of the above mentioned
citation list, the learned counsel for the petitioner had referred to the judgment
of KK Velusamy (supra), Rehman Hussain (supra), Rita Pandit (supra), Minor
Dipika (supra). But none of the other citations including list containing 94
judgments were either read or referred, nor it was mentioned for which point the
said cases were cited and, as such, it is best known to the learned counsel why
the remaining citations and list of 94 judgments were handed over in course of
argument.
14)          The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that in the
petition filed before the learned court below, the petitioners had quoted a wrong
provision of law. In this regard, he has submitted that a mere wring quotation of
CRP 337/2016                                                                 Page 5 of 12

law cannot prejudice him as the reading of the entire petition would show that
the purpose of filing the petition before the learned court below was to examine
an unlisted witness, which can be done under the provisions of Order XVI Rule 1
Sub-Rule 1(3) and also under Order XVI Rule 1-A CPC. In this connection, he has
placed reliance on the case of Mustt. Adiba Abu Bakkar (supra). It is also
submitted that as the petitioners had no knowledge of the availability of the said
witness prior to the order dated 25.06.2016 passed by this Court in CRP 153/16,
there could not be any infirmity if his name could not be mentioned in the list of
witness submitted by him.
15)        It is submitted with great force that the ultimate purpose of a court of
law is to arrive at a truth and in this journey, if one important witness is allowed
to be left out, it would cause travesty of justice and the petitioners would suffer
irreparable prejudice, as the said person was one of the attesting witness, whose
evidence was essential and vital to prove their Exhibit-1, in respect of which the
learned court below had permitted the petitioners to prove the same by adducing
secondary evidence.
16)        Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent supported the
impugned order and has referred to the inordinate delay in the disposal of the
suit. He has also pointed out that as per the statement made by the proposed
witness i.e. Chandan Sen in his evidence- on – affidavit had named the person
who was the writer of the alleged kutcha deed (Ext.1), he had also named the
four persons in the alleged presence before whom the parties to the said Ext.1
had signed. By referring to the same, it is submitted the petitioners/ defendants
had examined as many as 6 witnesses, they are now seeking to fill up the lacuna
in the evidence. It is also stated that it is not possible to believe the story
projected in the case because the list of witnesses was submitted on 15.05.2010
and the defendants had cross examined all the plaintiff’s witnesses thereafter,
and submitted the evidence of defendants’ witnesses on 20.09.2014 and during
all these years since the year 2010, the defendants never remembered the said
CRP 337/2016                                                                  Page 6 of 12

witness. Hence, the real intention is only to prolong the litigation and to fill-up
the lacuna which remained even after examining 6 witness. Hence, by referring
to the affidavit-in- opposition filed by the respondents, the learned counsel for
the respondent has prayed for dismissing this application.
17)         Having considered the rival arguments advanced by both the sides, I
have perused the materials on record. I am of the considered opinion that while
passing the order dated 26.05.2016 in CRP 153/16, this court had categorically
recorded that there was no jurisdictional error in the impugned order passed by
the learned court below. By the order dated 25.01.2016, the petitioners had lost
all opportunity to get any of their remaining witnesses cross examined. It was on
the concession made by the learned counsel for the respondent (as he was
then), that he was prepare to cross examine all the remaining DWs on a fixed
date that this Court had fixed the suit for cross examination of remaining DWs on
07.06.2016 and further provided that if for any reason the cross examination
gets spilled over then it would be done on 08.06.2016. It was also ordered that
on that date after the cross examination is closed, the suit would be fixed for
argument. This mandate leaves no doubt in my mind that the intention of the
said order was to allow cross examination of only remaining witness, that too on
the concession made by the learned counsel for the respondent.
18)         Therefore, I find that the learned court below had correctly interpreted
the order dated 26.05.2016 passed in CRP No. 153/16 and proceeded to close
the evidence of DWs and fix the suit for argument. It was rightly observed by the
learned court below that from the date of knowledge about the proposed
witness, till the cross of remaining 2 DWs had commenced on 07.06.2016, the
petitioners did not move the court. Though the petition was dated 07.06.2016,
the same was numbered and moved before the learned court below on
13.06.2016. On and from 08.06.2016, the learned court below could not have
got any power to admit fresh defendant’s witness, being bound by the order
CRP 337/2016                                                                  Page 7 of 12

passed by this Court in CRP 153/16 as it was mandated to fix the suit for
argument.
19)          There is no dispute that in appropriate cases, and on satisfaction of
the court that good grounds exists, the civil courts do have power to allow
examination of witnesses, whether listed or unlisted, at any stage of the suit, and
in appropriate cases, even in appeal under the powers conferred by the Civil
Procedure Code. Nonetheless, the cases cited by the learned counsel for the
petitioners do not help him because in the present case in hand, the
distinguishable feature is that owing to the order passed by this Court in CRP
153/16, this is not a case where the learned court below had any jurisdiction to
invoke the powers under Order XVI Rule 1 or Order XVI Rule 1-A to permit any
unlisted witness for the defendant’s side to be examined. The order dated
26.05.2016 passed by this Court in CRP No. 153/16 had attained finality and, as
such, the subordinate court had to follow the said order both in letter and in
spirit. Hence, this court does not find any infirmity in both the impugned orders
dated 13.06.2016 and 26.08.2016 passed by the learned court below.
20)          Visiting the contents of this present application as well as the two
petitions filed by the petitioners once again, the argument advanced by the
learned counsel for the respondent is found to be of great substance. The
learned counsel for the respondent had submitted that in the evidence- on-
affidavit filed by the proposed witness, Chandan Sen had referred to four persons
in whose presence the agreement at Exhibit-1 was signed and also named the
writer of the said instrument. However, out of these 5 names as provided, from
the chart given in paragraph 15 of this present application, four persons in whose
presence the writing at Exhibit-1 was signed are named witnesses in the list of
11 witnesses submitted by the petitioners. Hence, after the respondent has
examined one of themselves and other four witnesses to the execution of the
writing, the only conclusion which can be reached is that the petitioners are
trying to fill-up their lacuna, which cannot be the reason for the courts to permit
CRP 337/2016                                                                 Page 8 of 12

examination of any witness at a belated stage. This is one more reason why this
court is not inclined to interfere with the otherwise well reasoned order of the
learned court below.
21)         On perusal of the voluminous application, this court does not find any
document to prima facie show that the proposed witness ChandanSen was
residing elsewhere for considerable time, or that he was ill, for which he returned
back. On the contrary it is his own statement that he was a permanent resident
of Guwahati. Hence, the genuineness of the plea of the said person not been
found is not believable. Moreover, viewed from another angle, it is the
requirement under Order XVI Rule 1 CPC that not later than fifteen days after the
date on which the issues are settled, the parties are obliged to furnish a list of
witnesses whom the propose to call and, as such, there was no need for the
petitioner to withheld the name from the list of witness merely because his
address was allegedly not known, which again is not believable because the
specifically admitted case of the petitioners and his proposed witness is that the
respondents No.1, 3 and 6 herein, namely, Ashok Prasad, Gautam and Sita
Prasad had visited his residence at Lalganesh but could not meet him. Therefore,
it cannot be accepted that the petitioners did not know the whereabouts of the
said witness, which is belied by their own specific admission.
22)         Moreover, as per the statement made in paragraph 25 the evidence-
on- affidavit of Sri Chandan Sen, the petitioners approached him in second week
of May, 2017 with a request to appear in the case as a witness. Paragraph 25
reads as follows – “That when I was residing in Guwahati regularly during that
period, I did not have knowledge as to the subsequent development. It was only
in the 2nd week of May, 2016 the defendant No.2 Ashok Prasad and his brother
Gautam and widow mother Sita Prasad met me in my residence at Lalganesh and
reported about the case with a further request to appear the court and give
evidence as being their witness…”A similar statement also appears in paragraph
11 of the review petition referred above, the relevant portion of the said
CRP 337/2016                                                                 Page 9 of 12

paragraph is as follows – “… In the second week of May, 2016 the petitioners
Ashok Prasad, Gautom Prasad and Silla Prasad went to his residence at
Lalganesh and informed him about the present suit which is not pending before
this Hon’ble Court.”However, in a contrast, in second sub-paragraph after
paragraph 39 (pp.38) of the present application, the following statement is made
– “… Later on, after disposal of the aforesaid Revision Petition by the Hon’ble
High Court by order dated 26.05.2016, the petitioners could come to know that
the said unlisted witness returned back to Guwahati permanently and it was only
because of that reason beyond reach, they were not in a position to bring on
record the said facts and seek leave before the Hon’ble High Court by making
any statements in the aforesaid revision petition.” Further, in first sub-paragraph
after paragraph 42, it is one again stated that “… The petitioners in that regard,
also stated in their application that they came to know about the permanent
shifting of the said unlisted witness after the disposal of the aforesaid CRP No.
153/2016 by the Hon’ble High Court vide order dated 26.05.2016, they were
hardly in a position to bring on record the said fact and to appraise the Hon’ble
High Court at the time of Motion hearing of the said CRP No. 153/2016, nor did
they have any occasion to make any statement or averment in the said Revision
Petition.”
23)         Thus, from above quoted excerpts it is seen that while in the
evidence-on- affidavit of Chandan Sen and Revision Petition filed by the
petitioners, there is a clear admission that the petitioners had approached the
said Chandan Sen in second week of May, 2016 to apprise him of the suit with a
request to appear as a witness. Hence, on 26.05.2016, when CRP NO. 153/2016
was being heard, the petitioners did have knowledge about their proposed
witness. But now in this present application, the petitioners has made a different
story-line that they became aware of their proposed witness after the passing of
the order in CRP No. 153/2016. Therefore, of the two versions projected by the
petitioners, as extracted above, one has to be a false statement. The copy of
plaint as annexed with the present application is not supported by any affidavit,
CRP 337/2016                                                                Page 10 of 12

which is mandatory under the amended Civil Procedure Code. Interestingly, in
Annexure-T, which is the copy of order dated 13.06.2016, in the typed copy of
the said order, one part of the order appearing in the hand-written copy is
missing, which was otherwise relevant because it contains the operative part of
the order by which the suit was fixed for argument on 24.06.2016, which is
omitted in the typed copy thereof. Again, in the copy of the review petition
annexed to this application as Annexure-U, there is no affidavit or verification
appended to the said petition and, as such, it is not known as to who had signed
the verification or affidavit. Thus, the inevitable conclusion of this court is that
there has been a deliberate and willful attempt to mislead this Court by making
false and/or mutually contradictory statements as quoted above. Going by the
statements available in this application as quoted above, the petitioners were
well aware of the existence of Chandan Sen, but yet allowed this Court to pass
orders to permit cross examination of the remaining DWs, under the
circumstances, this Court would definitely be referring to DWs on record as on
26.05.2016 and no one else. Therefore, the petitioners cannot be now permitted
to examine any further witnesses on any ground whatsoever. One who comes
with unclean hands has no entitlement to justice when it was their intention to
deceive this Court with incorrect statement that they became aware of the said
witness after 26.05.2016, whereas, the petitioners and the said witness
themselves claim to have met in second week of May, 2016. The attempt to
mislead this court with false statement is strongly deprecated.
24)        It is a trite law that the jurisdiction under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India is also an equitable jurisdiction. Therefore, when the
petitioners are not found to have approached this Court with clean hands, rather,
when attempt has been made to mislead this Court with incorrect statements
about the time when the petitioners got knowledge of their proposed witness,
Chandan Sen, the petitioners have lost their right to any equitable relief from this
Court.
CRP 337/2016                                                                 Page 11 of 12

25)         For the reasons as indicated above, this court does not find any
infirmity in the impugned orders passed by the learned court below. The order
dated 13.06.2016 and 26.08.2016, passed by the learned Court of Civil Judge
No.3, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati, are both upheld. The petitioners are not
found to be entitled to any relief. Hence, this revision stands dismissed.
26)         For making a deliberate and willful attempt to mislead this court with
contradictory statements as quoted above, a case for prosecution for perjury can
also be initiated, however, in the present case in hand, ends of justice would be
met if an exemplary cost of Rs.3,000/- is imposed on the petitioners, making
payment of such cost a condition precedent to further prosecute the suit. On
such cost being deposited, the same may be made over to the District Legal
Services Authority, Guwahati. Moreover, a further cost of Rs.2,000/- is imposed
for causing delay in the disposal of the suit under section 35-B of the Civil
Procedure Code, which shall be also a condition precedent to further prosecute
the suit and this is to be deposited in favour of the respondent herein before the
