                                 W.A. No. 285 of 2014
                   Baishnab Charan Rout       ……………            Appellant.
                                               Vs.
                   Union of India & five Ors. ….………..        Respondents.
02. 04.09.2014            Having unsuccessfully pleaded in W.P.(C) No.
               12227 of 2014 for judicial intervention to have his
               (appellant) date of birth altered from 02.10.1954 to
               05.10.1958, in his service record, the appellant/writ
               petitioner    is  in   appeal    against  the   order   dated
               24.07.2014 passed in the above proceeding.
               2.         We have heard Mr. P.C. Sethi, learned counsel
               for the appellant/writ petitioner.
               3.         The facts necessary to be noticed are that the
               appellant/writ petitioner is an employee of the Paradip
               Port Trust (for short, hereinafter referred to as “the
               Trust”) since 15.12.1978 and presently working as Ferro
               Printer in the establishment of the Executive Engineer,
               Design Cell of the Trust. At the time of entering into the
               service, his date of birth, on the basis of School Leaving
               Certificate (SLC) produced by him was entered as
               2.10.1954.      He, having come to learn that his date of
               birth though 5.10.1958 had been wrongly entered as
               2.10.1954, applied for         a  duplicate SLC    from    the
               respondent No.5 herein, which, on being obtained,

                     -2-
disclosed his date of birth to be 05.10.1958.          After
obtaining the said duplicate certificate, he on 24.07.2013
submitted a representation with the Trust for correction
of his date of birth from 02.10.1954 to 05.10.1958 on
the basis of the duplicate SLC. His prayer having been
rejected on 28.10.2013, he approached this Court for
redressal of his grievance. By the impugned order dated
24.07.2014, the writ petition was disposed of by the
learned   Single   Judge     relegating  the  appellant/writ
petitioner to the appropriate forum as the issue involved
disputed questions of facts.
4.        Mr. Sethi has emphatically argued that it being
apparent    on   the     face   of   the  record  that  the
appellant/writ petitioner’s age had been wrongly entered
in his service book to be 02.10.1954, the learned Single
Judge ought not to have summarily rejected the writ
petition. He has urged that in the face of the duplicate
School Leaving Certificate, the appellant/writ petitioner’s
date of birth ought to have been directed to be conceded
as 5.10.1958.      In support of his plea, Mr. Sethi has
placed reliance on the decision of the Hon’ble apex Court

                     -3-
in the case of R.K. Jangra Vs. State of Punjab & Ors.,
(2009) 5 SCC 703.
5.         Upon hearing the learned counsel for the
appellant and on a consideration of the materials on
record, more particularly the photo copy extract from the
service book of the appellant/writ petitioner produced by
him,    we   are  of   the  unhesitant    opinion    that   no
interference in the instant appeal is called for.         It is
apparent from the service record of the appellant/writ
petitioner that on the date of entry in service i.e. on
15.12.1978, his date of birth was recorded to be
“2.10.1954 Second October Nineteen Hundred Fifty
Four, as verified from S.L.C.” produced by him at that
point of time.   This page of the service book, containing
inter alia the said entry as well as other particulars of
the    appellant/writ    petitioner,  also    contained     his
signature in affirmation of the correctness of the entries
therein.    There is thus no element of doubt that the
appellant/writ     petitioner’s    date    of    birth     was
recorded/entered in his service book , in his presence, to
be 02.10.1954 on the basis of the SLC produced by him.

                     -4-
6.         It is the pleaded case of the appellant/writ
petitioner that in the year 2013, he obtained a duplicate
copy of SLC and on the basis thereof, he applied for
alteration of the date of birth from 02.10.1954 to
05.10.1958. Apparently thus for 35 years, prior to his
said request, there was no initiative on his part to alter
his date of birth.     His pleaded averments also do not
convincingly explain about the time lap and lack of steps
on his part to ensure such correction.
7.         It is a well settled preposition of law that any
request for alteration of date of birth by any incumbent
in service, if highly belated and made at the fag end of
one’s career, ought not be entertained.
8.         We find no persuasive reason to take a view
different from the one adopted by the Trust in relation to
the request of the appellant/writ petitioner to correct his
date of birth. In course of arguments, learned counsel
for the appellant/writ petitioner did not dispute his
signature in the page of the service book in which his
date of birth was entered as 2.10.1954, as verified with
reference to the SLC produced by him.           To reiterate,
there is no cogent explanation for this, otherwise,

                            -5-
        inexplicable delay on his part to get his date of birth
        altered. Further, the decision of the Hon’ble apex Court
        in R.K. Jangra (supra) is distinguishable on facts as the
        appellant therein had applied for correction of his date of
        birth within two years of joining the service.    The said
        decision   is  therefore   of   no   assistance    to  the
        appellant/writ petitioner.
        9.        On a cumulative consideration of all aspects,
        we are thus of the unhesitant view that no interference
        with the impugned order is warranted.
                  The appeal lacks merit and is dismissed.
