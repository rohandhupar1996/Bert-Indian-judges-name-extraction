    Education, Guwahati; now known as the Institution of Advance Studies in
    Education. Initially the State Government in the Education (Personnel) Department

    taking over of charge or till regularization of her service by APSC, whichever is
    earlier. She accepted her said appointment, joined her service in said college as a
    Lecturer, which was extended from time to time.

    WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                Page 1 of 10

4.      The APSC, on 03.08.1998, published the result of said selection of
candidates for the post of Lecturers in Government B.T. & Provincialised Colleges in
the State under the Higher Education Department and in the said Select List the
petitioner was recommended at merit position No. 2 for the three posts of lecturers
in Physical Science and, on the basis of the same, the State Government in the
Education (Elementary) Department vide Notification dated 21.06.1999 regularised
the services of the petitioner with effect from 03.08.1998, the date on which the
APSC published the select list, observing that the inter-se-seniority will be
determined as per the recommendation of the APSC.
5.      In the meanwhile, before the aforesaid of publication of result by the APSC,
the State Government in the Education (Higher) Department vide Notification dated
07.03.1996, regularized the services of the Respondents No. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9
others, who were serving as Lecturers of B.T. Colleges in the State under
Regulation 3(f) of the APSC.
6.      On 07.05.2003, the State Government in the Elementary Education
department published a draft gradation list of the Lecturers of Government and
Provincialised B.Ed. Colleges of the State as on 01.04.2003, informing all
concerned, inviting objections from the incumbents concerned on the said seniority
list that observing that the aggrieved may file his/her objection if any to be
submitted within 15 days from the date of issuance of the said list.
7.      The petitioner submitted objection regarding fixation of her seniority in the
said draft gradation list of lecturers in Government and Provincialised B.Ed. Colleges
of the State stating that she is senior to the candidates including the present
respondent Nos. 8 to 12 who were appointed only on 27.02.1998, whereas as per
the Government Notification dated 07.06.1989 she has been continuously serving
since 1989 working under Regulations 3(i) and 3(f) of APSC for the period of 1991
till 1998, appeared in the interview before the APSC on 28.02.1995 and was
selected by the APSC, result of which was declared by APSC on 03.08.1998.
However, without any change, the respondents in the State Government in the
Education Department published the Final Gradation List on 10.01.2000 in which,
the petitioner was placed at Seniority Position No. 20, maintaining the seniority
positions of the private respondent Nos. 4 to 17 above the petitioners, though from
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                  Page 2 of 10

the said gradation list dated 10.01.2000, it clearly reflects that the respondent Nos.
8 to 17 all joined in the service as lecturers in Government & Provincialised B.T.
Colleges of the State in February 1998, May 1994, October, 1992, July, 1999 and
October 1999 respectively, whereas the petitioner joined her service 19.06.1989.
8.       Claiming that her seniority has not been considered, the petitioner preferred
a writ petition before this Hon’ble Court, being W.P.(C) No. 2079 of 2004 and the
Court after hearing the parties, by order dated 05.05.2004 disposed of the same,
directing the Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam in the
Education Department to dispose of the representation of the petitioner dated
17.05.2003 and 20.05.2003 in accordance of law, within a period of one month,
from the date of furnishing the certified copy of the said order before him, along
with the copy of the writ petition and its enclosures and further directed the
respondents therein that for the limited period of said one month, no action in
furtherance of the impugned gradation list shall be taken.
9.       In pursuance of the said order dated 05.05.2004 passed in W.P.(C) No.
2079/2004 the State Government in the Elementary Education Department by order
dated 20.09.2004 disposed of the said representation of the petitioner dated
17.5.2003 with a speaking order that –
         “the petitioner’s seniority was fixed from the date of announcement of the
         APSC’s result along with other similarly situated persons as per the
         provisions of Rule 23 of the Assam Public Service Rules, 1982 which do not
         permit the regularisation of service covering the period under Regulation 3(f)
         of APSC and that there is no scope to review the petitioner’s prayer for her
         seniority at that stage.”
10.      Though the State Government in the Elementary Education Department by
an order dated 23.02.2012 subsequently allowed the petitioner to hold the charge
of the Principal of Government Banikanta College of Teacher Education at Guwahati
w.e.f. 01.02.2012 that was extended from time to time, but the said Department by
its notification dated 02.05.2013 promoted the respondent Nos. 4 to 15, Lecturers
of Government & Provincialised B.Ed. and B.T. Colleges of the State to the posts of
Professors in Government & Provincialised B.Ed. and B.T. Colleges on officiating
capacity for a period of one year under Regulation 4(b) of the APSC (Limitation of
Functions) Regulation, 1951 w.e.f. the date of taking over their charge and posted
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                    Page 3 of 10

them at respective Government & Provincialised B.Ed. and B.T. Colleges shown
against their names.
11.      Being aggrieved with such promotions of the said respondent Nos. 4 to 15
to the post of Professors on officiating capacity disregarding her claim, the
petitioner has preferred this writ petition for quashing the said notification dated
02.05.2013 promoting the private respondent Nos. 4 to 15 to the post of Professors
in Government & Provincialised B.Ed. & B.T. Colleges of the State and also prayed
to recast the final gradation list of Lecturers in the Government & Provincialised
B.Ed. & B.T. Colleges of the State from Serial No. 1 to 20 by considering their
seniority on the basis of their initial date of joining in service and with a further
prayer to direct the respondents to promote her to the post of Professor in
Government & Provincialised Colleges of Teacher Education including the said
institutions of Advanced Studies in Education as per the recast gradation list and
accordingly, to make further promotions to the post of Principals in such
institutions.
12.      The petitioner contended that though she joined her service as lecturer in a
Government B.T. College on 19.06.1989, but because of different methods and
different dates of regularisation, i.e. 07.03.2006, 27.02.1998, 03.08.1998 and
25.03.2003 (Cabinet Decision), four different groups of lectures of Government &
Provincialised Colleges of Teacher Education in the State, who are juniors to her in
service, joined later than her, have become seniors to her.
13.      She further submitted that though she appeared in the interview before
APSC on 28.02.1995 for regularization her service, but the APSC declared the result
of said interview only on 03.08.1998, more than after three years and due to no
fault of her she cannot lose her seniority. The petitioner further contended that
without waiting for the regularization of services of 13 such lecturers of
Government & Provincialised B.Ed. Colleges of the State, by the APSC who were
appointed under Regulation 3(f) of the APSC (L of F) Rules, the State Government
by the notification dated 07.03.1996 regularized such lecturers including the private
Respondents No.4 to 7 but without following the same procedure with regard to
the petitioner. The petitioner, in addition to that, contended that the State
Government w.e.f. 27.02.1998 provincialised the Mangaldai College of Teacher
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                 Page 4 of 10

Education as well as Tezpur College of Teacher Education and, accordingly,
provincialized the services of the respondents No.8 to 12 serving in the said two
colleges w.e.f. 27.02.1998 and only after exercise of those two process of
regularization by the State Government, The state respondents         carried out the
process of provincialization of such lecturers working in Government/Provincialised
Colleges of Teachers Education through APSC and the APSC by its result dated
3.8.1998 also regularized the services of the Respondent Nos.7, 9, 13, 14, 16 and
17 out of which the services of Respondent nos. 9 was already provincialised by
provincialization order dated 27.02.1999. But, in the seniority list the seniority of
the respondent Nos. 8 to 15 were considered on the date of provincialization of
their services and not from the date of regularization of services by the ASPC and
all these affected the seniority position of the petitioner though she joined her
service as lecturer in the Government College Teacher of Education almost nine
years prior to them. The petitioner submitted that if the inter-se-seniority of the
lecturer of such Government/Provincialised Colleges of Teachers Education was
considered on the basis of length of continuous service, she would have been at
second position of the gradation list of seniority of lecturers of such College
Teachers of Education. According to the petitioner, she has been deprived not only
from her seniority position, but also from the promotion to the post of professors
though she is having the qualification of M.Sc. in Physics with a Degree of Master of
Education and Ph.D. in education and belongs to reserved community of OBC.
14.     The respondent Nos. 4 and 5 submitted that though in pursuance of the
notification dated 28.06.1984, of the State Government in the Education
Department, they have been serving as Lecturers in Kokrajhar College of Teacher
Education under w.e.f. 03.07.1984 and 13.09.1984 respectively under Regulation
3(f) of the APSC (Limitation of Functions) Regulation, 1951, but they along with five
others in a Writ petition being Civil Rule No. 2020/1994 approached this Court for a
direction to the official respondents therein     to regularise their service and on
finding that they were appointed under Regulation 3(f) of the ASPC (L&F)
Regulation, 1951, whose appointments were extended from time to time and are
serving for about 10 years in various B.T. Colleges of the State, the Court by order
dated 18.05.1995 passed in said C.R. No. 2020/1994 directed the State
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                  Page 5 of 10

Government to take steps for regularization of the services of the petitioners of the
said writ petition, including the Respondent Nos. 4 and 5, without referring their
cases to the APSC and to pass necessary orders of regularization. It is seen that
pursuant to said order dated 18.05.1995 passed in Civil Rule No. 2020/1994, the
State Government by notification dated 07.03.1996 regularized the services of the
writ petitioner of said matter including respondent Nos. 4 and 5.
15.      The Respondent Nos. 8 to 13 and 17 as well as the Respondent No. 14
contended that it is a fact that the petitioner was initially appointed under
Regulation 3(i) and subsequently under Regulation 3(f) of APSC (Ad-hoc)
Appointment Rules, 1986 and was finally regularized by the State Government on
the basis of selection made by the APSC on 03.08.1998 and, in the meanwhile, two
batches of lecturers of Government and Provincialised B.T & B.Ed. Colleges of the
State were regularized by the State Government vide notification dated 07.03.1996
as well as provincialised their services w.e.f. 27.02.1998. The said Respondents
also contended that the final gradation list of the lecturers of Government and
Provincialised B.T. & B.Ed. Colleges of the State on 01.04.2003 was already
assailed by the petitioner in her writ petition before this Court in W.P.(C) No.
2079/2004, in which she made prayer for quashing of the said gradation list and
that the Court after considering the matter, directed the Commissioner and
Secretary to the Government of Assam in the Education Department to dispose of
the representation of the petitioner with regard to the said final gradation list as on
01.04.2003, pursuant to which the State Government in the Elementary Education
Department by a speaking order dated 20.09.2004 disposed of the petitioner’s
representation dated 17.05.2003 clarifying that the provisions of Rule 23 of the
Assam Public Service Rules, 1982 do not permit regularization of service covering
the period under Regulation 3(f) of APSC and that there is no scope to review the
petitioner’s prayer for her seniority in the said final seniority list and that as the said
order has now attained finality, not being challenged by the petitioner, now at such
a belated stage, after nine years, she cannot unsettle the seniority position of the
respondents by filing this writ petition, since the same cannot be re-opened for
judicial scrutiny in the present proceeding as the same is barred by the principles of
resjudicata. The said respondents further submitted that they are senior to the
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                       Page 6 of 10

petitioner and the State Respondents have promoted them to the posts of
Professors.
16.      The petitioner also filed her replies to the affidavits of the respondents as
well as an additional affidavit in this wit petition and relied upon the judgment of
this Court passed on 6.6.2014 in W.P.(C) No.2913 of 2012, wherein this Hon’ble
Court considered the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Direct
Recruit Class-II Engineering Officers’ Association -Vs- State of Maharashtra reported
in (1990) 2 SCC 715 as well as State of West Bengal -Vs- Aghori Nath Dey reported
in (1993) 3 SCC 371 wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that to enable
seniority to be counted from the date of initial appointment and not according to
the date of confirmation, the incumbent of the post has to be initially appointed
according to the Rules and that when the initial appointment is only on ad-hoc and
not according to rules and made as a stop gap arrangement, the service on such
officiating basis in said post cannot be taken into account for considering the
seniority.
17.      It is seen that the State Government in the Education (Personnel)
Department by notification No. EPG.726/87/Pt/9 dated 07.06.1989 subject to
discharge without any notice and without assigning any reasons thereof, the
petitioner and six others were appointed temporarily and until further orders a
Lecturer of B.T. Colleges for one year w.e.f. the date of taking over charge or till
regularisation by APSC, whichever is earlier, under Regulation 3(1) of the APSC
(Adhoc) Appointment Rules, 1986 in the specified scale of pay and allowances as
admissible under the Rules and was posted against the post of Physical Science at
the erstwhile Banikanta College of Teacher’s Education, Guwahati, which the
petitioner accepted and joined her service in the said capacity on 19.06.1989 which
was extended from time to time.
18. It is also seen that after the said Assam Public Service Commission (Adhoc)
Appointment Rules, 1986 was repealed by the State Government by its notification
dated 04.11.1991, by another notification No. B(2)H.259/92/128 dated 21.09.1992
the State Government in the Education (Personnel) Department appointed the
petitioner as Lecturer in Physical Science at said Banikanta College of Teacher’s
Education, Guwahati, under Regulation 3(f) of the APSC (Limitation of Functions)
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                    Page 7 of 10

Regulations, 1951 for a period of 4 (four) months with effect from 04.11.1991 in
the specified scale of pay and allowances as admissible under the Rule, under
Notification No. and Date of original appointment No. EPG.725/27/Pt/123 dated
24.12.1991, which was extended from time to time till her service in the said post
of Lecturer in Physical Science in the said Banikanta College of Teacher’s Education,
Guwahati was regularised by APSC on 03.08.1998 in terms of an interview held on
28.02.1995, conducted by the APSC.
19.     The petitioner accepted her both appointments, (i) dated 07.06.1989 under
Regulation 3(1) of the APSC (Adhoc) Appointment Rules, 1986 and the other (ii)
dated 21.09.1992 under Regulation 3(f) of the APSC (Limitation of Functions)
Regulations, 1951, which was issued after repealing the said 1986 Rules.
20.     The Assam Public Service Commission (Adhoc) Appointment Rules, 1986
came into force w.e.f. 07.05.1986, the date when it was published in the State
Gazette and it was framed to regulate the ad-hoc appointment in public services
under the Government of Assam and Regulation 3(1) of said APSC (Adhoc)
Appointment Rules, 1986 provided for Ad-hoc appointment, which read as :
        “3. Ad-hoc appointment – (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any
        Service Rules, ad-hoc appointment by direct recruitment to a temporary post
        created under the Government may be made, if it is necessary in public interest
        that the appointment should be made immediately and reference              to the
        Commission (APSC) would cause undue delay:
                Provided that if the post has been sanctioned for or is likely to last for
        more than four months, the Commission shall, as possible , be consulted for
        making the appointment on regular basis, as provided for in Clause (c) of sub-
        rule (2) of the said Rule (1986 Rules).”
21.     The Assam Public Service Commission (Limitation of Functions) Regulations,
1951 is a regulation specifying the matters in which it shall not be necessary to
consult the Public Service Commission and Clause 3 (f) of said 1951 Regulation
provides that –
        “3. It shall not be necessary for the Commission to be consulted in matters
        relating to methods of recruitment to civil services and post or the suitability of
        the candidates for such appointments, in the following cases, namely –
        (a) …………………………..
        (b) …………………………..
        (c)   …………………………..
        (d) …………………………..
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                     Page 8 of 10

         (e)    …………………………..
         (f) when an appointment is to be made by direct recruitment to a temporary
         post created in a service if it is necessary in the public interest that the
         appointment should be made immediately and reference to the Commission
         would cause undue delay; provided that if the post has been sanctioned for, or is
         likely to last for more than four months, the Commission shall as soon as
         possible, be consulted in all matters mentioned in sub-clause (3) of Article 320 of
         the Constitution.
22.      In the case of Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers’ Assn. -Vs- State of
Maharashtra, reported in (1990) 2 SCC 715 placed by the petitioner in her support,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court have held –
         “We were taken through the judgment by the learned counsel for the parties
         more than once and we are in complete agreement with the ratio decidendi, that
         the period of continuous officiation by a government servant, after his
         appointment by following the rules applicable for substantive appointments, has
         to be taken into account for determining his seniority; and seniority cannot be
         determined on the sole test of confirmation, for, as was pointed out, confirmation
         is one of the inglorious uncertainties of government service depending neither on
         efficiency of the incumbent nor on the availability of substantive vacancies. The
         principle for deciding inter se seniority has to conform to the principles of equality
         spelt out by Articles 14 and 16. If an appointment is made by way of stop-gap
         arrangement, without considering the claims of all the eligible available persons
         and without following the rules of appointment, the experience on such
         appointment cannot be equated with the experience of a regular appointee,
         because of the qualitative difference in the appointment. To equate the two
         would be to treat two unequals as equal which would violate the equality clause.
         But if the appointment is made after considering the claims of all eligible
         candidates and the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the
         regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules made for regular
         substantive appointments, there is no reason to exclude the officiating service for
         purpose of seniority. Same will be the position if the initial appointment itself is
         made in accordance with the rules applicable to substantive appointments as in
         the present case. To hold otherwise will be discriminatory and arbitrary.”
         “Where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and
         made as a stop-gap arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken
         into account for considering the seniority.”
23.      In the present case, it is noticed that the petitioner did not challenge the
speaking order dated 20.09.2004 passed by the State Government in the Education
(Elementary) Department pursuant to the order dated 05.05.2004 passed by this
Court in W.P.(C) No. 2079/2004, wherein the State Government explained its
inability to review her seniority position in the final gradation list of lecturers of
Government and Provincialised Teachers Training (B.Ed.) Colleges of the State as
on 01.04.2003 observing that the period under Regulation 3(f) of the APSC (L of F)
WP(C) No. 3177 of 2013                                                         Page 9 of 10

Regulations, 1951 is not covered for the purpose of seniority and by efflux of time
said order dated 20.09.2004 has attained finality, as the petitioner did not
challenge the same before any Court of law, except filing of this writ petition on
30.05.2013. As such the Court is of the view that it cannot exercise its power
under the writ jurisdiction at a distant time after more than 8 (eight) years 8 (eight)
months to determine the seniority of the petitioner above the respondents so as to
unsettle a settled thing.
24.     Further, the seniority position of the Respondent Nos. 4 and 5 were
determined as the State Government by notification dated 07.03.1996 regularized
their services in terms of an order dated 18.05.1995 passed by the Court in Civil
Rule No. 2020/1994, where the Court considering their long tenure of service under
Regulation 3(f) of the APSC (L of F) Regulations, 1951, directed the State
Government to regularise their service without the consideration to be made by the
APSC.
25.     Moreover, with regard to other private respondents, when the colleges they
were serving, were brought under provincialization by the State Government w.e.f.
27.02.1998, therefore, their services were also brought under provincialisation from
the same date i.e. from 27.02.1998 itself.
26.     Furthermore, vide notification dated 02.05.2013, the private respondent
Nos. 4 to 15 were promoted to the posts of Professors under Regulation 4(d) of the
APSC (L of F) Regulations, 1951 on officiating basis against vacant posts only on
the basis of their seniority above the petitioner as Lecturers, who are senior to the
petitioner.
27.     For the reasons above, this writ petition being devoid of merit, stands
dismissed.
