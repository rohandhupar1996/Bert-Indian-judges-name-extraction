CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE YOGESH KHANNA
YOGESH KHANNA, J.
1.     This appeal is preferred by the appellant/defendant against the
judgment and decree dated 16.08.2019 passed by the learned Additional
District Judge-06/South-East District, Saket Courts, New Delhi
(hereinafter referred as the learned ‘Trial Court’) in CS No.10039/2016
whereby the suit of the respondent/plaintiff filed under Order XXXVII
CPC for recovery of Rs.85.00 lac was decreed for Rs.74.00 lac on failure
of the appellant to deposit the amount in learned Trial Court as ordered
while allowing the leave to defend application of appellant.
2.     The brief facts are:- a)the respondent filed summary suit for money
recovery under Order XXXVII CPC on the ground the appellant and his
son Pankaj Thapar (who generally resides in United Kingdom) had
        RFA No.965/2019                                             Page 1 of 6

approached the respondent and represented the appellant was running an
export business of Indian garments under the name and style of M/s.AAA
Overseas Handicrafts/AAA Handicrafts Overseas – a proprietorship firm
which exports garments to Pankaj Thapar at England, who retail such
garments in England;
b)     the appellant since was in financial need had requested the
respondent to invest in such export business in return of some benefits.
Both the father and son posed a rosy picture of their entire business and
hence the respondent invested a sum of Rs.30.00 lac in the manner as
given in para No.5 of plaint;
c)     the appellant did not repay the amount as also the profits and when
threatened to lodge legal action, at the behest of the appellant, his son
Kapil Thapar issued a demand promissory note in the sum of Rs.30.00
lac in favour of the respondent. Upon execution of such documents in
December 2004 and January 2005, the appellant and her son again
represented the respondent to invest some more amount in the business
and on their inducement the respondent invested Rs.44.00 lac with effect
from January 2005 till February 2006 in the manner as alleged in para
No.11 of the plaint;
d)     after the receipt of the amount of Rs.74.00 lac        in total, the
appellant started avoiding the respondent and after great persuasion the
appellant had issued two cheques – dated 21.03.2005 and 25.05.2005
both for Rs.25.00 lac each both drawn on Punjab National Bank, Nehru
Place, New Delhi as well as New Custom House, IGI Airport, New Delhi
from the account of his firm as AAA Overseas Handicrafts;
        RFA No.965/2019                                          Page 2 of 6

e)     both the cheques were dishonoured on presentation; thus a legal
notice dated 21.10.2005 was issued , which was ignored and hence this
suit under Order XXXVII CPC was filed on the basis of such cheques.
3.     An application for leave to defend was filed by the appellant
wherein the appellant alleged the respondent had given surety for the
appellant for some bank loan transaction and had given title deeds of his
house and when the appellant could not repay the loan, the respondent
paid Rs.10.00 lac to the bank to clear the loan of the appellant and got
signed from him various documents, including subject cheques etc,
which the respondent has now misused.
4.     The parties settled their disputes before Delhi Mediation Centre,
Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi vide a settlement agreement dated 30.09.2009
wherein both the parties had agreed as follows:-
               “1. That the parties shall appear in the Court of Sh.D.K.Malhotra,
               ld.ADJ, Delhi on 31.10.2009 where a Suit for Specific Performance is
               pending. They shall make a request to the Court for adjourning the
               matter to 05.11.2009 on which date Ms.Neha Thapar, Sh.Rajiv Thapar
               and Sh.S.S.Thapar shall pay an amount of Rs.Five lacs by way of a
               bank draft to Smt.Bimla Devi Verma w/o Sh.L.R.Verma. On receipt of
               the aforesaid amount of Rs.Five Lac, Smt.Bimla Devi Verma shall
               withdraw her Suit for Specific Performance filed against Sh.S.S.Thapar
               on 05.11.2009 itself.
               2. That the balance amount of Rs.Thirty Eight Lacs shall be paid by
               Ms.Neha Thapar, Rajiv Thapar and S S Thapar to Smt.Bimla Devi
               Verma in 12 equal monthly installments. First such installment shall be
               paid on or before 05.12.2009. Each subsequent installment shall be
               paid on or before 5th day of each subsequent month. Money on account
               of all these installment shall be deposited by them in the bank account
               of Smt.Bimla Devi Verma bearing No.55007220294, State Bank of
               Patiala, Kalkaji Branch, New Delhi.”
5.     Admittedly, Rs.7.00 lac only was paid by the appellant to the
respondent, hence conditional leave to defend was granted by the learned
Trial Court to the appellant to contest this suit on his depositing an
        RFA No.965/2019                                                              Page 3 of 6

amount of Rs.34.00 lac. The relevant portion of the order dated
28.03.2019 of the learned Trial Court is as under:-
              "5. It is important to note that there was settlement between the parties
              in respect of this case in complaint cases filed by plaintiff. The said
              settlement was in the Mediation Center in Tis Hazari Court on
              30.09.2009 fully and finally for the sum of Rs. 43 lacs. The said
              settlement was in respect of various cases and the present suit was to
              be withdrawn on its next date of hearing. The said settlement also
              recorded that in case of two consecutive defaults in the payment of
              Rs.43 lacs the whole agreement was to become null and void. Rs. 5 lacs
              was to be paid on 05.11.2009 and balance of Rs. 38 lacs was to be paid
              in twelve monthly installments starting from on or before 05.12,2009. It
              is admitted case that said payment was not paid in full and only sum of
              Rs. 7 lacs was paid which though initially was denied by the plaintiff in
              the suit but was subsequently admitted as appears from the order sheet
              dated 24.07.2014 and 08.09.2014.
              6. Keeping in view the aforesaid material contention raised as to the
              limitation, issuance of cheque of Rs.. 74 lacs from the account of AAA
              Handcrafts Overseas as detailed above, issue as to the liability upto
              extent of Rs. 74 lacs i.e. pertaining to the cheque amount arises which
              requires trial but keeping in view payment of Rs. 41 lacs by way of
              alleged cheque by plaintiff to the defendant, I deem it proper to seek
              deposit of a sum of Rs. 34 lacs by way of FDR on record as Rs. 7 lacs
              stands paid admittedly after the aforesaid mediation settlement.
              Defendant is accordingly granted conditional leave to defend the suit
              subject to deposit of sum of Rs. 34 lacs by way of FDR within four
              weeks with advance dopy of the written statement to the opposite
              counsel. Application for leave to defend stands allowed accordingly.”
6.    The appellant challenged the order dated 28.03.2019 in Civil
Miscellaneous (Main) No.880/2019 before this Court but such petition
was also dismissed by this Court vide an order dated 28.05.2019 which
read as under:-
              "6. On the facts of the present case, the payment of ₹ 41 lakhs, by the
              respondent to the petitioner, was by cheque. The settlement of disputes
              between the parties on 30.09.2009 also contemplated payment of the
              sum of ₹43 lakhs by the petitioner to the respondent. In these
              circumstances, the discretion exercised by the Trial Court to require
              deposit of ₹34 lakhs (out of the claim of ₹85 lakhs) cannot be said to be
              unreasonable or perverse. The condition imposed accords with the law
              laid down in paragraph 17.4 of IDBI (supra), applicable to cases
              where the defence is plausible, but improbable.
              7. The judgment in Raj Duggal (supra) is also not of much assistance to
              the petitioner. Paragraph 3 of that judgment, on which learned counsel
              for the petitioner has sought to rely, lays down that judgment ought not
              to be entered where a triable defence of fact or law is raised. The
              impugned judgment in the present case does not decline leave to
              defend, but imposes a condition for the same. In fact, the final order of
       RFA No.965/2019                                                                Page 4 of 6

              the Court in Raj Duggal(supra) also granted conditional leave to
              defend.
              8. In the facts and circumstances aforesaid, the petitioner has not made
              out a case for exercise of jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of
              the Constitution. The petition is, therefore, dismissed."
7.     Despite dismissal of the CM(M) No.880/2019 the appellant did not
deposit the required amount with learned Trial Court, hence per
impugned judgment dated 16.08.2019, the suit of the respondent was
decreed. The relevant portion of the impugned judgment notes:-
              "7. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in view of
              noncompliance of the conditional order for leave to defend, suit is
              liable to be decreed for the amount of Rs. 74 Lakhs pertaining to two
              cheques with further interest @ 12 % per annum to the tune of Rs. 11
              Lakhs as claimed.
              8. Usually, the order in case of non-compliance of the
              conditional order is passed for the amount pertaining to the cheques
              issued towards liability. But certain developments in this case are
              important to be noted as are duly recorded in the order-sheets
              including the conduct of the plaintiff where plaintiff had denied receipt
              of Rs. 7 Lakhs on 24.07.2014 but his counsel on 08.09.2014 and
              admitted the mistake and filed the application for bringing on
              record the unconditional apology. The mediation settlement
              dated 30.09.2009 was to become void on two consecutive
              defaults and was noted by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the order
              sheet dated 04.04.2014 while restoring the suit.
              9. Keeping in view the developments in this case as noted above, the
              two cheques of Rs. 74 Lakhs having been issued from the account of
              AAA Handicrafts against a sum of Rs. 44 Lakhs between January 2005
              to February, 2005 received by cheque and remaining Rs. 33 Lakhs
              received in cash, I deem it proper to decree the suit for a sum of Rs. 74
              Lakhs only with interest @ 8 % per annum from the date of decree till
              realization with cost of the suit as per rules.
              10. No interest as claimed till filing of the suit and for pendentelite
              period is being granted in peculiar facts and circumstances of this case
              where there was settlement in mediation about withdrawal of this case
              against payment of Rs.43 Lakhs though it included settlement in respect
              of the case(s) filed against plaintiff also amongst some other complaint
              cases. Decree-sheet be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to
              Record-Room."
8.     In this appeal, the appellant once again is trying to raise issues
raised by him in his application for leave to defend and consequently in
CM (M) No.880/2019. The appellant cannot be allowed to re-agitate
same issues again. All that the appellant could have done in these
circumstances was to find solace in Order XXXVII Rule (3) (6) (b) CPC
       RFA No.965/2019                                                                Page 5 of 6

by alleging what prevented him to deposit Rs.34.00 lac in time. Order
XXXVII Rule (3) (6) (b) CPC notes:-
              “Order XXXVII Summary Procedure :-
              (3) Procedure for the appearance of defendant:--
                 (1) to (5) xxxx xxxx
                 (6) At the hearing of such summons for judgment :-
                 (a) xxx
                 (b) if the defendant is permitted to defend as to the whole or any
              part of the claim, the Court or Judge may direct him to give such
              security and within such time as may be fixed by the Court or Judge
              and that, on failure to give such security within the time specified by
              the Court or Judge or to carry out such other directions as may have
              been given by the Court or Judge, the plaintiff shall be entitled to
              judgment forthwith.”
9.    Thus, in this appeal, the appellant could have only pleaded the
circumstances which debarred him to deposit Rs.34.00 lac, as directed
vide order dated 28.03.2019 of granting conditional leave to defend to
him, lest there was no other alternative with the learned Trial Court
except to decree the suit, which rightly has been done so vide the
impugned judgment. The only other contention raised is the respondent
did not file any proof of encashment of cheques stated in paragraph
Nos.5 & 11 of the plaint. Such plea also ought to have been raised in the
application for leave to defend. It cannot be raised now.
10.   There is no other ground to entertain the appeal. The appeal,
therefore, is dismissed. The pending application, if any, also stands
dismissed. No order as to costs.
