                                                BEFORE
                  Hon’ble Mr. Justice Hitesh Kumar Sarma
                   Advocate for the petitioner : Mr. M Nath, Mr. A Roy,
                                                    Ms. S Boro, Mr. B Paul, Advocates.
                   Advocate for Respondent        : Mr. AR Sikdar, Mr. MH Talukdar, Advocates.
                   Date of hearing and Judgment & Order ::             27th of July, 2017.
                                 JUDGMENT & ORDER (Oral)
                   This is a petition, made under Section 482 Cr.P.C., for
       quashing the order, dated 23-06-2015, by which the learned
       Judicial Magistrate First Class, Goalpara, had taken cognizance of
       offences, under Sections 409/34 IPC, against the accused-
       petitioner, in Complaint Case No. 524C/2015.
       2.          I have heard Mr. M Nath, learned counsel appearing on
       behalf of accused-petitioner and Mr. AR Sikdar, learned counsel
       for the complainant- respondent.
       Crl. Pet. No. 213 of 2016                                                        Page 1 of 4

3.          I have perused the petition as well as the impugned order,
dated 23-06-2015. The learned trial Court, vide the said order, had
taken cognizance, against the accused-petitioner and another,
under Sections 409/34 IPC, after recording the statement of the
complainant under Section 200 Cr.P.C.
4.          Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that the criminal
case aforesaid be quashed as the subject-matter of the complaint
is civil in nature and there is no intention on the part of the
accused-petitioner to commit the criminal misappropriation.
5.          Learned counsel for complainant-respondent has submitted
that there is criminal intention on the part of the accused-
petitioner in not disbursing the amount to which he is entitled.
6.          It appears from the complaint petition, copy of which has
been furnished with the petition, that the Branch Manager of LICI,
Goalpara Branch, was also made an accused, although the
learned trial Court did not take cognizance against him, vide the
impugned order.
8.          The fact of the case is that the complainant-respondent
opened an insurance policy in the LICI, Goalpara Branch, under
Jeevan Saral Plan, on 18-11-2010, through the present petitioner
and co-accused, Sultan Ahmed, who is an agent of the LICI. The
present petitioner, Dhananjoy Ghosh, who is an accused in the
aforesaid CR Case, being the Development Officer of LICI,
Goalpara Branch. The complainant-respondent deposited an
amount of Rs. 2,26,110/-, with the LICI, Goalpara Branch, by way of
making quarterly payment of premium @ Rs. 18,375/-.
Crl. Pet. No. 213 of 2016                                    Page 2 of 4

9.          The complainant wanted to surrender the said policy and
submitted an application in this regard on 18-09-2013 to the
Branch Manager of Goalpara Branch of LICI. On surrender, the
LICI Goalpara Branch paid an amount of Rs. 1,18,749/- to the
accused-petitioner and the same has been credited in the Union
Bank         of India,        Goalpara  Branch   in  the   account of        the
complainant-respondent.                According    to   the   complainant-
respondent, he received less amount; therefore, he approached
the Branch Manager, accused No. 1 in the complaint (against
whom cognizance has not been taken) and they refused to help
the complainant-respondent. The complainant-respondent sent
legal notice on 10-03-2015, to the Branch Manager of LICI,
Goalpara Branch as well as to the present accused-petitioner and
his co-accused, i.e., the agent of the LICI.
10.         Since the Goalpara Branch of LICI did not take steps for
release of the balance amount of the surrendered policy, the
complainant-respondent filed a case for misappropriation of his
money, i.e., the instant complaint case. The learned trial Court, has
taken cognizance of the offences under Sections 409/34 IPC
against the present petitioner, but there is no instance in the
complaint              petition that  the  balance     amount,   which       the
complainant-respondent claims as due to him, has been
misappropriated by the present accused-petitioner.
11.         In the statement, recorded under Section 200 Cr.P.C. also,
there is no instance at all to show that the money, which he claims
to be entitled and not paid to him by the present petitioner, was
misappropriated by the accused-petitioner.
Crl. Pet. No. 213 of 2016                                          Page 3 of 4

12.         In the absence of any specific statement that the present
accused-petitioner, Development Officer of LICI, misappropriated
the amount to which the complainant-respondent is entitled, there
is no ground for taking cognizance. Admittedly, the complainant-
respondent, as per policy granted to him, paid the premium to the
LICI. That being so, the Development Officer is definitely not an
officer, who can disburse the amount; it is the Branch Manager,
who can disburse the amount as per the terms and conditions of
the policy.
13.         In view of above position, this Court does not find that the
cognizance taken by the learned trial Court on the complaint was
justified on the basis of the materials placed before it. That being
so, the present CR Case No. 524/2015, is quashed, as otherwise, it
would be an abuse of the process of the Court.
14.         However, during the course of interaction with the learned
counsel for the complainant-respondent, he has expressed his
willingness to approach the LICI Ombudsman for redressal of his
grievances which this Court appreciates without any comment on
that.
15.         Accordingly, the petition is disposed of.
                                                                JUDGE
