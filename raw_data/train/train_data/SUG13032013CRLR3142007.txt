                             Through:    Ms. Purnima Maheshwari, Advocate
                      versus

                             Through:    Mr. Sunil Sharma, Additional Public
                                         Prosecutor for respondent-State
       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR
                                 JUDGMENT
1.     Impugned order of 23rd February, 2007 convicting respondent-
accused persons for the offence under Section 324/34 of IPC and
sentencing them to the period already undergone with fine of `50,000/- to
be disbursed as compensation to the injured, is under challenge in this
revision petition by petitioner-injured.
2.     At the hearing, it was urged on behalf of petitioner that the offence
committed in this case falls under Section 326 of IPC whereas respondent-
accused persons have been convicted for the offence under Section 324 of
IPC which is unwarranted and so this revision petition deserves to be
allowed to the extent of altering the conviction of respondent-accused
persons from under Section 324 of IPC to under Section 326 of IPC, as
petitioner-injured had sustained two penetrating wounds i.e. of 1 cm X 1
Crl. Rev. P. No. 314/2007                                            Page 1 of 4

cm on the right side of his abdomen and of 3 cm X 3 cm on left side on left
lateral of his abdomen wall. It was pointed out by petitioner’s counsel that
the doctor had opined the injury to be dangerous as it has been found on
vital part of the body for which period of imprisonment undergone by
respondent-accused persons of less than a month is not an adequate
punishment and so they deserve to be suitably punished by altering their
conviction for the offence under Section 324 of IPC to Section 326 of IPC.
In support of above submissions, reliance is placed upon decisions in
Ramesh & Raj Kumar v. State 1989(1) Crimes 261 (Raj.); Niranjan Singh
v. State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 2007 SC 2434 and Crl. Appeal
No.710/2009 Sagar v. State rendered on 27th September, 2010.
3.     When this revision petition was admitted for final hearing, none had
appeared on behalf of respondent-accused persons and at the final hearing,
it was submitted by learned Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent-
State that since the injury sustained by injured had been opined to be
dangerous, therefore, respondent-accused persons ought to have been
convicted for the offence under Section 325 of IPC.
4.     Upon having heard both the sides and on perusal of the impugned
judgment and decisions cited, I find that merely because an injury has been
opined to be dangerous by the doctor, the said opinion would not be
binding on the Court, who can come to its own conclusion regarding the
nature of injury. This is what the trial judge has done in the impugned
order, whose operative portion reads as under: -
       “It is argued by Ld. APP that the injury was opined
       dangerous by the doctor. However there is no material to
Crl. Rev. P. No. 314/2007                                        Page 2 of 4

       show on record as to how this injury was opined to be
       dangerous by the said doctor. In fact depth of the stab
       wound is also not shown in the MLC. Therefore I am of
       the opinion that prosecution has not been able to prove
       its case beyond reasonable doubt that the injury caused
       was so deep that accused should be presumed to posses
       the knowledge that the such injury likely to cause death
       of the injured. In these circumstances I am of the opinion
       that prosecution has been able to prove a prima facie
       case under Section 324/34 IPC against both the accused
       persons. Accordingly I convict both of them under
       Section 324/34 IPC.”
5.     Since it is not the case of petitioner-injured that he had remained
admitted in hospital for a period of 20 days due to the injuries sustained in
this incident, therefore, the injuries sustained by petitioner have been
rightly treated to be constituting offence under Section 324 of IPC as the
depth of the injuries had not been given nor the injuries sustained are
shown to be extensive one. Thus, the offence committed by respondent-
accused persons would come within the ambit of Section 324/34 of IPC
and the sentence imposed upon them cannot be said to be inadequate and
so, the decisions relied upon by petitioner’s counsel are of no avail. Rather,
Apex Court in Kailash Prasad Kanodia and Anr. v. State of Bihar AIR
1980 SC 106 had altered the conviction from Section 326 to Section 324 of
IPC where medical evidence had not disclosed any serious injury on the
vital part of the body of the injured. In the instant case also, in view of the
nature and extent of injuries sustained by the petitioner, they cannot be
termed as grievous as its depth is not known.

6.     In light of the aforesaid, finding no illegality or infirmity in the
impugned order, I dismiss this petition.
