        learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam.
        Crl. A. (J) No. 73 of 2015                                                   Page 1 of 9

3.          The prosecution case is that, the informant, Ashima Bhuyan,
Inspector of Excise, Sipajhar Circle, received a telephonic message from
Dumoni Chowki, under Sipajhar Police Station, on 11-12-2013, at about
11.00 p.m. She immediately attended the place of occurrence and found
there an Alto Car, bearing registration No. AS-01-AK-1693. The accused-
appellant was the registered owner of the said vehicle. He was
apprehended with 28 kgs of Cannabis (Ganja). He was arrested for
commission of offence under Section 20(b)(ii)(c) of the NDPS Act. The
accused-appellant, apart from being the registered owner, was also the
driver of the vehicle. The Ext. 4, FIR, was addressed to the District and
Sessions Judge, Darrang, Mangaldai, by the informant. (This is as per
record).
4.          On appearance of the accused-appellant before the learned
Special Judge (Sessions Judge), Darrang, Mangaldai, charge under
Section 20(b)(ii)(c) of the NDPS Act was framed against him, to which
he pleaded innocence.
5.          During the course of trial, the prosecution examined as many as
five witnesses and the defence examined one witness.
6.          PW1, Khatibuddin Ahmed, is an Assistant Inspector of Excise. His
evidence is that on 11-12-2013, on receipt of information regarding
possession of contraband, they proceeded to the place called Dumni
Chowki, at about 11.00 p.m. and found a Maruti Car by the side of
NH52, in damaged condition, as the said car met with an accident. The
accused was found sitting inside the car and in the rare seat of the car,
they found a bag containing ganja like substance. Then, the Inspector of
Excise, Ashima Bhuyan seized the said suspected contraband and
prepared the seizure list, Ext.1, wherein he is a witness, vide his signature
marked as Ext.1(1). In his cross-examination, he is found to have stated
that on their arrival, they found the accused-appellant sitting in a
Crl. A. (J) No. 73 of 2015                                        Page 2 of 9

driver’s seat and that they did not see any other passenger in the car.
They were told by the accused-appellant that two persons hired the car
and they loaded the seized contraband. Admittedly, they did not make
any effort to apprehend the said two passengers, said to have travelled
in the said car.
7.          The PW2, Idrish Ali, is another witness to the seizure. This
witness came to the place of occurrence, after hearing a sound on the
high way, and found a damaged car standing by the side of NH52,
which was hit by another car and left. There, he also saw the Excise
Department personnel bringing out a big polythene bag from the said
vehicle and he was witness to the seizure by putting his thumb
impression. He had seen ganja in the bag.
8.          PW3, Khasnur Ali, is also a witness to the seizure. He is found to
have deposed that, while coming home, riding a bicycle, near Khara
bridge he found the Alto Car standing by the side of NH52 and some
people were there from before. He stopped there. The people gathered
there informed him that two passengers of the Alto Car standing by the
side of the NH52 had already fled and the accused-appellant was
detained by public, whom he identified in the Court. He informed
police as well as Excise Department about the incident over phone. The
Excise officials arrived at the place of occurrence and found some bags
wrapped with clothes, which were seized in his presence. He was
witness to the seizure, vide his signature, marked Ext. 1(2). In his cross-
examination he said that the accused-appellant was the driver of the
said car.
9.          PW4, Ashima Bhuyan, Inspector of Excise, is the informant of the
case. Her evidence is that, on 11-12-2013, she found the accused-
appellant at a place called Saraikash, at about 9.00/10.00 p.m. and
found him possessing ganja. The accused-appellant was sitting in the
Crl. A. (J) No. 73 of 2015                                           Page 3 of 9

driver’s seat. There was no other passenger in the car. She lodged the
offence report against the accused-appellant, vide Ext.2. She found 28
kgs of suspected ganja in the car and seized the same, vide Ext. 1. She
found 28 kgs of Bhutia ganja. She also obtained the chemical analysis
report from the Forensic Science Laboratory, Kahilipara, Guwahati, in
respect of the seized suspected ganja.
10.         PW4, Sri Rokheswar Bora, is the chemical Analyst of the
Government of Assam. He had received the sample from Inspector of
Excise, Sipajhar, vide letter No. DEX(SIP)6/2013-14 dated 16-12-2013.
The sample contains stalks, leaves and fruiting tops of ganja. On
chemical examination, he found the same to be cannabis indica and it
tested positive for rasin cannabis indica. Ext. 5 is the report of the
Analyst. Ext. 5(1) is his signature. In his cross-examination, he is found to
have stated that the sample was directly sent to him by the Excise
Inspector.
11.         It appears from the above evidence of the witnesses that
suspected ganja (cannabis), in the instant case, was seized from the Alto
Car, which was owned and driven by the accused-appellant. PW4 is
found to have deposed that on examination of the sample of the seized
ganja, he found the same tested positive for rasin cannabis indica.
12.         Now, let us see whether the said contraband was found and
seized from the possession of the accused-appellant.
13.         The provisions of Sections 42 and 43 of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substance Act provide for the power of entry, search,
seizure and arrest without warrant or authorization. For the sake of
clarity, Sections 42 and 43 are extracted below:

            Section 43 in The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
            Act, 1985
            43. Power of seizure and arrest in public place.Any officer of
            any of the departments mentioned in section 42 may
            (a) seize in any public place or in transit, any narcotic drug or
            psychotropic substance or controlled substance in respect of
            which he has reason to believe an offence punishable under this
            Act has been committed, and, along with such drug or substance,
            any animal or conveyance or article liable to confiscation under
            this Act, any document or other article which he has reason to
            believe may furnish evidence of the commission of an offence
            punishable under this Act or any document or other article which
            may furnish evidence of holding any illegally acquired property
            which is liable for seizure or freezing or forfeiture under Chapter
            VA of this Act;
            (b) detain and search any person whom he has reason to believe
            to have committed an offence punishable under this Act, and if
            such person has any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or
            controlled substance in his possession and such possession
            appears to him to be unlawful, arrest him and any other person
            in his company. Explanation.For the purposes of this section,
            the expression "public place" includes any public conveyance,
            hotel, shop, or other place intended for use by, or accessible to,
            the public.
14.         On reading of the provisions of Section 42 of the Act, it appears
that only the officers mentioned therein and empowered in that behalf,
can make search, seizure and arrest, provided they have reasons to
believe,         from      personal knowledge    or  information,    about      the
commission of an offence under the Act, after reducing the information
into writing. As per the provisions of Section 42, the officer of the Excise
Department is competent to search and seize. Section 43 of the Act
Crl. A. (J) No. 73 of 2015                                            Page 6 of 9

provides for seizure and arrest in public place by the officers
enumerated in Section 42 of the Act.
15.         The informant, in the instant case, is the Excise Inspector and is
an officer enumerated in Section 42 of the Act. Therefore, she is
competent to make the search and seizure.
16.         In the instant case, the car from which the contraband was
allegedly seized was standing by the side of the NH52. There is no
dispute that National Highway is a public place. Therefore, in respect of
search and seizure, in the instant case, provisions of Section 43 of the
Act is applicable.
17.         The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Karnail Singh –vs-
State of Haryana, reported in (2009) 8 SCC 539, at paragraph 26,
observed as follows:
            12) The material difference between the provisions of Sections 42 and
            43 is that Section 42 requires recording of reasons for belief and for
            taking down of information received in writing with regard to the
            commission of an offence before conducting search and seizure, Section
            43 does not contain any such provision and as such while acting under
            Section 43 of the Act, the empowered officer has the power of seizure
            of the article etc. and arrest of a person who is found to be in
            possession of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance in a public
            place where such possession appears to him to be unlawful.
18.         So, it appears that Section 43, does not require recording of
reasons for belief and for taking down the information received in
writing before conducting search and seizure.
19.         However, as required by the provisions of Section 50 of the Act,
the person searched has to be taken to a Gazetted Officer or a
Magistrate, if such person requires, without unnecessary delay. The
accused-appellant, in the instant case, searched by the informant, who is
a Gazetted Officer, but the accused-appellant was not informed about
Crl. A. (J) No. 73 of 2015                                             Page 7 of 9

his right to be searched in presence of a Magistrate, therefore, Section
50 of the NDPS Act has been violated in this case.
20.         That apart, there is no instance in the evidence on records that
Section 57 of the Act is complied with. After the seizure was made and
the accused-appellant was arrested, arresting officer is mandatorily
required to make a full report of all particulars of arrest or seizure to his
immediate superior. There is even no whisper of compliance of this
provision in the evidence, led by the prosecution. In the absence of any
evidence, as aforesaid, Section 57 of the NDPS Act has not been
complied with in this case.
21.         There is also no evidence on record at all to show that the
sample was collected from the suspected contraband, in presence of the
accused-appellant and the witnesses, and also about the quantum of
sample sent for chemical examination. There is also no evidence as to
where the sample was taken. There is even no evidence led by the
prosecution, particularly, the informant, Ashima Bhuya, who is also the
officer making the seizure and search of the accused-appellant, to show
that she had taken sample of the contraband. It is a fact that PW4 stated
that he received the sample of the contraband containing stalks and
leaves and fruiting tops of ganja from the informant, yet there is no
evidence at all that the sample examined by him, was the sample of
contraband, seized from the possession of the accused-appellant.
22.         On the other hand, although the informant, in her evidence,
categorically stated that 28 kgs of Bhutiya Ganja was seized, yet there is
no instance on the record to show that it was weighed, and if weighed,
where and in whose presence. No evidence at all was led to that effect.
23.         In the absence of any evidence, on the above aspects, the fact of
the search, seizure and sending of sample from the allegedly seized
Crl. A. (J) No. 73 of 2015                                        Page 8 of 9

contraband cannot be said to have been proved, although the
prosecution is statutorily bound to prove the same.
24.         In view of such evidence on record, as discussed above, in the
considered view of this Court, the prosecution has failed to prove the
accusations levelled against the accused-appellant, and therefore, he is
entitled to be acquitted.
25.         In view of the above, the judgment and order, convicting and
sentencing the accused-appellant, as aforesaid, is set aside. The accused-
appellant is acquitted.
26.         Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
27.          The accused-appellant be released forthwith.
28.         Send down the LCR with a copy of the judgment.
29.         Send a copy of this judgment to the Superintendent of Jail,
Mangaldai, who will furnish a copy of the same to the accused-
appellant.
30.         This Court records its appreciation for the assistance rendered by
learned Amicus Curiae, Ms. Purnima Baruah Bordoloi. Learned Amicus
Curiae be paid an amount of Rs. 7,000/-, as remuneration.
                                                                      JUDGE
