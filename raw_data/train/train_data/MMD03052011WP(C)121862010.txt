            PRESENT:
                         THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE M. M. DAS
M.M. DAS, J.               The    aforesaid    writ   petitions    are    series of
           applications filed by the members of the Managing Committee of
           a recognized Upper Primary School, namely, Vira Surendra Sai
           Vidya Mandir, V.S.S. Nagar, Bhubaneswar.
           2.              Facts involved in the aforesaid cases disclose a
           sorry state of affairs with regard to managing an Upper Primary
           School in the capital city of Bhubaneswar and allegations are
           made relating to forcibly restraining a recognized Managing
           Committee from functioning as such and managing the affairs of
           the school.

                                   4
                W.P. (C) No. 2667 of 2010
3.              Bereft of unnecessary details, it will suffice to
narrate the facts from a point when a duly constituted Managing
Committee of the said school was approved upon reconstitution
on 10.7.2007 as per the letter at Annexure-2 in W.P. (C) No. 2667
of 2010. The reconstituted Managing Committee made several
representations to the Headmaster through the petitioners 1 to 6
in W.P. (C) No. 2667 of 2010 requesting him to call the first
meeting of the Managing Committee. As no meeting was
convened by the Headmaster, it filed W.P. (C) No. 9352 of 2007.
However, the said writ petition was withdrawn on the ground that
they will approach the Director, Elementary Education and the
District Inspector of Schools. On 20..5.2008, the Headmaster
Shri B.K. Rout wrote a letter to the Inspector of Schools that he
has not been able to convene the first meeting as he did not have
the names and addresses of the new members and the petitioners
1 to 6 in W.P. (C) No. 2667 of 2010 have resigned between
January to April, 2007 as they were not willing to continue as
members.     Thereafter,  several   correspondences    were  made
between the authority and the Headmaster, who was repeatedly
directed to convene the meeting. The petitioners 1 to 7 filed W.P.
(C) No. 9483 of 2008 seeking a direction of this Court to the opp.
parties to convene the first meeting of the reconstituted Managing

                                  5
Committee. The said writ petition was disposed of on 30.7.2008
directing the Headmaster to convene the first meeting within a
period of two weeks from the date of receipt of the said order. The
Headmaster even after receiving the said order did not convene
the meeting. The above petitioners again filed W.P. (C) No. 12127
of 2008 to restrain the Headmaster,         Shri B.K. Rout from
operating the Bank account of the school and also filed Contempt
Application, being CONTC No. 1201 of 2008 for non-compliance
of the order dated 30.7.2008 passed in W.P. (C) No. 9483 of 2008.
A Writ Appeal, being W.A. No. 199 of 2008 was filed by the said
Headmaster challenging the order dated 30.7.2008         passed in
W.P. (C) No. 9483 of 2008 as well as the order dated 22.9.2008
passed in Misc. Case No. 10185 of 2008. The Writ Appeal was
dismissed on 4.11.2008. Only thereafter, the Headmaster on
5.11.2008 requested the members of the reconstituted Managing
Committee to attend the first meeting to be held for electing the
President   and   Secretary   of the   Managing     Committee    as
admittedly, the school is an unaided school. It is alleged by the
petitioners in W.P. (C) No. 2667 of 2010 that on the said date, at
the behest of the Headmaster, some unruly crowd prevented
them for holding the meeting by locking up of the front gate of
the school premises, upon which, the District Inspector of
Schools also made a report on 30.11.2008. In CONTC No. 1201 of

                                  6
2008, the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar was directed to take
immediate    steps  for  convening    the   first meeting  of the
reconstituted Managing Committee within a period of three
weeks.     This Court on 10.12.2008 in the said contempt
application made an observation that the Headmaster was trying
to put a Monkey’s wrench in complying with the direction of this
Court. Some typographical errors crept in the said order passed
in the contempt application. On 19.12.2010, Misc. Case No. 235
of 2008 was filed for correction of the said typographical error,
which was done by order dated 24.12.2008. In spite of the said
order, the same being not complied with, CONTC No. 145 of 2009
was filed. On 2.2.2009 the Sub-Collector intimated that the first
meeting of the Managing Committee shall be held on 9.2.2009.
On the said date, however, it is alleged that the ex-Headmaster,
B.K. Rout and many others did not allow the members of the
Managing Committee to enter inside the school premises for
which, a further contempt application, being CONTC No. 273 of
2009 was filed. Ultimately, the first meeting of the Managing
Committee was held on 25.2.2009 in the office of the Sub-
Collector, where the petitioner no. 4 - P.C. Pattnaik was elected
as the Secretary and the petitioner no. 5 – Shri B.B. Ray was
elected   as  the  President   of   the   reconstituted  Managing
Committee. On 1.3.2009, a Parents Steering Committee/general

                                    7
body of parents, which according to the petitioners in W.P. (C)
No. 2667 of 2010 was illegally constituted, resolved not to accept
the reconstituted Managing Committee and not to allow the
members of the said committee to function as the Managing
Committee of the school. Such resolution has been annexed as
Annexure-A to Misc. Case No. 20734 of 2010. On 17.3.2009, the
Sub-Collector handed over the complete charge to the newly
constituted Managing Committee, which initiated disciplinary
proceeding against the Headmaster in–charge, B.K. Rout and
Senior Assistant Teacher Shri Hrudananda Behera on 25.3.2009.
Ultimately, the services of the said two teachers were terminated
by the Managing Committee. On 18.1.2010, the members of the
reconstituted Managing Committee made a representation to the
State – opp. party no. 1 to count the tenure of the said Managing
Committee from 25.2.2009 on which date, the first meeting of the
said committee was held and the Secretary and President were
elected. As no action was taken, some of the said members filed
W.P.(C) No. 2667 of 2010 with a prayer to count the tenure of
the reconstituted Managing Committee from 25.2.2009.In M.C.
No. 2189 of 2010, filed in W.P. (C) No. 2667 of 2010, a direction
was issued that the Managing Committee shall continue to
function as the Managing Committee of the school until further
orders and the said order is still continuing.

                                     8
                 W.P.(C) No. 12186/2010
4.               This writ petition has also been filed by the
members of the reconstituted Managing Committee of the school
with a prayer to issue a writ/direction directing the opp. parties
to carry out immediate inspection of the school as per the
provisions of Orissa Education Code.
                 W.P.(C No. 19993 of 2010
5.               This writ petition has been filed by the members
of the reconstituted Managing Committee of the above school
with prayer to issue a direction to the opp. parties to ensure that
the   reconstituted    Managing     Committee   functions   smoothly
without any hindrance. In Misc. Case No. 18572 of 2010 arising
out of this writ petition, a direction was issued to the Inspector of
Schools to make an inspection of the school with regard to the
allegations made in the writ petition and submit a specific report
thereon before this Court. It was further directed that if he finds
that    any   outsiders are collecting fees from the students on
account of admission, readmission or tuition fees, he shall inform
the I.I.C., Saheednagar Police Station by lodging an F.I.R. to that
effect immediately against such persons.
                 The   Inspector    in-charge  submitted   a  report
pursuant to the order of this Court to the effect that on his
inspection made on 1.12.2010 and 4.12.2010, he found that the

                                    9
school in question is an unaided recognized Upper Primary
School under the administrative control of the District Inspector
of Schools, Bhubaneswar. It appears that 459 students from
Class KG-I to Class – VIII are reading in the school in two shifts.
As per staff attendance register, 25 nos. of staff are now working
in the school. The Managing Committee of the school has been
approved by the D.I. of Schools, Bhubaneswar by order dated
10.7.2007     pursuant to the order passed by this Court on
3.5.2007 in W.P. (C) No. 19704 of 2004 and as ascertained by
him, the approved Managing Committee is not functioning
properly due to dispute. He found that the school is managed by
a committee named as “Parents’ Steering Committee” constituted
in a general body meeting on 16.11.2008. The said committee
consists of ten members, who were all parents. The children of
four members out of them passed out in the meanwhile. The said
Steering Committee is presently managing the school. The
parents, therefore, may not be treated as outsiders. There is no
provision for constitution of “Parents’ Steering Committee” under
the   Orissa     Education     (Establishment,   Recognition   and
Management of Private Upper Primary Schools) Rules, 1991
(hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”) and the same has not been
approved by any competent authority. Therefore, the said
committee has no valid approval behind it. The said committee

                                   10
has    taken   different  decisions   in   different  meetings   for
management of the school, collection of funds and management
of finance etc. Even in resolution taken on 6.3.20099, the said
committee has decided to print receipt books for collection in the
name of Parents’ Steering Committee, to open a joint account in
the name of two guardians, to constitute a four member finance
committee, to approve all actions taken by “Parents’ Steering
Committee” every two months, to pay salary to teachers and staff,
to deposit EPF subscription and to audit the accounts by a
Chartered Accountant. Such receipt books have been used with
effect from 13.3.2009 for collection of fees from the students. The
committee has paid salary of all the staff. They have maintained
financial statement and have opened an account in the Syndicate
Bank, but they refused to disclose the account number on the
ground that if the account is seized, they will face inconvenience
in managing the school.
                W.P. (C) No. 1696 of 2011
6.              This writ petition has been filed by ten petitioners
claiming themselves to be the guardians of the students, who are
prosecuting their studies in the said school with a prayer to issue
a writ in the nature of mandamus or a direction to the Director,
Elementary    Education, Orissa     to constitute the Managing
Committee in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the

                                    11
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
(hereinafter referred to as “the Act, 2009” ).
                 W.P.(C) No. 2439 of 2011
6.               This writ petition has been filed by the 14
petitioners claiming themselves      to be the teaching staff of the
above school with a prayer to issue a writ of mandamus or a
direction to the opp. parties to constitute            the Managing
Committee of the school within a reasonable time to be stipulated
by the Court as per the provisions of the Act, 2009 or in the
alternative to direct the opp. party no. 2 – Director to reconstitute
the Managing Committee as per the Orissa Education Act and the
Rules within a reasonable time to be stipulated.
7.               Various Misc. Cases have been filed in each of the
writ petitions by the respective parties to intervene in the writ
petitions filed by the opposition parties.
8.               Mr. R.K. Rath, learned senior counsel appearing
for the petitioners in W.P. (C) Nos. 2667, 12186 and 19993 of
2010 submitted that though section 7(4) of the Orissa Education
Act    prescribes that a Managing Committee shall continue in
office for a term of three years from the date of its approval by the
prescribed     authority  under    sub-section  (2)   and   shall  be
reconstituted in accordance with law, but juxtaposing this
section with rule 28 (2) of the Rules, which provides that the first

                                   12
meeting of the reconstituted Managing Committee shall be
convened immediately on receipt of approval of the prescribed
authority under sub-rule (1)      by the Headmaster/teacher in-
charge of Headmaster of the school and the District Inspector of
Schools, shall preside over the said meeting       for election of
President of the Managing Committee, these provisions       clearly
show that unless the meeting of the reconstituted Managing
Committee is convened by the Headmaster and the President and
Secretary   are    elected,   for   all  practical purposes,    the
reconstituted Managing Committee cannot start to function. He,
therefore, submitted that on the facts of these cases, it would be
clear that though the Managing Committee was approved with
effect from 10.7.2007, but in effect, it was made functional only
when repeated orders were passed by this Court in previous writ
petitions and contempt applications were filed, and, ultimately,
the first meeting was held on the intervention of this Court by
directing the Sub-Collector to convene the meeting as late as on
25.2.2009. Mr. Rath further submitted that applying the doctrine
of purposive interpretation, it would be appropriate to hold that
though section 7 (4) of the Act mentions that the tenure of the
reconstituted Managing Committee is for three years from the
date of its approval, but to manage the affairs of the school is
only possible after holding of the first meeting of the said

                                    13
Managing Committee in which meeting, there shall be election of
its President and Secretary. Hence, the said tenure of three years
should be calculated from the date, when the first meeting was
convened and the President and Secretary were elected, which, in
the instant case, is from 25.2.2009. Mr. Rath further contended
that as reported by the Inspector of Schools pursuant to the
direction of this Court, the Parents’ Steering Committee is an
illegally constituted body which cannot be permitted under any
circumstances to manage the affairs of the school.
9.               Mr. Routray and Mr. J.K. Rath, learned senior
counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P. (C) Nos. 1696 and
2439 of 2011 vehemently urged that once the tenure of the
Managing Committee has already expired by counting three years
from the date of its approval, it cannot be contended that the said
period can be extended under any circumstances, as law does
not provide for such extension.
10.              Without entering into the above dispute, as this
Court finds that there is series of disturbances in managing the
affairs of the   school in question, in spite of the fact that the
Inspector has reported that the disturbance in the management
has not affected     imparting of education in the school to the
students and further considering the fact that pursuant to an
interim order, the      reconstituted Managing Committee was

                                  14
permitted to function until further orders, for which they have
not submitted any proposal for reconstitution of the Managing
Committee before ninety days from the date of expiry of its term
as per Rule 27 of the Rules, it would be appropriate to allow the
said Managing Committee to submit a proposal for reconstitution
of the Managing Committee within a period of three weeks from
today by holding a meeting of the said Managing Committee and
taking a resolution to that effect in accordance with Rule 27 of
the Rules. Such proposal as per the resolution should be
submitted by the elected Secretary of the said Managing
Committee, i. e., Shri Purna Chandra Pattnaik, petitioner no. 4
in W.P. (C) No. 2667 of 2010 as per Rule 27 (2) of the Rules.
Upon submission of such proposal and within a period of four
weeks therefrom, the prescribed authority shall take a final
decision thereon with regard to reconstitution of the Managing
Committee in accordance with law.       Till reconstitution of the
Managing Committee, i.e., for a period of seven weeks from today,
the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar shall manage the affairs of the
school.  All  the  parties  are  restrained   from   creating  any
disturbance with regard to management of the affairs of the
school by the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar.

the writ petitions are disposed. Consequently, all pending Misc.
Cases also stand disposed of.
