                 1.      Leave granted.
                 2.      Mr. Mishra Sourabh, learned counsel appears for the
                 State of Madhya Pradesh and accepts notice.
                 3.      This   is  a   case   where    the   appellant   was   not
                 regularized as a Forest Guard on the ground that he had
                 contracted marriage before attaining the age of 21 years.
                 Apparently, there is only a difference of a few days.
                 4.      One of the grounds taken by the appellant in this
                 case is that several others have been granted relaxation.
                 5.      Four such instances have been pointed out before this
                 Court, they are Narayan Prasad Raikwar, Babulal Carpenter,
                 Raj Kishore Tiwari and Bhagatram Raikwar.
                 6.      If that be so, there is no point in keeping this
