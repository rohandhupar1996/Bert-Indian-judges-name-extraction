        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
                            JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J.
1.      These are cross-objections to the MAC. APP. No.525/2009 filed
        by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd. The main appeal bearing
        MAC. APP. No.525/2009 was dismissed as withdrawn by an
        order dated 16.11.2010. The cross-objections are now being
        decided by this judgment.
2.      A petition under Section 163(A) of the Motor Vehicles Act (the
        Act) was preferred by the Respondents (hereinafter referred to
        as Claimants) claiming a compensation of ` 10,00,000/- for the
        death of their son Shehzad, who was aged 23 years at the time
        of accident.

3.      Since, the petition was under Section 163(A) of the Act the
        Claimants were not required to prove the negligence on the part
        of the driver of the offending vehicle. The Tribunal took the
        deceased’s annual income to be ` 40,000/-, deducted 50%
        towards personal living expenses of the deceased, applied a
        multiplier of ‘13’ to reach the loss of dependency as `
        2,60,000/-. The Tribunal further awarded conventional sum of `
        10,000/- towards loss of estate, ` 10,000/- towards funeral
        expenses and ` 20,000/- for loss of love and affection.
4.      The Claimants have averred that the compensation awarded is
        not just and fair.
5.      In the second schedule to Section 163(A) of the Act, the
        Claimants are required to prove the deceased’s income though it
        is not necessary to prove the negligence on the part of the driver
        of the offending vehicle.       PW-1 Smt. Razia Begum the
        deceased’s mother stated in her cross-examination that she did
        not have any proof to show that her son was working as a Tailor
        and earning ` 40,000/- per annum. She denied the suggestion
        that her son was unemployed. There is no evidence as to the
        deceased’s qualification. Thus the Tribunal was not justified in
        taking the deceased’s income to be ` 40,000/- per annum. The
        income which could have been taken in the absence of any
        proof could be the minimum wages of an unskilled worker as
        notified by the Govt. of Delhi on the date of the accident. The
        same were ` 3,044.90 paise per month rounded off ` 3,045/- per
MAC APP 1/2011                                                   Page 2 of 3

        month or ` 36,540/- a year. Since the petition was filed under
        Section 163(A) of the Act, the deduction towards the personal
        expenses ought to have been 1/3rd as given in the second
        schedule and not 50% and the multiplier according to the
        deceased’s age i.e. 23 years is ‘17’. The loss of dependency
        thus works out as ` 4,14,120/-. After adding the conventional
        sum towards loss of love and affection ` 20,000/-, towards loss
        of estate ` 10,000/- and funeral expenses ` 10,000/- as awarded
        by the Tribunal, the overall compensation is assessed as `
        4,54,120/-. Thus, there is enhancement of ` 1,54,120/-, which
        shall carry interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of
        the petition till the date of payment. The Appellant in the main
        appeal i.e. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. is directed to comply
        with the order and make payment within six weeks.
6.      Out of the enhanced compensation a sum of ` 54,120/- along
        with proportionate interest shall be paid to the first Respondent.
        Rest of the amount shall go to the second Respondent. 30% of
        the amount shall be released forthwith; rest of the compensation
        shall be held in Fixed Deposit for a period of three years.
                                                         (G.P. MITTAL)
