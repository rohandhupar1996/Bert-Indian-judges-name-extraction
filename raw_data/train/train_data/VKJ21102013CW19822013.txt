HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K.JAIN
                                 JUDGMENT
V.K.JAIN, J. (Oral)
        The petitioner-Company made a reference to BIFR under Section
15 (1) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985
(hereinafter referred to as the „SICA‟) which declared the petitioner-
Company sick vide order dated 22.6.1999. The State Bank of India
(SBI) was appointed as the Operating Agency to examine the viability
of the company and formulate a rehabilitation plan for its revival, in
case it was found viable. Vide order dated 7.3.2006 the BIFR confirmed
its prima facie opinion formed on 22.12.2003 to wind up the Company
in terms of Section 20 (1) of the SICA. The BIFR also directed that the
opinion formed by it be forwarded to the concerned High Court and the
Company should not dispose of any of its assets without prior approval
of the Board during the period beginning with the recording of opinion
W.P.(C) No.1982 of 2013                                     Page 1 of 6

by it and up to the commencing of proceedings relating to winding up
before the concerned High Court.
        The order passed by BIFR on 7.3.2006 was challenged by the
petitioner by way of an appeal before the Appellate Authority for
Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (for short „AAIFR‟). However,
vide order dated 3.6.2009, the appeal filed by the petitioner-Company
was dismissed.
2.      Earlier during the pendency of the proceedings before the BIFR,
the petitioner had filed CW No.3023/2003 against some interim orders
passed by BIFR. When the said writ petition came up for hearing on
5.5.2003, the following interim order was passed:
                “CW No.3023 of 2003 & CM 5132/2003
                Ld. Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that he
        has no objection in depositing Rs.25 lakhs as directed by the
        AAIFR but that money must be utilized to revive or rehabilitate
        the sick company. We order accordingly. He undertakes to
        deposit this amount in a non-lien account within two weeks
        from today.
                Notice to the respondents to show cause as to why this
        petition be not admitted returnable on 8th August, 2003.
                In pursuance to the advertisement issued on 22nd January,
        2003 in Tribune no further steps be taken for a period of two
        weeks.”
        The aforesaid writ petition was withdrawn vide order dated
8.8.2003. However, the amount of Rs.25.00 lakh which the petitioner
had deposited in a no-lien account with the SBI pursuant to the interim
order dated 5.5.2003 was not withdrawn though, in view of withdrawal
W.P.(C) No.1982 of 2013                                     Page 2 of 6

of the writ petition, the petitioner was entitled in law to withdraw the
aforesaid amount.
3.      Being aggrieved from the dismissal of its appeal before AAIFR
the petitioner filed WP (C) No.11216/2009 before this Court. When the
aforesaid writ petition came up for hearing on 16.2.2010, the following
order was passed:
        “WP (C) No.11216/2009 and CM APPL Nos. 10658-59/09 and
        984/2010
                Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to give up
        challenge to the impugned order and confines relief to the
        consideration of his application for one-time settlement (OTS)
        scheme in accordance with norms and for the amount deposited
        by him in no-lien account to be taken into consideration for
        consideration of such OTS proposal.
                We are inclined to accept the said request making it clear
        that it is up to the respondents to examine the OTS proposal in
        accordance with their norms and the amount deposited in the
        no-lien account, which is to be transferred to the Official
        Liquidator, will be considered as a part of the amount required
        to be deposited by the petitioner for consideration of the OTS
        proposal.
                The petition and the application stand disposed of.”
4.      It would, thus, be seen that the amount of Rs.25.00 lakh which the
petitioner had deposited in a no-lien account with SBI pursuant to the
interim order passed in CW No.3023/2003 and which was not
withdrawn by it, was to be considered as a deposit made by the
petitioner in order to enable the respondents in WP (C) No.11216/2009
to consider the proposal of the said petitioner for a one-time settlement
(OTS) and was to be transferred by the Official Liquidator, to the
W.P.(C) No.1982 of 2013                                      Page 3 of 6

creditors who were to consider the OTS proposal.               It would be
appropriate to mention here that the aforesaid amount came under the
control of the Official Liquidator since it was deposited in a no-lien
account with SBI which then transferred the said amount to the Official
Liquidator.
5.      The learned counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner has
already deposited some amount with Punjab Financial Corporation
(PFC) and Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation (PSIDC) in
order to enable the said Corporations to consider its proposal for an
OTS. He further submits that despite the order passed by a Division
Bench of this Court in WP (C) No.11216/2009 on 16.2.2010 the Official
Liquidator has not transferred the amount deposited in no-lien account
to the aforesaid creditors of the petitioner, as a result of which the said
creditors are not considering the request of the petitioner for an OTS.
The petitioner has accordingly sought the following reliefs in the present
writ petition:
        “a. issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ
        directing the respondent to release the amount transferred to it
        by SBI in favour of the petitioner – company;
        b.      the amount be released directly to PFC and PSIDC in
        view of OTS arrived at between the parties in their respective
        proportion.”
6.      The learned counsel for the Official Liquidator admits that PFC as
well as PSIDC are also creditors of the petitioner-Company.               He,
however, submits that the amount of Rs.25.00 lakh belongs to the
Company and it has to be utilized for payment to the creditors of the
Company in the order of preference, prescribed in terms of Sections
529, 529A and 530 of the Companies Act.
W.P.(C) No.1982 of 2013                                      Page 4 of 6

7.      In my view, considering that CW No.3023/2003 came to be
withdrawn by the petitioner it had a legal right to withdraw the aforesaid
amount of Rs.25.00 lakh which it had deposited in a no-lien account
with SBI, Chandigarh. Therefore, the petitioner would have a legal
right to utilize the said amount for the purposes of the petitioner-
Company and that would include the request of the petitioner-Company
to its creditors to consider an OTS of their dues. In any case, in view of
order dated 16.2.2010 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in WP
(C) No.11216/2009, the Official Liquidator has no option but to transfer
the aforesaid amount to those creditors of the petitioner-Company who
are to consider its request for an OTS of their dues.
8.      When this writ petition came up for hearing on 18.9.2013, the
learned counsel representing the Official Liquidator sought four (4)
weeks‟ time to consider the matter in the light of the order dated
16.2.2010 passed in WP (C) No.11216/2009. It was made clear in the
aforesaid order that in case the respondent is aggrieved from the order
dated 16.2.2010 passed in WP (C) No.11216/2009 it would either have
to approach the Division Bench which passed the said order or a
superior court for ventilation of its grievance. Admittedly, the Official
Liquidator has neither approached the Division Bench which passed the
order dated 16.2.2010 nor has it challenged the said order before a
superior court. The learned counsel for the Official Liquidator states
that since the Company has not wound up so far they would have no
right to challenge the aforesaid order dated 16.2.2010. Be that as it may
considering that the aforesaid amount of Rs.25.00 lakh was deposited by
the petitioner pursuant to interim order passed in CW No.3023/2003
which later on came to be withdrawn by it and the specific order dated
W.P.(C) No.1982 of 2013                                    Page 5 of 6

16.2.2010 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in WP (C)
No.11216/2009 directing the transfer of the aforesaid amount by the
Official Liquidator to the creditors of the petitioner-Company there is no
escape from the conclusion that the Official Liquidator cannot retain the
aforesaid amount and it has to be transferred to the creditors which are
to consider the request of the petitioner for an OTS.          The learned
counsel for the petitioner states that a sum of Rs.15,76,184.00 is
required to be transferred to PFC and the remaining amount to PSIDC.
Accordingly, the respondent is directed to transfer an amount of
Rs.15,76,184.00 out of Rs.25.00 lakh along with interest accrued
thereon to Punjab Financial Corporation by way of a cheque in its name
and the balance Rs.9,23,816.00 along with interest accrued thereon to
Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation by way of a cheque in
its name within four (4) weeks from today.
        The writ petition and the application stand disposed of.
        Dasti.
