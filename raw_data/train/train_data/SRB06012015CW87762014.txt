1.      These three writ petitions involve adjudication on common issues
arising     from      the    same     facts,   i.e. interpretation  of   tender   no.
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                              Page 2

LPG/LOGS/TT/ER/2014/A dated 01.09.2014 issued jointly by the three
contesting respondents – hereafter referred to conveniently as “the oil
marketing companies”. The petitioners in W.P.(C) 8776/2014 argue that the
rejection of their bids on the ground that the mismatch between the prime
mover capacity and the trailer capacity made the bid non-conforming, is
arbitrary. The petitioners in this writ petition are referred to compendiously
as “the Baroda group”. The petitioners in W.P.(C) 8435/2014 (hereafter
called “the Malik Group”), on the other hand, assert that the oil marketing
companies should strictly follow the tender conditions and reject the tanker
contracts (TTs) which do not conform to the prescribed specifications. They
seek consequent directions for quashing of actions taken towards accepting
bids which are not in conformity with the tender specifications, so far. The
writ petitioners in the third group, i.e. W.P.(C) 8568/2014 (hereafter called
“the Balwan Singh group”) seeks directions to the oil marketing companies
to reject the tenders submitted by the bidders quoting LPG tank trucks of 18
MT capacity attached with prime movers/trucks of 4018/4019 model
coupled with two axle trailer. In addition, they seek rejection of bids of two
tenderers who applied in the SC/ST quotas with certificates which were
more than a year old calculated from the date of the tender advertisement.
2.      Through a common advertisement, three the respondents, i.e.,
(hereafter called "the oil marketing companies" consisting of Indian Oil
Corporation Ltd ("IOCL"); Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) invited electronic bids for
transportation of bulk Liquefied Petroleum Gas ("LPG") by road. The
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                       Page 3

electronic bids (e-tenders) invited consisted a Two-Bid system from bona-
fide bidders, willing to quote rates fulfilling advertised conditions, i.e.:
1. Owning at least One Bulk LPG / PROPANE tank truck ("TT") as on
closing date of tender.
2. The age of the tank truck quoted being not more than 15 years as on
31.10.2014 from the date of first registration.
3. Tank Truck quoted possessing a valid license from Petroleum Explosives
Safety Organization (PESO) as on closing date of tender.
3.      The tender was advertised for Region/Zone wise requirements of the
Oil Marketing Companies; the interested bidders had to quote rate for the
Region / Zone as well as for each Company of their choice. Bidders had to
meet the minimum qualification criteria, of the tender to participate in the
process. However, induction of TTs was to be based on evaluation criteria of
the tender. Furthermore, bidders had to upload particulars of all TTs offered,
according to a prescribed format - in terms of Annexure-II at the time of
submission of the e-tender. The TTs had to lift (pick up) the product from
any or all of the sources of bulk LPG for transportation of bulk LPG by road
in tank trucks, from loading locations as mentioned in the tender ( Price bid
and technical bid ) to all bottling Plants/Customers ( Ex- MI / Delivered ) of
the Oil Marketing Companies as well as for stock transfer of Auto LPG from
supply sources to Bottling plants during the contract period. The contracts
were to be valid for three years with effect from 01.11.2014 and extendable
for two more years at the sole discretion of the Corporation(s) at the same
terms and conditions. The tender provided for a yearly escalation of 3.25 %
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                           Page 4

for the 4th year & 5th year on the non fuel component of the applicable rate
(maximum 50% of rate) with formula mentioned in clause No.33 of
Contract Agreement. The bidders offering single ready owned truck could
offer one proposed owned truck and bidders offering more than one ready
owned trucks could offer maximum two proposed owned trucks of licensed
capacity of minimum 17 MT and above except for specified sectors.
4.      Proprietorships, partnership firms as well as other juristic entities
could participate and submit bids. Furthermore, reservation was permitted in
favour of Scheduled Cast/Scheduled Tribe applicants. The condition with
respect to the specification of TTs, contained in Clause 11 of the General
Terms and Conditions, stated that:

Contentions of the Baroda group of Petitioners in W.P.(C) 8776/2014
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                          Page 7

5.      The Baroda group petitioners submitted their tenders and offered
three and two tank trucks respectively. Their tenders enclosed the necessary
documents, such as the Registration Certificates (RCs) issued by the
concerned Road Transport Officers (RTOs), stating: (i) MLW of 40.2 MT
with two axles; (ii) PESO license for 18 MT with ML not exceeding 40.2
MT, and (iii) mounted trucks for 35.2 MT. The Baroda group claims that
they discovered- from website of the oil marketing companies- on
29.11.2014 that their bids were disqualified, due to mismatch of licenses and
RTO registrations. This was because one of the oil marketing companies, i.e.
HPCL was of the opinion that there was a discrepancy between the RC and
the PESO certificate on the one hand and the mounted drawings of the
trucks on the other. The RC and PESO license provided for MLW of 40.2
MT and the mounted drawings provided for MLW of 35.2 MT. The Baroda
group petitioners were asked on 02.12.2014 by the HPCL to interact with
them at their offices for clarifications on the issue of disqualification. In this,
they had referred to some minutes of meeting of the oil marketing
companies. The Baroda group petitioners sought for copies of the minutes of
meeting. The petitioners also by their e-mail sought clarifications as to
whether they could furnish any documents for clarifications – a stand which
was not accepted by the oil marketing companies. In these circumstances,
the Baroda group state that since the document, i.e. the minutes of the
meeting of the oil marketing companies were not furnished, they sought for
it under the RTI Act. This application was, however, not accepted.
6.      In this background of circumstances, the Baroda group contends that
there is no requirement of synchrony or uniformity between the mounted
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                           Page 8

trucks and the TTs as long as the certificates issued by the PESO and the
licenses issued by the RTO are valid and legal. In this connection, it is
contended that no tender condition has been referred to in the report by the
HPCL, an oil marketing company, while rejecting the bid. It is argued that
since the petitioners are in possession of RC and mounted trucks endorsed
for 40.2 MT, the tank trucks are logically suitable for 35.2 MTs. In this
connection, the Baroda group petitioners also referred to the interpretation
adopted by the other companies - IOCL and BPCL where the difference
between the mounted trucks and the TT capacity (referred to as mismatch by
the HPCL) was overlooked as long as the PESO certificate and the RTO
license were subsisting, provided the RTO endorsement indicated
acceptance of such TTs. The Baroda group assert that such a position has
been adopted by the oil marketing companies with respect to alleged
mismatch for the first time in seven years during which such vehicles had
been consistently accepted and awarded LoI/contracts.
7.      Sh. Yashank Adhyaru, learned senior counsel argued that there is no
basis for the alleged mismatch, given that the tender conditions merely
referred to the licensed capacity of minimum MT and above, except for
specified sectors. It is submitted that neither the general terms and
conditions of the tender, nor the notice inviting the bidders to respond to the
e-tender, nor for that matter do any of the other tender documents and its
several annexures, refer to the specifications, alleged to be applicable. It was
submitted that the alleged mismatch between the prime mover and the trailer
is of no consequence considering that the prime mover is heavier, i.e. 40.2
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                         Page 9

MT whereas the trailer load is 35.2 MT. In reality, therefore, the TT could
not cater to anything more than what a 35.2 MT tanker capacity could.
8.      Sh. Yashank Adhyaru, learned senior counsel referred to the PESO
license issued to both the petitioners of the Baroda group as well as the
insurance documents and highlighted that the copy of the licenses of the
vehicles which are part of the record fully describe the TTs as follows:
              Weight laden              40200
              XXXXXX                    XXXXXX
              Tyre description          F – 10.00 x 20, 16 PR
                                        Rear – 10.00 x 20, 16 PR
              Axle weight               Front – 6000 kgs. Rear
                                        10200 Kgs
                                        Tandem 24,000 Kgs.
Learned senior counsel also relied upon the RC in the case of five tank
trucks to underline that they are duly endorsed and were valid as on the date
of the submission of the bids.     It was further submitted that all the
documents were duly verified by the concerned oil marketing companies
and in these circumstances, the rejection based on the interpretation of the
tender condition, i.e. that the RCs endorsed for GVW of 40.2 MT and
mounted drawings endorsed for GVW 35.2 MTs for the “TTs with 2 axle
trailer but MLW as per form IV – PESO certificate is 40.2 MT” was utterly
unwarranted. These were determined as mismatch and were rejected on the
basis of the minutes of meeting dated 11.11.2014. The learned senior
counsel contended that this criteria was never notified in the advertisement.
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                       Page 10

Referring to the minutes of the meeting dated 11.11.2014, which was in turn
relied upon by the HPCL (the oil marketing company) in the rejection note,
it was submitted that, alternatively, even the narrow interpretation given to
the minutes of the said meeting was also not justified.
9.      Sh. Adhyaru, learned senior counsel submitted that since the minutes
of meeting of the oil marketing companies was silent and no clarification
issued thereafter, fairness demanded that all the bidders who had
furnished/submitted their bids - but without the necessary endorsement of
the RTOs concerned, ought to have been provided an opportunity to obtain
the same and thereafter consider the tenders on the basis of the
endorsements made. The relevant extracts of the minutes of the meeting
which clarified the basis for assessing the bids, provided as follows in regard
to the different models of trucks:

10.     It is argued on behalf of the Baroda group that the oil marketing
companies’ imposition of superfluous and subsequently thought-out criteria
is a colourable exercise of discretion and power. Asserting that so called
“mismatch” was never thought-out as a disqualifying factor in the tender
notice or the essential conditions spelt out with it, learned senior counsel
submitted that the oil marketing companies could not unilaterally, in the
guise of bringing interpretive uniformity, impose new conditions. It was
further stressed that whilst the reading of the minutes of meeting dated
11.11.2014 itself underlines that there is nothing inherently illegal or
unacceptable in regard to the allegedly mismatch between the prime movers
and the trailers as long as the PESO certificate and the RTO endorsement
with respect to that condition, i.e. the mismatch is furnished, it was argued
that, therefore, the insistence on a newly created condition amounts to
hostilely discriminating those who never had the occasion to secure such
documents on the one hand, and favourably treat those who managed to
secure it beforehand and submit it with their tender bids, on the other.
Learned counsel also referred to a letter issued by the Deputy Chief
Controller of Explosives (West Circle) dated 28.10.2014 as well as the
certificate issued in respect of the vehicles (i.e. 40200 mover with 35200 kg.
capacity trailer 2 axle trailer) by the Automotive Research Association of
India (ARAI). It was submitted that in these circumstances, the rejection of
the Baroda group’s position is both arbitrary and unfair. Counsel lastly
relied on the decision in M.R. Shah Logistics Pvt. Ltd v Indian Oil
Corporation Ltd (W.P.(C) 7957/2012 and a connected writ petition, decided
by a Division Bench of this Court on 26.07.2013) to say that change of the
vehicle specifications is not considered an essential deviation, as long as the
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                       Page 13

license and registration conditions are met with, so as to empower the oil
company to reject the tender altogether.
Contentions of the Malik Group (W.P.(C) 8435/2014) & the Balwan Singh
group (W.P.(C) 8568/2014)
11.     The Malik and Balwan Singh groups in their petitions as well as
through the submissions of their senior counsel - M/s. Sandeep Sethi and
A.K. Singla submit that the rejection of the Baroda group’s bids was a
necessary consequence of the correct interpretation of the tender conditions
and specifications. It was also submitted that to the extent the minutes of
meeting of 11.11.2014 dilute the tender specifications, they are contrary to
law. In support of this argument, this second group of petitioners – the Malik
and Balwan Singh groups firstly seek to highlight the malpractices whereby
the PESO issued licenses for 600 TTs whereas, in reality, a fraction of them
are manufacturing the corresponding TTs. It was argued consequently- and
more substantially - that LPG is carried in a specifically designed vessel
known as SMPV (Static and Mobile Pressure Vessels) governed by the
Static and Mobile Pressure Vesses (Unfired) Rules, 1981. Such TTs consist
of two main body parts – the prime mover and the trailer. Though they are
different constituents, they are treated as part of one unit. The gross vehicle
weight of TTs, it is contended, is governed by the statutory notification
under Section 58(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act (hereafter referred to as “the
Act”) dated 18.10.1996. It is stressed here that in terms of the notification,
where the prime mover is of 3516/3518 chassis model, it can be coupled
with two/double axle trailer. Likewise, where a prime mover is 4018/4019
chassis model, it can be coupled only with a suitable triple/three axle trailer.
It is submitted that manufacturers of such TTs, i.e. Tata and Ashok Leyland
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                       Page 14

first seek approval of the ARAI, certifying that their vehicles comply with
the Motor Vehicle Act and Rules and after such certifications they approach
the concerned RTO for registration of the vehicle.
12.     The second group of petitioners alluded to a previous writ petition, i.e.
W.P.(C) 17451/2005 which was a public interest litigation that highlighted
the misuse of the forged or fictitious RCs based upon which PESO licenses
were obtained and sought to be used to obtain Letters of Intent from the oil
marketing companies. It is contended that as a consequence of the
undertaking recorded by this Court on 08.08.2007 that firm contracts would
not be issued and only LoI work permits would be first issued to enable the
forwarding of documents requiring verification from the concerned agencies
and only thereafter work orders would be issued, was the practice of issuing
LoIs initiated.
13.     The provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, particularly Sections 52 and
58 are relied upon by M/s. Sandeep Sethi and A.K. Singla, to say that any
changes not only have to be in conformity with the notified specifications
for vehicles, to be considered permissible ones- but that every change has to
be endorsed and duly accepted by the concerned RTO in the absence of
which, the motor vehicles itself fall within the forbidden category,
prohibited from plying on the roads. In this connection, the notification
dated 18.10.1996 issued in respect of the maximum GVW was relied on by
both these petitioners. The said notification reads as follows:

14.     It was lastly argued that by reason of Section 52 of the Act,
alternations which involve change in the structure of the vehicle and the
resulting change in its basic feature cannot be effected without approval of
the Central Government. Any consequential changes such as alteration in the
seating capacity – subject to parameters of Chapter V etc. only can be
undertaken. It is urged that given the specific phraseology of Section 52, any
permissible alterations which are not specifically mentioned and which is
contrary to terms of notifications under Section 58(1) have to receive
express approval. It was, therefore, urged that the minutes of the meeting to
the extent they clarified the acceptance of vehicles that are not authorized to
ply on the road, is illegal.
Stand of the Official Respondents- the Oil Marketing Companies
15.     The position adopted by the oil marketing companies – the BPCL and
IOCL - in a joint reply filed in the Baroda group writ petition disclose the
estimated/undertaken requirement of the number of TTs of the oil marketing
companies and further relied upon the eligibility criteria prescribed for the
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                        Page 18

TTs. They also stated that the credential bids were opened on 24.09.2014
and the process of price bid evaluation is underway. It is urged that since the
tenders are being finalized on a common basis for all regions, common
issues cropped-up which needed clarifications. As a result, the meeting was
held on 11.11.2014 where it was particularly decided upon the common
approach to be adopted in the evaluation exercise. It was in these
circumstances that the relevant clarification No.12 was issued. The oil
marketing companies in their affidavit state that they would be evaluating
TTs offered by the bidders and where the model of the TT is
4018/4019/4021, its GVW is recorded in the RC as 40.2 MT and the
explosive license records GVW/MLW as 35.2 MT and not as 40.2 MT, the
same would be rejected unless the RC with respect to the revised GVW as
recorded in the explosive license is endorsed. It is because of this that this
position was taken since the RC is issued by the RTO and the explosive
licence is issued by PESO and they form the bids’ basic documents on
which the eligibility of a TT is premised. The oil marketing companies
assert that whether the registering authority or the explosive department
issues a written certificate is neither within their domain, nor they are
qualified to make such an enquiry.
16.     The counter affidavit and reply of the HPCL interestingly in its most
part supports the arguments of the second group of the petitioners and
heavily relies upon the notification dated 18.10.1996. It is submitted that the
variance in specification of TTs from the description mentioned in the RC
makes it incompatible with the tender specifications, which strikes at the
very root of the validity of the RC. The HPCL relies upon a clarification
issued by the Additional Transport Commissioner, Maharashtra Circle to the
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                       Page 19

The HPCL highlights that the tender conditions unequivocally require that
the vehicle offered at all times should be in conformity with the provisions
of the Motor Vehicles Act.
Analysis & Conclusions
Provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act
17.     Section 52 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which was cited during the
submissions, reads as follows1:
        1
          Old Section 52 was substituted by Act 27 of 2000, S.2 (w.e.f. 11-8-2000). Prior to its substitution,
        Section 52 read as under :-
        “52. Alternation in motor vehicle .- (1) No owner of a motor vehicle shall so alter the vehicle that the
        particulars contained in the certificate of registration are no longer accurate, unless.-
        (a) he has given notice to the registering authority within whose jurisdiction he has the residence or
        the place of business where the vehicle is normally kept, as the case may be of the alteration he
        proposes to make; and
        (b) he has obtained the approval of that registering authority to make such alteration :
        Provided that it shall not be necessary to obtain such approval for making any change in the unladen
        weight of the motor vehicle consequent on the addition or removal of fittings or accessories, if such
        change does not exceed two per cent. of the weight entered in the certificate of registration :
        *[Provided further that modification of the engine, or any part thereof, of a vehicle forfacilitating its
        operation by a different type of fuel or source of energy including battery, compressed natural gas,
        solar power or any other fuel or source of energy other than liquid petroleum gas shall be treated as
        an alteration but that shall be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.]

        “52. Alteration in motor vehicle. - (1) No owner of a motor
        vehicle shall so alter the vehicle that the particulars contained
        in the certificate of registration are at variance with those
        originally specified by the manufacturer :
        Provided that where the owner of a motor vehicle makes
        modification of the engine, or any part thereof of a vehicle for
        facilitating its operation by different type of fuel or source of
        energy including battery, compressed natural gas, solar power,
        liquid petroleum gas or any other fuel or source of energy, by
        fitment of a conversion kit, such modification shall be carried out
        subject to such conditions as may be prescribed:
        Provided further that the Central Government may prescribe
        specifications, conditions for approval, retro fitment and other
        related matters for such conversion kits;
        Provided also that the Central Government may grant exemption
        for alteration of vehicles in a manner other than specified above,
        for any specific purpose.
        (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), a
        State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette,
        authorise, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the
        notifications, and permit any person owing not less than ten
        transport vehicles to alter any vehicle owned by him so as to
        replace the engine thereof with engine of the same make and
        type, without the approval of registering authority.
        (3) Where any alteration has been made in motor vehicle without
        the approval of registering authority or by reason of replacement
        of its engine without such approval under sub-section (2), the
        owner of the vehicle shall, within fourteen days of the making of
        the alteration, report the alteration to the registering authority
        within whose jurisdiction he resides and shall forward the
        certificate of registration to that authority together with the
        prescribed fee in order that particulars of registration may be
        entered therein.
        (4) A registering authority other than the original registering
        authority making any such entry shall communicate the details of
        the entry to the original registering authority.
        (5) Subject to the provisions made under sub-section (1), (2), (3)
        and (4), no person holding a vehicle under a hire-purchase

        agreement shall make any alteration to the vehicle except with
        the written consent of the registered owner.
        Explanation. - For the purpose of this section, “alteration”
        means a change in the structure of a vehicle which results in
        change in its basic feature.]
18.     Section 58 reads as follows:
        “58. Special provisions in regard to transport vehicles. – (1) The
        Central Government may, having regard to the number, nature
        and size of the tyres attached to the wheels of a transport vehicle
        (other than a motorcab), and its make and model and other
        relevant considerations, by notification in the Official Gazette,
        specify, in relation to each make and model of a transport
        vehicle, the [maximum gross vehicle weight] of such vehicle and
        the maximum safe axle weight of each axle of such vehicle.
        (2) A registering authority, when registering a transport vehicle,
        other than a motor cab shall enter in the record of registration
        and shall also enter in the certificate of registration of the
        vehicle the following particulars, namely :-
        (a) the unladen weight of the vehicle;
        (b) the number, nature and size of the tyres attached to each
        wheel;
        (c) the gross weight of the vehicle and the registered axle weights
        pertaining to the several axles thereof; and
        (d) if the vehicle is used or adapted to be used for the carriage of
        passengers solely or in addition to goods, the number of
        passengers for whom accommodation is provided, and the owner
        of the vehicle shall have the same particulars exhibited in the
        prescribed manner on the vehicle.
        (3) There shall not be entered in the certificate of registration of
        any such vehicle any gross vehicle weight or a registered axle
        weight of any of the axles different from that specified in the
        notification under sub-section (1) in relation to the make and
        model of such vehicle and to the number, nature and size of the
        tyres attached to its wheels :
        Provided that where it appears to the Central Government that
        heavier weights than those specified in the notification under
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                         Page 23

        sub-section (1) may be permitted in a particular locality for
        vehicle of a particular type, the Central Government may, by
        order in the Official Gazette direct that the provisions of this
        sub-section shall apply with such modifications as may be
        specified in the order.
        2
        (5) In order that the gross vehicle weight entered in the
        certificate of registration of a vehicle may be revised in
        accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), the registering
        authority may require the owner of transport vehicle in
        accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed to
        produce the certificate of registration within such time as may be
        specified by the registering authority.”
The objects and reasons for this provision (Clause 57 of the Bill as it
originally stood) provided that this was to “specify in relation to each make
and model of a transport vehicle the maximum safe laden weight and the
maximum safe axle weight of each such vehicle”; and further that “the
registering authorities while registering a transport vehicle shall make a
note of the unladen weight, and gross vehicle weight and such other
particulars in the registration certificate of the vehicle and other such
particulars in the registration certificate…”
19.     Section 52 enacts, therefore, a general prohibition against the owners
and pliers of motor vehicles- with few well defined exceptions- from
2
  Act 27 of 2000, by S.3 omitted Sub section (4) w.e.f. 11-8-2000. Prior to its
omission, sub-Section (4) read as under :-
        “(4) When by reason of any alteration in such vehicle, including an
        alteration in the number, nature or size of its tyres, the gross vehicle weight
        of the vehicle or the registered axle weight of any of its axles no longer
        accords with the provisions of sub-section (3), the provisions of section 52
        shall apply and the registering authority shall enter in the certificate of
        registration of the vehicle revised registered weights which accord with the
        said sub-section.”
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                                    Page 24

changing or altering the basic character of a vehicle. Section 58 (1) deals
with special provisions in respect to transport vehicles. Parliament here
empowered only the Central Government to specify, through a notification,
“in relation to each make and model of a transport vehicle, the [maximum
gross vehicle weight] of such vehicle and the maximum safe axle weight of
each axle of such vehicle…” Section 58 (2) enjoins every registering
authority to enter certain details, viz (a) the unladen weight of the vehicle;
(b) the number, nature and size of the tyres attached to each wheel; (c) the
gross weight of the vehicle and the registered axle weights pertaining to the
several axles thereof; and (d) if the vehicle is used or adapted to be used for
the carriage of passengers solely or in addition to goods, the number of
passengers for whom accommodation is provided, and the owner of the
vehicle shall have the same particulars exhibited in the prescribed manner on
the vehicle. Section 58 (3) importantly directs that no registration certificate
of a vehicle can reflect “any gross vehicle weight or a registered axle weight
of any of the axles different from that specified in the notification under sub-
section (1) in relation to the make and model of such vehicle and to the
number, nature and size of the tyres attached to its wheels..” The proviso to
this sub-section authorizes the Central Government to relieve this condition
only “in a particular locality for vehicle of a particular type, the Central
Government may, by order in the Official Gazette direct that the provisions
of this sub-section shall apply with such modifications as may be specified in
the order.”
20.     It is thus apparent that what Parliament intended by enacting Section
58 (1) and (3) was to ensure uniformity in regard to the standards which
every transport vehicle had to conform. Section 58 (1) enabled the
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                         Page 25

prescription of criteria. This means that only one authority, i.e. the Central
Government alone, is empowered to notify what should be “maximum gross
vehicle weight of such vehicle and the maximum safe axle weight of each
axle of such vehicle” in respect of transport vehicles. Section 58 (2) obliges
every registering authority to effectuate the mandate of Section 58 (1) by
describing the relevant particulars, i.e. unladen weight of the vehicle; the
number, nature and size of the tyres attached to each wheel; the gross weight
of the vehicle and the registered axle weights relating to the several axles
thereof; and whether the vehicle is used or adapted to be used for the
carriage of passengers solely or in addition to goods. Section 58 (3) enacts
what is implicit in Section 58 (1)- that the standards spelt out only and none
other than those, can be adhered to in respect of “the number, nature and
size of the tyres attached to its wheels..” Section 58 (3) proviso carves out
an exception to its applicability to the extent the Central Government
specifies in relation to a particular region.
21.     Section 52 talks generally of the kind of alterations which a vehicle
can undergo; some can be undertaken without intimation or approval of the
registering authority; in the case of others, however, approval of the
registering authority is required. Section 52 (1) however, specifically states
that “No owner of a motor vehicle shall so          alter the vehicle that the
particulars contained in the certificate of registration are at variance with
those originally specified by the manufacturer”. The exceptions which are
permissible in succeeding provisions- Section 52 (1) and its proviso, Section
52 (3), relate to alterations which make the vehicle more fuel efficient and
environmentally friendly, as well as pertain to replacement of engines, etc.
Barring these changes, every alteration is impermissible; what is an
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                       Page 26

alteration is defined in Explanation below Section 52: ““alteration” means
a change in the structure of a vehicle which results in change in its basic
feature.”
22.     A collective reading of Sections 52 and 58 would lead one to
conclude that firstly, alterations, which result in change of a basic feature of
the vehicle are prohibited. Secondly, such changes which result in fuel
efficiency, if they conform to specific standards, are permissible: the
condition being that the registering authority has to be notified. Thirdly,
Section 58 (1) requires the prescription of standards to be followed by every
transport vehicle, especially with regard to maximum axle weight having
regard to the number of wheels it has. The mandatory nature of this
provision is emphasized by Section 58 (3) which states that there cannot be
variance (of a vehicle) with respect to “the make and model of such vehicle
and to the number, nature and size of the tyres attached to its wheels..”
23.     The notification spelling out the safe standards for “semi-articulated”
transport vehicles of the kind which are in question here, provide, inter alia,
that:
        “….the Central Government hereby specifies that in relation to
        the transport vehicles (other than motor cabs) of various
        categories detailed in the Schedule below the maximum gross
        vehicle weight and the maximum safe axle weight of each axle of
        such vehicles shall, having regard to the size, nature and number
        of tyres and maximum weight permitted to be carried by the tyres
        as per rule 95 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules,1989, be-

        weight put together subject to the restrictions, if any, on the
        maximum gross vehicle weight given in the said schedule.

It is thus clear that as a matter of law, the safety standard required of each
transport vehicle which describes itself as a semi articulated vehicle,
comprised of two constituent parts, i.e. the prime mover and the tractor
trailer, is that for a 40.2 MT vehicle, two axle front prime mover with 6
tonnes on front axle and 10.2 tonnes on rear axle; and 24 tonnes on 3 axles
for the trailer (12 tyres on those 3 axles) is mandated.
24.     In the present case, the IOCL and the BPCL, the two oil marketing
companies rely on the minutes of meeting dated 11.11.2014 to say that so
long as the PESO license and the registration are shown, any change in the
vehicle description which varies from the manufacturer’s description can be
accepted, provided the concerned RTO endorses the registration certificate.
Their further position is that such endorsement should have been obtained
before the date of submission of the application form. Now, as discussed in
this judgment, Section 58 is unrelenting as to the requirement which every
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                      Page 29

transport vehicle has to conform to, especially as regards maximum weight,
number of axles and tyres. These are in no manner relieved in their
application – except by a statutory notification of equal authority, i.e. by the
Central Government, under proviso to Section 58 (1). However, no such
notification exists in relation to the class of vehicles which the present case
is concerned with. (Here the court is not expressing any opinion on the
requirement of another category of transport vehicles for the eastern region,
for which a lesser tonnage has been spelt out). Therefore, the petitioners of
the second group- i.e. the Malik and the Balwan Singh group are correct in
contending that the oil marketing companies could not have sought to dilute
the standards spelt out in the 1996 notification. The oil marketing companies
are concededly neither the Central Government nor even the registering
authority. In this connection, the guidance and advice provided by the
Additional Transport Commissioner, Maharastra to the Chief Commissioner
of Explosives on 28th October, 2014 is also in line with the conclusions of
this Court. That letter had pertinently said that:
        “.. if the operator who are using the tractor of 40200 kgs. with 2
        axle trailers and whose GVW is noted as 40200 kgs. in the
        vehicle registration certificates are violating the provisions of
        MV Act, 1988, such kind of tractors are required to be provided
        with 3 axle semi trailer.
                 You are requested not to certify these tractors whose GVW
        is noted as 40200 kgs. in the registration certificates and fitted
        with 2 axle trailer. You are also requested to send these
        operators back to Registering Authorities for verification of
        records.”
25.     As to the contention of the Baroda group that the tender conditions
and specifications nowhere spelt out the details in regard to the number of
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                        Page 30

axles which were to be on different categories of TTs are concerned, the
Court is of the opinion that this argument is fallacious. Firstly, Clause 11 of
the General terms and conditions governing the tender specified that:
        “The tank trucks offered against this tender should conform to
        the specification mentioned in Motor Vehicles Act, as applicable
        from time to time and be equipped to transport bulk LPG and
        should conform to the following:”
Secondly, arguendo, even in the absence of the above specification, the
imperative nature of Section 58 (1) and 58 (3) allow any exceptions, when a
notification (read the 1996 notification) stipulates specifications. The
contentions of the Baroda group regarding arbitrariness and discrimination,
therefore, are unpersuasive. There can be no two opinions that tender
conditions bind both the state agency which invites bids for goods and
services, as well as the potential supplier of those goods and services, i.e. the
tenderer/bidder. (Ref G.J. Fernandez vs State Of Karnataka & Ors AIR
1990 SC 958; State of NCT of Delhi and Another v. Sanjeev alias Bittoo
(2005) 5 SCC 181). As to what should be the approach of courts in dealing
with challenges to tender conditions and their applications, under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, Jagdish Mandal vs. State of Orissa & Ors,
a decision of the Supreme Court (reported as (2007) 14 SCC 517) spelt out
the relevant considerations which weigh in such judicial review:
        “22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to
        prevent arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and
        mala fides. Its purpose is to check whether choice or decision is
        made “lawfully” and not to check whether choice or decision is
        “sound”. When the power of judicial review is invoked in
        matters relating to tenders or award of contracts, certain special
        features should be borne in mind. A contract is a commercial
        transaction. Evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                        Page 31

        essentially commercial functions. Principles of equity and
        natural justice stay at a distance. If the decision relating to
        award of contract is bona fide and is in public interest, courts
        will not, in exercise of power of judicial review, interfere even if
        a procedural aberration or error in assessment or prejudice to a
        tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial review will not be
        permitted to be invoked to protect private interest at the cost of
        public interest, or to decide contractual disputes. The tenderer or
        contractor with a grievance can always seek damages in a civil
        court. Attempts by unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary
        grievances, wounded pride and business rivalry, to make
        mountains out of molehills of some technical/procedural
        violation or some prejudice to self, and persuade courts to
        interfere by exercising power of judicial review, should be
        resisted. Such interferences, either interim or final, may hold up
        public works for years, or delay relief and succour to thousands
        and millions and may increase the project cost manifold.
        Therefore, a court before interfering in tender or contractual
        matters in exercise of power of judicial review, should pose to
        itself the following questions:
        (i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the
        authority is mala fide or intended to favour someone;
        OR Whether the process adopted or decision made is so
        arbitrary and irrational that the court can say: “the decision is
        such that no responsible authority acting reasonably and in
        accordance withrelevant law could have reached?”;
        (ii) Whether public interest is affected.
        If the answers are in the negative, there should be no
        interference under Article 226.”
The Court again recollects a later judgment of the Supreme Court in
Michigan Rubber (India) Limited Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors 2012 (8)
SCC 216. The court had then re-visited its previous rulings on the nature of
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                         Page 32

judicial review in respect of contractual matters of the State or its agencies
and concluded as follows:
        “23. From the above decisions, the following principles emerge:
        (a) the basic requirement of Article 14 is fairness in action by the
        State, and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the
        heartbeat of fair play. These actions are amenable to the judicial
        review only to the extent that the State must act validly for a
        discernible reason and not whimsically for any ulterior purpose.
        If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be
        legitimate to take into consideration the national priorities;
        (b) fixation of a value of the tender is entirely within the purview
        of the executive and courts hardly have any role to play in this
        process except for striking down such action of the executive as
        is proved to be arbitrary or unreasonable. If the Government
        acts in conformity with certain healthy standards and norms such
        as awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in those
        circumstances, the interference by Courts is very limited;
        (c) In the matter of formulating conditions of a tender document
        and awarding a contract, greater latitude is required to be
        conceded to the State authorities unless the action of tendering
        authority is found to be malicious and a misuse of its statutory
        powers, interference by Courts is not warranted;
        (d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders have to be
        laid down to ensure that the contractor has the capacity and the
        resources to successfully execute the work; and
        (e) If the State or its instrumentalities act reasonably, fairly and
        in public interest in awarding contract, here again, interference
        by Court is very restrictive since no person can claim
        fundamental right to carry on business with the Government.
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                         Page 33

        24. Therefore, a Court before interfering in tender or contractual
        matters, in exercise of power of judicial review, should pose to
        itself the following questions:
        (i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the
        authority is mala fide or intended to favour someone; or whether
        the process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and
        irrational that the court can say: "the decision is such that no
        responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with
        relevant law could have reached"; and (ii) Whether the public
        interest is affected. If the answers to the above questions are in
        negative, then there should be no interference under Article
        226.”
The last contention of the Baroda group, based on the decision of the
Division Bench, in Shah Logistics (supra) is unmerited. In that case, the
chassis of the vehicle had to be changed; this necessitated its inspection by
the Controller of Explosives, who certified that the changed chassis also met
with the specifications. This post tender development was duly notified to
the oil company, which did not take the position at that time that the change
could not have been effected. The Court held that at the time the bid was
entered, there was no dispute that it complied with all specifications and that
the subsequent change, duly intimated was not of such consequence as to
undermine the essential basis of the bid; the Court then interpreted Clause
11 (b) of the Tender documents. Here, that is not the situation; the Baroda
group is stating that the insistence that the offer of the bidder should comply
with legal requirements, spelt out in the 1996 notification, is a post tender
condition. As explained and held earlier, this is based on an inaccurate
reading of the tender conditions.
26.     That leaves the court to consider one of the contentions advanced by
the Balwan Singh group with respect to acceptance of tenders of bidders in
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                        Page 34

the SC/ST categories; the complaint was that in regard to this group,
contrary to the tender conditions, which required the certificates to have
been issued within a year from the last date of submission of tenders, the oil
marketing companies were accepting bids with certificates obtained earlier.
This, in the opinion of the court cannot be termed as an illegality or
irregularity of such magnitude as to be characterized as arbitrary or “so
unreasonable that no reasonable man could have taken such a decision”. The
object of ensuring submission of such certificates is to monitor whether the
applicant is indeed falling in such SC/ST category. It cannot be overlooked
or even overemphasized that the purpose of providing such reservation is to
ensure that State largesse is distributed to those deserving it and in the
process all sections of the society are given it. Here, the SC/ST caste status
are in the nature of certification of their status which does not vary with
time. Therefore the approach of the oil marketing companies is not arbitrary
or discriminatory.
27.     In view of the above conclusions, the writ petitions of the Baroda
group W.P.(C) 8776/2014- fail. The other two writ petitions succeed in part
to the extent that the respondent oil marketing companies are hereby
directed to ensure that only those TTs which confirm strictly to the legal
standards spelt out in the relevant notification (No. SO 728(E) dated
18.10.1996) are processed and awarded Letters of Intent (LoIs), in the tender
process and all TTS which do not conform to such technical standards, are
not awarded LoIs. The writ petitions W.P.(C) 8435/2014 and W.P.(C)
W.P.(C) 8776/14, 8568/14 & 8435/14                                      Page 35

8568/2014 are partially allowed only to the extent and in terms of, such
directions. There shall be no order as to costs.
