                              B E F O R E
 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUP KUMAR GOSWAMI
For the petitioner                        : Mr. D. Borah, Advocate.
For respondents                           : Ms. A. Dass, Central Government Counsel.
Date of hearing & Judgment & Order        : 25th July, 2017.
                      JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
          Heard Mr. D. Borah, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Ms. A.
Dass, learned Central Government counsel, appearing for all the respondents.
WP(C) No.2213/2016                                                       Page 1 of 7

2.         While the petitioner was serving as Superintending Engineer (Civil) in HQ-
763 BRTF (GREF) Project Vartak, on the ground of possessing hard cash of
Rs.15,03,000/-, which was considered to be disproportionate to the known sources
of income of the petitioner, investigation was carried out by the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI), Guwahati and in connection with the said investigation, the
petitioner was detained under the custody of CBI w.e.f. 20.03.2013 for a period
exceeding 48(forty-eight) ours and resultantly, the under Secretary to the
Government of India passed an order dated 05.04.2013 recording that the petitioner
was deemed to have been suspended w.e.f. the date of detention, i.e. 20.03.2013,
in terms of Sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Central Civil Service (Classification, Control &
Appeal) Rules, 1965 [for short, “CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965”].
3.         The order of suspension was continued by an order dated 03.09.2013 and
challenging the said order dated 03.09.2013, the petitioner had earlier approached
this Court by filing a writ petition being WP(C) No.2170/2014. The said writ petition
was disposed of by an order dated 03.06.2015.
4.         Perusal of the said order dated 03.06.2015 goes to show that though the
petitioner had made number of prayers in the said writ petition, save and except the
legality and validity of the order dated 03.09.2013, other prayers were not pressed.
5.         Holding that the respondents did not review the order of suspension within
180(one hundred eighty) days, relying on a judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of Union of India -Vs- Dipak Mali, reported in (2010) 2 SCC 222 and the
provisions contained in Rule 10 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965, order dated
03.09.2013 and also the subsequent order of extension of suspension dated
24.12.2013 were set aside with a direction to the respondents to reinstate the
petitioner into service w.e.f. 18.06.2013 within a period of 1(one) month from the
date of receipt of a certified copy of the said order. Direction was also issued to the
respondents to take a decision with regard to the treating of the period of
suspension of the petitioner beyond 17.06.2013 till the date of his reinstatement as
per law within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of the order. The petitioner submitted a representation on 12.06.2015 along with a
WP(C) No.2213/2016                                                        Page 2 of 7

copy of the aforesaid order dated 03.06.2015 of this Court passed in WP(C)
No.2170/2014.
6.        As the petitioner was not reinstated in service, alleging wilful and
deliberate violation of the order of this Court dated 03.06.2015 passed in WP(C)
No.2170/2014, the petitioner approached this Court in contempt jurisdiction by filing
a contempt case, which was registered as Cont. Case (C) No.594/2015.               The
incumbents holding the posts of the Secretary, Boarder Roads Development Board
and the Director General, Boarder Roads Organization were the opposite parties in
the said contempt application.
7.        Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India had appeared in
the said contempt case. The contempt petition was closed taking note of the
submissions of Mr. Keyal.     It will be appropriate to reproduce herein below the
relevant portion of the order dated 28.09.2015, by which the contempt case was
closed. The order reads as follows:-
                    “Mr Keyal, learned Assistant Solicitor General submits that Under
          Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Defence, Border Roads
          Organization, Government of India has passed an order dated 24.08.2015,
          revoking the order of suspension w.e.f. 18.06.2013. He has further made a
          submission before the Court that legal consequence of this order would be
          that the period of suspension of the petitioner would stand regularized and
          he would be entitled to the salary due for the said period minus any
          subsistence allowance paid for the said period.
                    Submissions made by Mr Keyal, learned Assistant Solicitor
          General has been taken note of.
                    In view of the above, Court is of the view that order of this Court
          has been complied with.
                    Accordingly, contempt petition stands closed.”
8.        The order dated 24.08.2015, which finds mention in the order dated
28.09.2015 reads as follows:-
WP(C) No.2213/2016                                                       Page 3 of 7

                                       “ORDER
                    WHEREAS, an order placing Shri Ram Milan, SE (Civ) (GO
          No.2092W) under suspension was made by the President on 05/04/2013.
          2.   NOW, THEREFORE, the President in pursuance of Judgment Order
          dated 03 June, 2015 delivered by Hon’ble High Court Guwahati in WP(C)
          No.2170/2014 and in exercise of powers conferred by Rule 10(5)(c) of the
          Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965,
          hereby revokes the said order of suspension with effect from 18/06/2013.”
9.        The petitioner had submitted another representation on 28.10.2015
[Annexure-P/13 (Colly)] contending that he is entitled to be treated to be on duty for
all purposes w.e.f. 18.06.2013 and that he would also be entitled to full pay and
allowances for the intervening period, i.e. from 18.06.2013 to 20.09.2015.
10.       Mr. Borah has submitted that the petitioner received his salary from
21.09.2015 onwards and, therefore, prayer was made for payment of salary from
18.06.2013 to 20.09.2015 in the said representation.
11.       On 21.01.2016, prayer made by the petitioner in the representation dated
28.10.2015 was rejected by the Under Secretary to the Government of India. The
order dated 21.01.2016, which is put to challenge in the writ petition, reads as
under:-
                                       “ORDER
          1.        WHEREAS, Shri Ram Milan, SE (Civ) (GO No.2092W), while
          functioning as Commander of 763 BRTF (Project) Vartak was arrested by
          CBI, ACB, Guwahati at Guwahati Railway Station with hard cash of
          Rs.15,03,000/- and detained under the custody of CBI Guwahati wef 20
          Mar 2013 for a period exceeding forty eight hours.
          2.        WHEREAS, Shri Ram Milan, SE (Civ) was deemed to have been
          suspended wef 20 Mar 2013 under the provisions of sub-rule (2) of Rule
          10 of the Central Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules,
          1965 vide Order No.BRDB/02(73)/2013/GE-II dated 05 Apr 2013.
WP(C) No.2213/2016                                                       Page 4 of 7

           3.        WHEREAS, the Competent Authority in pursuance of Hon’ble
           High Court of Guwahati Order dated 3.6.2015 in WP(C) No.2170/2014
           revoked suspension of Shri Ram Milan vide Order No.BRDB/02(73)/2013-
           GE-II dated 24 Aug 2013 and gave notice vide letter of even No. Dated
           5.11.2015 to Sh. Ram Milan calling his representation regarding Pay &
           Allowances.
           4.        WHEREAS, Shri Ram Milan vide his representation dated
           28.10.2015 has inter-alia stated that full payment wef 18.06.2013 to
           20.09.2015 may be made after adjusting subsistence allowance.
           5.        WHEREAS, the above said proposed amount under FR-54B is an
           ad-hoc arrangement, final decision on his pay & allowances during his
           suspension will be taken subject to outcome of CBI Court case No.RC
           4(A)/2013-GWH.
           6.        NOW, THEREFORE, the Competent Authority after considering
           the representation dated 28.10.2015 has ordered that:-
                (i) Not to treat the period of suspension w.e.f. 18.6.2013 to
                     23.8.2015 as on duty.
                (ii) The quantum of pay & allowances for the period wef 18.6.2013
                     to the date of revocation of suspension i.e. 23.8.2015 may be
                     treated equal to the payment of subsistence allowance already
                     paid to the Officer during period from 18.6.2013 to 23.8.2015.”
12.        It appears that subsequent to the passing of the order dated 21.01.2016,
the petitioner again filed a contempt case being Cont. Case (C) No.98/2016 and this
Court by an order dated 17.06.2016 closed the said contempt case giving liberty to
the petitioner to assail the legality and validity of the order dated 21.01.2016 in an
appropriate proceeding.
13.        In the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Joint Director (Administration) in
the present writ petition on behalf of the respondents, stand is taken that
WP(C) No.2213/2016                                                        Page 5 of 7

suspension of the petitioner was fully justified in view of the misconduct of the
petitioner and that the pay and allowances presently allowed to the petitioner is an
interim measure subject to final outcome of the CBI Court Case No.RC 4(A)/2013-
GWH pending against him.
14.        The short and precise submission of Mr. Borah is that subject matter of the
writ petition is not the pay and allowances that the petitioner will be entitled to
during the period of suspension from 20.03.2013 to 17.06.2013, which may be
subject to the outcome of the CBI case. He has articulated that the grievance of the
petitioner is the refusal of the respondents to reinstate the petitioner in gross
violation of the order of this Court for almost 2(two) years until the order dated
24.08.2015 was passed. He submits that the decision of the respondents not to treat
the period from 18.06.2013 to 23.08.2015 as on duty cannot be sustained under any
circumstances. As the petitioner had been unjustifiably deprived of discharging his
duties despite the order of this Court, he would be entitled to payment of full salary
and allowances, he submits.
15.        Abiding by the stand taken in the affidavit and the order dated 21.01.2016,
Ms. Dass has submitted that having regard to the misconduct of the petitioner, the
petitioner will not be entitled to pay and allowances for the period from 18.06.2013
to 23.08.2015.
16.        It is to be noted that the order dated 03.06.2015 passed in WP(C)
No.2170/2014 was not put to challenge by way of an appeal in any appellate forum.
The order of this Court dated 03.06.2015 passed in WP(C) No.2170/2014, as such,
had attained finality. In the order dated 21.06.2016, in Paragraph 6(i), the period
from 18.06.2013 to 23.08.2015 was considered to be a period of suspension. This
observation is, ex-facie, wrong, in view of the order of this Court dated 03.06.2015
passed in WP(C) No.2170/2014, whereby this Court had quashed the extension
orders dated 03.09.2014 and 24.12.2013 with a direction to reinstate the petitioner
within 1(one) month w.e.f. 18.06.2013. By not reinstating the petitioner within the
period, as aforesaid, w.e.f. 18.06.2013, the respondents had sought to overreach
the order of this Court, which is impermissible in law. The respondents had the
WP(C) No.2213/2016                                                       Page 6 of 7

liberty to assail the order of this Court dated 03.06.2015, but they cannot take law
into their hands and arbitrarily and unauthorisedly refuse to reinstate the petitioner
for almost 2(two) years. The petitioner cannot be penalised for dereliction and
arbitrary action on the part of the respondent authorities in not reinstating the
petitioner. In this context, it will also be relevant to note that the Assistant Solicitor
General of India had also conceded to the position as reflected in the order dated
28.09.2015 passed in Cont. Case (C) No.594/2015 that the legal consequence of the
order dated 24.08.2015 would be that the period of suspension of the petitioner
would stand regularised and that he would be entitled to salary due for the said
period minus subsistence allowance paid for the said period.
17.        In view of the above discussion, the decision of the respondents not to
treat the period from 18.06.2013 to 23.08.2015 as on duty, requires interference in
the interest of justice. Consequently, the order dated 21.01.2016 is interfered with
and it is ordered that the period from 18.06.2013 to 23.08.2015 shall be counted as
on duty and that the petitioner will be entitled to pay and allowances for the period
from 18.06.2013 to 23.08.2015. As the petitioner had been paid salary only from
21.09.2015, the petitioner shall also be paid his salary for the period from
24.08.2015 to 20.09.2015. Payment for the period from 18.06.2013 to 20.09.2015
shall be made within a period of 3(three) months from the date of receipt of a
certified copy of this judgment and order by the respondents.
18.        Needless to say, the amount of subsistence allowance paid to the
petitioner, shall necessarily be deducted while computing the pay and allowances to
be paid now in terms of this judgment and order.
19.        With the above observations and directions, the writ petition stands
allowed. No cost.
