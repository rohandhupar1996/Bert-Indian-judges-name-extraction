Reason:
                       1.   The Transfer Petition and the Special Leave

                                                 2
Petition arising out of similar facts and events
have been heard together and are being decided by
this common order. The background facts giving
rise to the transfer petition as well as Special
Leave Petition need to be noted first.
2.  The parties in both the cases being common
shall be hereinafter referred to as described in
the transfer petition. Janhit Manch and another
which had filed the PIL at the Bombay High Court
are referred to as petitioners whereas, Shri Ram
Urban Infrastructure Ltd.(SRUIL) is referred to
as  respondent  No.6  and  other respondents   are
referred to as described in transfer petition.
3.  The genesis of dispute is PIL No. 43 of 2012
filed by petitioners in the Bombay High Court.
In PIL No.43 of 2012, petitioners have questioned
the action of respondent    No. 3 in respect of
concessions granted for development of    various
buildings in the city of Mumbai i.e. concessions

                                                       3
granted   in   respect   of  development     of  various
buildings     which     consequently      enabled    the
developers    to   amass    additional     areas   under
various heads, such as refuge areas, passages,
flower   beds,   decks   etc.,  free   of   Floor  Space
Index (“FSI”). The case of the respondent No.6
was specifically mentioned and challenged. It was
pleaded    that    respondent     No.6    against    the
permitted FSI of 54715.196 sq. mtrs. had used
additional FSI of approximately 6355.58 sq. mtrs.
under the guise of various heads such as refuge
areas, passages, decks etc.
4.  The Bombay High Court vide its judgment dated
13.05.2013 decided the PIL No.43 of 2012. In its
judgment, the High Court held that the refuge
areas granted to respondent No.6 with respect to
the said building was in utter excess of norms.
Thus,   Municipal    Commissioner    was   directed   to
re­examine the issue of excess refuge area and to

                                                        4
re­issue    the    FSI.   Petitioners      filed   SLP(C)
No.20279 of 2013, challenging the judgment of the
High Court dated 13.05.2013.
5.   The   respondent      No.6    had     proceeded   to
construct a 56 storey building. Respondent No.6
also   proposed    to   construct    a   public   parking
lot(PPL)   of   three   Basements   +    Lower  ground  +
Stilt + 15 Floors. Stop Work Notice was issued by
Mumbai   Municipal    Corporation    on    14.12.2011  to
respondent No.6 to desist from continuing with
construction of public parking lot. The said Stop
Work Notice was challenged by respondent No.6 in
Bombay City Civil Court by L.C. Suit No.2942 of
2011.   After   judgment   of   the   High   Court  dated
13.05.2013, the respondent        No.6 approached     the
Municipal        Commissioner.         The      Municipal
Commissioner passed an order on 12.09.2013. The
Municipal Commissioner in his order observed that
(i) Refuge areas would be provided free of FSI

                                                       5
only to the extent of 4 per cent        of the built up
area it served in the said building; (ii) those
areas in excess of requirements would be counted
in FSI in accordance with National Building Code,
2005.
7.  Respondent No.6, aggrieved by the order dated
12.09.2013, filed a Writ Petition (c) No.2223 of
2013 before the Bombay High Court. The order of
Civil Court dated 16.05.2013 whereby Stop Work
Notice  was   set   aside,  was    also  challenged   by
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay in the
High Court by filing a First Appeal No.884 of
2015.
8.  The petitioners' SLP(C) No.20279 of 2013 was
finally heard, in which separate and dissenting
judgments   were   delivered    on   25.04.2014,   which
mandated   the  SLP   to  be   referred   to  a  larger
Bench.   The   petitioner    had   filed   another   PIL
No.133 of 2015, where certain amendments in DCR

                                                      6
were   challenged.    The   Writ   Petition  filed   by
respondent No.6 being Writ No.2223 of 2013 was
decided   on   22nd,  25th   and   27th  January   2016
alongwith First Appeal No.884 of 2015.
9.   Municipal Commissioner was directed to hear
the respondent No.6 and to decide what should be
the reasonable refuge area in the said building.
The   order  dated    12.09.2013    was  confirmed   in
parts. The SLP(C) No.20279 of 2013 was listed on
11.03.2016 on which date, the Three Judge Bench
disposed off    the SLP    holding that in view of
judgment of the High Court dated 22 nd, 25th and
27th, January 2016 no issue is alive, however, the
liberty was granted to make a mention for recall
of the order.
10. The judgment of Bombay High Court dated 22nd,
25th and 27th January, 2016 was challenged by the
respondent   No.6    before   this   court  in   SLP(C)
No.10704­05 of 2016. This Court on 29.04.2016 has

                                                         7
issued   a   notice    in    SLP   of   respondent   No.6,
however,    no   interim      order    was   passed.   The
petitioners     also     preferred      the    SLP(C)   CC
Nos.13527­13528 of 2016, challenging            the above
judgment of the Bombay High Court. Petitioners
also filed IA 6 of 2016 for recalling the Three
Judge Bench order dated 11.03.2016, contending
that    several       issues       remain     alive    for
adjudication.    After    the    order   of  Bombay   High
Court  dated    22nd,   25th   and   27th January,   2016,
respondent No.3 passed an order on 31.08.2016.
Respondent No.3 inter alia held that:
         “(a) The areas provided on the
         external peripheral face of the
         flat be allowed as refuge area;
          (b) The refuge areas at the
          inside    of    the     building     at
          entrances of flats shall not be
          considered as refuge area;
          (c) The four full floors shown
          as refuge will not be taken as
          refuge; and
          (d) The       structural       columns
          falling    in the above        decided

                                                    8
         refuge areas can be allowed free
         of FSI.”
11. The   order    dated    31.08.2016    passed   by
respondent No.3 was challenged by the petitioners
by filing PIL No.17 of 2017. High Court vide its
order dated 24.02.2017     directed the respondent
No.2 to file its affidavit in reply within three
weeks and not to     act upon the impugned order
dated    31.08.2016     till     the    next    date.
Subsequently, matter was taken by the Bombay High
Court for hearing on 17.03.2017. After hearing
the counsel for both the parties, an order was
passed by the Bombay High Court on 17.03.2017.
Para No.4 to 7 of the order are to the following
effect:
         “(4)Apparently,      the    subject
         matter of the present litigation
         is an order dated 31.08.2016 at
         “Exhibit C” (page 58) which is
         the   order   of    the   Municipal
         Commissioner of Greater Mumbai
         in pursuance of the directions
         of this Court dated 27.01.2016

                                     9
in Writ Petition (c) No. 2223 of
2013.
(5) Challenging the orders in
Writ Petition (c) No.2223 of
2013, both the parties i.e. the
petitioners and respondent No. 6
have    filed      Special     Leave
Petitions.      The     petitioners
before us have filed Special
Leave Petition No.13527 of 2016,
and respondent No.6 has filed
Special Leave Petition Nos.10704
to 10705 of 2006. Admittedly no
interim orders are issued in the
above   SLPs    before   the    Apex
Court. Meanwhile, in pursuance
of   the   directions     in    Writ
Petition (c) No.2223 of 2013,
the Commissioner has passed an
order dated 31.08.2016 which is
the    subject­matter      of    the
present      Public         Interest
Litigation.    Since   the    larger
issues are pending before the
Apex Court pertaining to the
very same alleged illegalities
committed by respondent No.6 so
far as the property in question,
both the parties are in ad idem
with the submission that the
impugned      order      of      the
Commissioner     dated   31.08.2016
also can be challenged before
the Apex Court since that will
put an end to the controversy
between the parties once for
all.

                                                        10
         6. In that view of the matter,
         the parties are at liberty to
         approach the Apex Court with
         necessary        application        for
         transferring the present Public
         Interest Litigation also to be
         tagged    alongwith     the    Special
         Leave Petitions pending before
         the Apex Court.
         7. In     order     to   enable     the
         parties    to     take    appropriate
         course    of    action    as    stated
         above, we continue the interim
         order dated 24.02.2017 for a
         period of four weeks.”
12. In view of the order of the Bombay High Court
dated 17.03.2017, the Transfer Petition has been
filed by the petitioners in this Court.
13. SLP(C)   Nos.11749­11750      of   2017   have   been
filed by respondent No.6, questioning the interim
order  passed   by   the   Bombay    High   Court   dated
24.02.2017 and 17.03.2017 in PIL No.17 of 2017.
14. We  have   heard   Shri    Mukul   Rohatgi,    senior
counsel appearing for the petitioners and Shri
Kapil   Sibal,    senior     counsel    appearing     for

                                                        11
respondent No.6. Shri Mukul Rohatgi contends that
the judgments of the Bombay High Court dated 22 nd,
25th and 27th January 2016 have been challenged by
both petitioners as well as respondent No.6 by
filing   different    SLPs,   which   are   pending   for
consideration.   Notice    has   also  been   issued   by
this Court in SLP filed by respondent No.6 on
29.04.2016      and      on     18.07.2016,       SLP(C)
Nos.13527­13528 of 2016 filed by the petitioners
have been ordered to be tagged with the SLP(C)
Nos.10704­10705    of   2016.   The   subsequent    order
passed by Municipal Commissioner dated 31.08.2016
has been passed, in consequence of the judgment
of the Bombay High Court dated 22nd, 25th and 27th
January 2016. The order passed by the High Court
being   already    under    challenge,    by   both   the
parties   in  this   Court,   subsequent    order   dated
31.08.2016     has     also    been     challenged     by
petitioners by filing PIL No.17 of 2017 wherein,
learned counsel for both the parties before the

                                                      12
Bombay High Court have stated that the issues,
which are raised in PIL No.17 of 2017 are the
issues, which are already engaging attention of
this Court in above mentioned two SLPs filed by
both the parties. The High Court, thus, after
further hearing the parties granted liberty to
the writ petitioner to file an application for
transfer  of   PIL  No.17   of   2017   to   be   heard
alongwith pending SLP. It is submitted that all
the  issues  raised  are  issues    of  vital    public
importance, concerning with safety and security
of persons who will occupy the concerned building
and  it  is  necessary   that   issues   are    finally
decided by this Court so that correct and valid
measures   are   taken   by    respondent     No.2   to
respondent No.5 regarding construction and use of
the building which will house hundreds of people.
15. Shri Kapil Sibal, Sr. Advocate,        vehemently,
opposing  the   transfer   petition    contends    that

                                                     13
there is no ground to transfer the PIL No.17 of
2017 in this Court. Municipal Commissioner by an
order dated 31.08.2016 has decided all the issues
which have been questioned by the petitioners in
the High Court where all the issues can be gone
into and decided? In view of the subsequent order
of  the  Commissioner    dated   31.08.2016,   earlier
litigation   including    SLPs  filed    by  both  the
parties against the judgment of the High Court
dated 22nd, 25th and 27th January, 2016 ought not to
be required to be adjudicated on merits and it is
futile to transfer the PIL to this Court. It is
further   contended   that   in   none   of  the  Writ
Petitions filed by the petitioners or the SLPs
any interim order has been passed either by the
Bombay High Court or by this Court and it is for
the first time that on 24.02.2017 interim order
has been passed by the High Court in PIL No.17 of
2017.    It  is   contended   that   the  building  is
standing for last five years to be occupied by

                                                      14
the occupants who are waiting for occupying the
flats.   Petitioners    are   under   heavy   recurring
liability by paying interest per month to the
extend  of   crores   of  rupees,   which   is  causing
great hardship and prejudice to respondent No.6.
It is submitted that construction of the building
has been as per sanction plan and it is not the
case of anyone that there is any violation of
sanction plan. It is contended that the refuge
area is now earmarked adjoining each flats by
respondent No.6, which has been rightly accepted
by  Municipal   Commissioner    and  the  four   floors
which were separately earmarked as refuge area
has not been upheld. It is submitted that the PIL
initiated   by  the  petitioners    is  not   bona­fide
litigation and in fact it has been set up by
rival  builders    with   whom  respondent    No.6  has
dispute.   It   is  also    submitted   that   transfer
petition deserved to be rejected and the SLP(C)
Nos.11749­11750 of 2017 be allowed, setting aside

                                                       15
the interim order passed by the High Court dated
24.02.2017 as extended on 17.03.2017 in PIL No.17
of 2017.
16. We have considered the submissions of both
the parties and perused the record. The order
passed   by   the   Municipal     Commissioner     dated
12.09.2013, in pursuance of order passed by the
Bombay High Court on 13.05.2013 in PIL No.43 of
2012 was challenged by respondent No.6 in Writ
Petition(C)   No.2223  of   2013   before   the  Bombay
High Court. The order of the High Court dated
13.05.2013   passed   in   PIL   No.43   of   2013   was
already challenged by the Petitioners by SLP(C)
No.20279 of 2013. The Writ Petition(C) No.2223 of
2013 filed by respondent No.6 was decided by the
Bombay   High   Court   on   27.01.2016,     which   was
challenged   by  both  petitioners     and   respondent
No.6 by means of SLPs, as noted above. After the
order  dated   27.01.2016,    Municipal   Commissioner

                                                    16
proceeded to pass an order dated 31.08.2016. The
Municipal   Commissioner    after   re­examining  the
issue regarding refuge area held, as follows:
         “1. Periphery        refuge     area
         surrounding each flat on each
         floor(4 flats in number on each
         floor) was allowed.
         [Note: The total refuge area
         allowed    by    the    Commissioner
         surrounding the flats on each
         floor amounts to 60% of the
         habitable area on the respective
         floor]
         2.4 entire refuge floors were to
         be blocked.
         3. National Building Code 2005
         would    not   apply     since   the
         building is already constructed
         as   per    past    approved   plans
         (contrary to the Judgment dated
         27.01.2016).”
17. The    order    dated    31.08.2016    has   been
challenged by petitioners by filing PIL No.17 of
2017 in which Bombay High Court passed an order
on 24.02.2017 and 17.03.2017, as noted above. The
order of Commissioner dated 31.08.2016 has been

                                                       17
passed   in   pursuance    and   consequence     of  the
judgment   of   the  High   Court    dated  27.01.2016.
Judgment dated 27.01.2016 is now challenged in
this Court by SLP filed by both the parties. In
SLP  filed   by   respondent   No.6   notice   has  been
issued by this Court and the SLP filed by the
Petitioners has been tagged with other SLP.
18. The important issues, pertaining to refuge
area,  FSI   are   engaging   the   attention   of  this
Court.   Provisions    of   the   Development    Control
Regulations for Greater Mumbai, 1991 are under
consideration.    The developments carried out by
builders in buildings, which is to house hundreds
of  people     are   not   question     of   rights   of
developers alone. The development regulations and
various other statutory rules enjoin performance
of   various     statutory    duties    and   statutory
obligations     in   respect     to    development    of
buildings,    which    are   to   house    hundreds   of

                                                       18
occupants. The life and safety of occupants is a
matter of public importance and the issues raised
relate to public concern & safety which need to
be decided at the earliest.
19. The   concern    expressed   by  Shri   Kapil  Sibal
that   due   to   delay   caused   in   finalizing   the
issues, respondent No.6 has been suffering huge
loss, is also a matter of concern. Early decision
of such disputes is in the interest of both the
public in general as well as the persons who have
carried    out  development    after    incurring   huge
expenditure.
20. It is relevant to note that the Bombay High
Court   in   Paras    4  to  7   of   the  Order   dated
17.03.2017, noticing the facts that issues raised
in   PIL    No.17   of   2017  are     already   pending
consideration in this Court as mentioned in Para
5 has granted liberty to the petitioners to move
an application to file a transfer petition.

                                                     19
21. After having considered the submissions of
the  parties  and   perusing  the   material   brought
before   us, we are of the     opinion that issues
which   have   been   raised   in    the   SLP(C)   CC
Nos.13527­13528 of 2016 filed by the petitioners
and   SLP(C)  Nos.10704­10705    of   2016  filed   by
respondent No.6 have bearing on the PIL No.17 of
2017 and it is in the interest of all the parties
that such issues be decided finally, when the
issues   have  already   been  entertained    by  this
Court, as noted above.
22. Learned counsel for both the parties although
have raised various submissions touching on the
merits of issue but at this stage when we are
considering only the petition for transfer of PIL
No.17 of 2017 as well as the challenge to only
interim orders passed by Bombay High Court in PIL
No.17 of 2017, we refrain to express any opinion
on various aspects relating merits of the case.

                                                     20
The observations made by us in this order are
limited for deciding the transfer petition and
SLPs before us, such observations may not have
any bearing on the issues when they are finally
heard and decided.
23. It is further relevant to notice that the
SLP(C)  No.20279    of  2013,  which   was   filed  by
petitioner against the order dated 13.05.2013 of
the Bombay High Court in PIL No.43 of 2012, which
was  disposed     of   by  Three   Judge    Bench   on
13.05.2013, an application on I.A.6 has also been
filed by the petitioners to recall the order and
determine   the   issues.  No  order   has   yet  been
passed in I.A.6 of 2016, which application is
waiting for consideration by Three Judge Bench.
24. In   view    of   forgoing   discussion,    SLP(C)
Nos.10704­10705 of 2016 filed against order dated
27.01.2016 being pending consideration, ends of
justice   be   served   in  allowing    the   transfer

                                                   21
petition transferring the PIL No.17 of 2017 from
Bombay  High  Court  to  this  Court   to be   heard
alongwith  SLP(C)   Nos.10704­10705   of  2016   and
SLP(C) CC Nos. 13527­13528 of 2016. The transfer
petition is thus allowed.
25. Coming to SLP(C) Nos.11749­11750 of 2017, in
which   interim   order   dated    24.02.2017    and
17.03.2017 have been passed by the Bombay High
Court, in view of the order passed in Transfer
Petition(C) No.567 of 2017, the PIL No.17 of 2017
is being transferred to this Court. As on the
date we do not see any good ground to set aside
the aforesaid interim orders, however, PIL No.17
of 2017 having been transferred to be heard by
this Court, it is open for the parties to pray
for   alteration/modification/variation    of    the
aforesaid interim orders before this Court. The
SLP(C)  Nos.11749­11750   of  2017   are  dismissed
subject to above observations.

                                                22
26. In result, Transfer Petition is allowed and
the SLPs are dismissed subject to observations as
made above.
