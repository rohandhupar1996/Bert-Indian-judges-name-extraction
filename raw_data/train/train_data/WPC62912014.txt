3]            The petitioners’ company are limited companies carrying on their
business by getting the benefit of transport subsidy under the Transport Subsidy
Scheme, 1971. The writ petitioner in WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 has claimed the
disbursement of transport amounting to Rs.1,60,92,486/- (Rupees One Crore
Sixty Lakhs Ninety Two Thousand Four Hundren Eight Six) only, sanctioned by
the State Level Committee (SLC) for the period from 01.01.2006 to 31.03.2006.
The petitioner in WP(C) No.5620 of 2014 similarly has claimed the release of
transport subsidy amounting to Rs.38,42,909/- (Rupees Thirty Eight Lakhs Forty
Two Thousand Nine Hundred) only, for the period from 01.01.2007 to
10.03.2007, whereas the petitioner in WP(C) No.5622 of 2014 has claimed the
transport subsidy amounting to Rs.36,74,805/- ( Rupees Thirty Six Lakhs Seventy
Four Thousand Eight Hundred Five) only for the period from 01.10.2006 to
31.12.2006.
4]       The Government of India in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry,
Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), introduced a scheme as
the Transport Subsidy Scheme, 1971 (Annexure-1) which came into effect from
15.07.1971 for selected areas and to remain in force till 31.03.2007. The selected
areas amongst others included the North-Eastern Region. Clause-6 (iv) of the
Scheme amongst others proves that in the case of North-Eastern Region
comprise of the State of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and Union
Territories of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram the transport subsidy will be given
on the transport costs between Siliguri and the location of the industrial units in
these States/ Union Territories. While calculating the transport costs of raw
materials, the cost of movement by rail from Siliguri to railway station to the
nearest location of the industrial unit and thereafter, the cost of movement of
road to the location of the industrial unit will be taken into account. Similarly,
while calculating the transport costs of finished goods the costs of movement by
road from the location of industrial unit to the nearest railway station and
thereafter, the cost of movement by rail to Siliguri will be taken into account. In
the case of North-Eastern region, the raw materials moving by road or other
mode of transport the transport costs will be limited to the amount might have
WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 with WP(C) No.5620 of 2014
with WP(C) No.5622 of 2014

                                          5
paid had the raw materials moved from Siliguri by rail upto the railway station
nearest to the location of the industrial unit and thereafter, by road. Similarly, in
the case of movement of finished goods moving entirely by road or other mode
of transport in the North-Eastern region the transport costs will be limited to the
amount which the Industrial Unit might have paid at the finished goods moved
from the location of the industrial units to the nearest Railway station by road
and thereafter by rail to Siliguri.
5]      In terms of the provision of the Scheme, the industrial units are entitled to
transport subsidy to the extent indicated in the scheme vide notification dated
29.01.1998 (Anenxure-2). The respondent No.5 was declared the nodal agency
for realization of transport subsidy on the basis of the recommendation of the
State Level Committee for the North-East Region, as per the existing terms and
conditions of the scheme. It may be mentioned at this stage that vide notification
dated 22.11.2016, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of
Industrial Policy and Promotion refused the Promotion Policy for the North-East
Region and decided that henceforth the subsidy payable to the Industrial Unit
will be disbursed through the Direct Benefit Transfer mechanism by the Chief
Controller of Accounts (Industry) for which the units would need to get
themselves registered as per the process provided.
6]        The petitioners along with all other similarly situated companies have
been enjoying all the benefits of the scheme since the establishment of their
respective companies. On 09.06.2006 (Annexure-5) the respondent No.4 had
written a letter to the Director of the Commerce and Industries to the
Government of Assam recommending an amount of Rs.1,60,92,486/- (Rupees
One Crore Sixty Lakhs Ninety Two Thousand Four Hundren Eight Six) only as the
transport subsidy entitled to the petitioner in W(C) No.6291 of 2014 for the
period from 01.01.2006 to 12.03.2006 while forwarding the scheme application.
However, since the transport subsidy was not released to the petitioner, the
petitioner on 12.05.2009 (Annexure-6) wrote to the Directorate of Commerce
and Industries, Government of Assam, seeking clarification in view of the resent
Performance Audit carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) in
WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 with WP(C) No.5620 of 2014
with WP(C) No.5622 of 2014

                                        6
the North-Eastern Region. The C&AG had examined the Transport Subsidy
Scheme, 1971, more particularly Clause- 6 (ii) and observed that there was lack
of proper scrutiny in the Department prior to recommending payment of subsidy.
7]        In consequence thereof, the petitioner was required to produce certain
details and documents in support of the subsidy claimed from 01.01.2006 to
12.03.2006. According the petitioner, on 10.02.2009 (Annexure-7) they furnished
the required information to the respondent No.5. Consequently, the cheque
amounting to Rs.1,60,92,486/-(Rupees One Crore Sixty Lakhs Ninety Two
Thousand Four Hundred Eight Six) only issued by the respondent No.5 to the
petitioner on 14.12.2009. However, in view of the objection raised by the
Principal Director of Audit, Economic and Service Ministries, New Delhi, in their
performance audit report the cheque that was issued was directed to be returned
to the respondent No.5, which was accordingly returned. Following the return of
the cheque towards the transport subsidy claimed by the petitioner, the series of
correspondence is placed between the petitioner and the State Government in
the Commerce and Industries Department as well as the State Level committee
for the transport subsidy.
8]      On account of the C & AG having prepared the Performance Audit with a
finding that there was lack of proper scrutiny in the department concerned prior
to recommending payment of subsidy in terms of the Transport Subsidy Scheme,
1971, the clarification was made by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries,
Government of India, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) vide
communication dated 04.07.2014 (Annexure-14) to the effect that subsidy was
not admissible for the transportation cost incurred for inter-state movement of
finished goods within North East states railway station nearest to the final
destination. Several representations were made to the department concerned in
the Ministry of Commerce and Industries by the beneficiaries with a request to
review the decision relating to admissibility of finished goods for transport
subsidy under the scheme on its inter-state movement within the North-Eastern
region. Consequently, vide communication dated 04.07.2014 it was clarified that
by the Head Comptroller Accounts (DIPP) after careful examination and in
WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 with WP(C) No.5620 of 2014
with WP(C) No.5622 of 2014

                                          7
consultation with the Integrated Fiannce Wing           that in case of inter-state
movement of finished goods within the North-East Region, the cost of transport
beyond the railway head nearest to the delivery point where the finished goods is
being delivered is also to be taken in to account for subsidy under Transport
Subsidy Scheme, 1971. In other words the actual cost of transportation or
movement from the location of the industrial unit to the nearest railway station
by road and thereafter, by rail to the railway station nearest to the location
where the finished goods is to be received and subsequently, by road from that
railway station to the location where finished goods has been received,
whichever is less, will be taken into account. Accordingly, the Department’s
earlier letter dated 04.10.2013 was withdrawn. The Transports subsidy amount
pending in favor of the petitioner having not been released despite the
clarification issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, the petitioner
being aggrieved is before this Court by the instant writ petition along with two
others.
9]           Appearing for the writ petitioners, Dr. B.P. Todi, the learned Senior
Counsel submits that the petitioners along with all other similarly situated units in
the North Eastern region have been enjoying the benefit of the transport subsidy
introduced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, Government of Assam,
since the very inception. He submits that the scheme had been introduced
keeping in mind the remoteness of the region comparing to other parts of the
country. The industrial units in the North-East region cannot compete with the
industrial units of other parts of the country due to lack of proper communication
facilities. The very object of the scheme is to encourage the industrial units of
the region to compete with other industrial units of the well communicated
regions of the country. He further submits that if such subsidy is denied to the
industrial units in the North-East region, the very scope and intend of the scheme
would fail.
10]             Dr. B.P. Todi also submits that the transport subsidies have been
availed by the petitioners’ company over the years and the same cannot be
denied on account of the observation made by the C & AG that there was no
WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 with WP(C) No.5620 of 2014
with WP(C) No.5622 of 2014

                                           8
proper scrutiny prior to recommending the payment of subsidy. Moreover, now,
that the Ministry of Commerce and Industries has clarified the applicability of the
scheme to the North-East region. There is no reason for the respondent
authorities concerned not to release the transport subsidy due to the petitioners.
He also submits that the affidavit-in-opposition field by the respondent No.5
clearly indicates that the subsidy amount has not been released to the petitioners
only for lack of proper scrutiny in the Department prior to recommending the
payment of subsidy. Dr. B.P. Todi submits that the petitioners in fact have no
role in this scrutiny besides providing the necessary documents and materials
while making the claim for subsidy. The ground for denial of the subsidy is only
vague and does not reveal the process which has prevented the release of
subsidy amount. Under such circumstances and also considering the fact that the
clarification has already been made, the respondent authorities cannot keep on
hold the amount due to the petitioner. For the delay in release of the subsidy
amount, Dr. B.P. Todi submits that the respondent authorities are liable to be
directed to pay interest as has been ordered in other similar cases. He relies
upon the decision of this Court passed in the case of Union of India vs. J Tariang
reported in (2013) 2 NEJ 224, wherein, the Division Bench of this Court taking
note of the fact that there was due delay in release of the subsidy amount and
keeping in view the purpose of the Scheme, upheld the direction of the learned
Single Judge to pay simple interest @ 12% per annum. Similarly, he refers to
directions passed by this Court in WP(C) No.1743 of 2012 i.e. M/S Ri Balaji
Cement Pvt. Ltd vs. Union of India and 4 others, whereby, a direction was given
for releasing of the transport subsidy amount to the petitioner therein within a
specified time frame and failing which interest @ 12% per annum was imposed.
He, therefore, prays for a similar direction in the instant cases as well.
11]         Appearing for the respondent No.1, Mr. S.C. Keyal, the learned ASGI,
submits that the C & AG had conducted the performance audit in the North-East
Region states, wherefrom, it came to a finding that the transport subsidy
released to the industrial units lacked proper scrutiny in the Department prior to
the same being recommended for payment. The C & AG also took into account
the relevant provision of the Transport Subsidy Scheme, 1971, while making such
WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 with WP(C) No.5620 of 2014
with WP(C) No.5622 of 2014

                                           9
observation. He submits that the various States in the North East including
Assam were under the consideration of the C & AG where amongst others those
who were found to be the beneficiaries which otherwise were not entitled to. In
order to substantiate his submission, Mr. S.C. Keyal , the learned ASGI refers to
the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No.5 wherein the Performance
Audit of transport subsidy by the C & AG have been annexed as Annexure-B. Mr.
S.C. Keyal also by referring to the affidavit-in-opposition field by the respondent
No.1 submits that the C & AG pointed out other instances of irregularities in the
beneficiary states which included claim for the period from 01.01.2004 to
31.03.2004 amongst others. The C & AG had recommended that such cases be
investigated in depth, preferably supported by field visits and therefore, pending
such instruction and field verification, the transport subsidy claimed by the
petitioners should not be released. However, Mr. S.C. Keyal submits that
although the C & AG are yet to take a final call in the matter, he has received
instructions that the process for enabling the payment of the pending transport
subsidy in favour of the writ petitioners is directed to be processed.
12]        Since the learned ASGI has received the instructions for processing of
subsidy payable to the petitioners, there would be no difficulty in directing the
respondent authorities concerned to make the payment thereof. However, what
is required to be considered as to whether the petitioners should be paid any
interest towards delay payment of the transport subsidy under the Subsidy
Scheme of 1971. As can be noticed, the Ministry of Commerce and Industries,
Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion vide communication dated
04.07.2014 had clarified that in case of inter-state movement of finished goods
within the North-East region, the cost of transportation beyond the railway head
nearest to the delivery point where finished goods is being delivered is also to be
taken into account for the subsidy benefit. The actual cost of transportation or
cost of movement from the location of the industrial unit to the nearest railway
station by road and thereafter, by rail to the railway station nearest to the
location where finished goods is to be received and subsequently, by road from
that railway station to the location where finished goods has been received,
whichever is less is to be accounted. Despite such clarification, the petitioners
WP(C) No.6291 of 2014 with WP(C) No.5620 of 2014
with WP(C) No.5622 of 2014

                                          10
have not been released the transport subsidy amount due to them. Although the
Performance Audit of the C & AG detected that there was lack of proper scrutiny
on the part of the department concerned prior to recommending the concerned
units for availing subsidy, no formal proceeding have followed thereafter. In that
view of the matter while taking into account the Court decisions relied upon by
the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, I am of the considered opinion
that the petitioners are also entitled to be paid interest on account of the delay in
release of the transport subsidy.
13]        Considering the case in its entirety and upon perusal of the materials
available on record and after hearing the rival parties, the petitioners are found
to be entitled to release their respective transport subsidy along with interest @
12% per annum with effect from 04.07.2014 (the date on which clarification was
made) till final payment of the principal amount. Since the respondent No.5 is no
longer the Nodal agency in terms of the notification dated 22.11.2016, the
respondent Nos. 1 to 4 are directed to take necessary steps for releasing the
pending dues in favour of the writ petitioners towards transport subsidy along
with simple interest @ 12% per annum with effect from 04.07.2014 till final
payment as expeditious as possible and not latter then the outer limit of 3
(three) months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
14]          With the above observations and direction this writ petitions stand
disposed of. No cost.
                                                                          JUDGE
