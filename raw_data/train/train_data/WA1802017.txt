                                              WA No.180 of 2017
                               BEFORE
        HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
           HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
23.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
         Mr.B. Sinha, Mr. M Hussain, learned counsel for the
         appellant.
         Ms.P Chakraborty and Mr.K Pathak, learned counsel for
         Respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3.
         Heard on admission.
         This appeal is directed against the order dated 30.5.2017
passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court in I.A.
(Civil) No.313/2017, whereby he has vacated interim order dated
9.12.2016 passed in WP(C) No.7439/2016.
         The appellant in his WP(C) No.7439/2016 has challenged
the validity of letter dated 4.10.2016 issued by the Inspector of
Schools, Nalbari District Circle, wherein it is stated that
Government has approved the name of respondent as President
and that of appellant as Vice-President of the School Managing
and Development Committee (SMDC) of Paschim Banbhag Higher
Secondary School.
         Earlier vide interim order dated 9.12.2016, the learned
Single Judge stayed the operation of letter dated 4.10.2016. But
when the respondent informed that letter had already been acted
upon, the learned Single Judge by the impugned order has
vacated the interim order. The learned Single Judge has also
taken note of the fact that full-fledged School Managing and
Development Committee had already been constituted before
passing of the stay order with respondent as President and
appellant as Vice-President and even four meetings had been
held.
         After hearing the learned counsel for the appellant, we
find no good ground to interfere with the impugned order passed
by the learned Single Judge.

        The appellant may request the learned Single Judge for
early final decision of his writ petition.
        The appeal is dismissed summarily.
