                                           BEFORE
                     HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ARUP KUMAR GOSWAMI
                                 JUDGEMENT AND ORDER
                                           (ORAL)
         Heard Mr. S. K. Talukdar, learned counsel for the writ petitioner. Also heard Dr. B.
Ahmed, learned Standing counsel, Irrigation Department, appearing for respondent Nos. 1
to 7 as well as Mr. K. Sarma, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 8.
2.       The petitioner joined as a Grade-IV Muster Roll worker on 26.03.1993 in the
Irrigation Department under Guwahati West Division. In the year 2007, four posts of
Junior Assistant had become available to be filled up by way of promotion in the office of
the Superintending Engineer, Guwahati Project Circle (Irrigation). The petitioner and
respondent No. 8 were, amongst others, eligible for promotion. For the purpose of
promotion to the post of Junior Assistant, an interview cum written examination and type-
writing test, comprising of total 100 marks, was held on 28.07.2007 wherein the
petitioner and the respondent No. 8 along with others had participated. While the
petitioner secured the 1st position by obtaining 65 marks, the respondent No. 8 secured
2nd position by obtaining 56.5 marks. One Basanta Mazumdar, who belongs to MOBC
category, secured 3rd position and one Gautam Sarkar, who is a SC candidate, secured 7th
position. It appears that out of the aforesaid four posts, a post was reserved for SC
candidate, because pursuant to the aforesaid select list, appointment orders were issued
not only to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rank holders, namely, Dhiren Sarmah (i.e., the present
petitioner), Sri Anil Chandra Pathak (i.e., respondent No. 8 herein) and Basanta
Mazumdar, respectively, but also to Gautam Sarkar, who was placed at 7th position in the
select list.
3.       It is not disputed by the learned counsel for the parties that due to the Panchayat
Elections held in the year 2007, the Model Code of Conduct came into force with effect
from 27.11.2007 and it continued till the result of the elections were declared on
30.01.2008. The letter dated 05.07.2013 (Annexure-11 of the writ petition), issued by the
Superintending Engineer, Guwahati Project Circle (Irrigation), addressed to the Chief
Engineer, Irrigation, Assam, demonstrates that all the appointees had joined their service
as Junior Assistant after fifteen days of the receipt of appointment letter due to some
genuine reasons. A perusal of the said letter indicates that Gautam Sarkar and Basanta
Mazumdar joined their posts on 02.02.2008, while the petitioner and the respondent
No. 8 joined 04.02.2008 and 01.02.2008, respectively. It is indicated in the said letter that
in terms of Rule-II(i), the inter-se seniority of the aforesaid appointees would be on the
W P(C) 4386/ 2014

                                                                                              3
basis of their dates of joining. No reference was made to any particular Rule while
referring to Rule-II(i) in the said letter. It is also indicated in the said letter that though
the petitioner was, in fact, senior-most as per the merit list, his seniority could not be
retained.
4.      Subsequently, the petitioner submitted a representation for promotion to the post
of Senior Assistant claiming seniority according to the merit list, whereupon the Chief
Engineer, Irrigation Department, issued a letter dated 24.10.2013 (Annexure-12 of the
writ petition), to the Secretary to the Government of Assam, Irrigation Department,
seeking views/suggestions on the matter. In the said letter, it was explicitly stated that
the appointees appointed vide order dated 26.11.2007 could not join within fifteen days
due to Model Code of Conduct being in force. It was also noted in the said letter that the
Superintending Engineer (Irrigation) had prepared a Seniority List vis-à-vis the aforesaid
appointees as per their date of joining as follows:
            (1) Sri Anil Chandra Pathak
            (2) Sri Gautam Sarkar
            (3) Sri Basanta Kumar Mazumdar
            (4) Sri Dhiren Sarma.
5.      In response to the said letter dated 24.10.2013, the Under Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Irrigation Department (E), addressed a letter dated 10.12.2013 to
the Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department, to re-fix the seniority amongst the Junior
Assistants on the basis of merit-cum-seniority read with the provision of Rule-II of the
Assam Ministerial District Establishment Service Rules, 1967. It appears that in the letter
dated 05.07.2013 (Annexure-11 of the writ petition) the Assam Ministerial District
Establishment Service Rules, 1967, which will hereinafter be called “the Rules”, was
sought to be referred to.
6.      From a perusal of the minutes of the meeting of the Selection Board dated
23.07.2014 (Annexure-15 of the writ petition), it is seen that by placing reliance on II(i) of
the Rules, it was decided that the respondent No. 8 is the senior-most amongst the four
incumbents as he was the first to join the post on 01.02.2008.
7.      The writ petition is filed by the petitioner praying for a writ of mandamus directing
the respondents to consider his promotion to the post of Senior Assistant on the basis of
seniority as per the merit list. Though no order of promotion was issued in favour of
respondent No. 8, a prayer for an interim order was also made in the writ petition to stay
the joining of the respondent No. 8 as Senior Assistant.
W P(C) 4386/ 2014

                                                                                               4
8.      On 03.09.2014, an interim order was passed in the writ proceeding providing that
status quo, as on that day at 12.15 P.M., would be maintained with regard to the joining
of respondent No. 8. While passing of the said interim order, the Court took note of the
provisions of Rule-11 of the Rules.
9.      The respondent No. 8 filed a Misc. Application for vacating the interim order dated
03.09.2014 and the said application was registered as Misc. Case No. 3591/2014. The
Misc. Case was dismissed by an order dated 27.05.2015. As against that, a writ appeal
was filed by the respondent No. 8, being WA 221/2015, which also came to be dismissed.
10.     It is to be noted that in the aforesaid letters dated 05.07.2013, 24.10.2013 as well
as in the minutes dated 23.07.2014, the Rule referred to is recorded as “Rule-II”.
Apparently, what was sought to be relied upon was “Rule-11” of the Rules, which reads
as under:
        “11. (i) – In the Lower Division Cadre, the seniority shall be according to the date
        of appointment, if the persons join the appointments within 15 days of the receipt
        of the order of appointment.
                         Provided that in case of a person is prevented from joining within
                 the said period 15 days by circumstances of a public nature or for reasons
                 beyond his control, the appointing authority may extend it for further
                 period of 15 days. If the period is not so extended, his seniority shall be
                 determined in accordance with the date of joining.
                 When however more than one person are appointed on the same date
                 their inter-se seniority shall be determined according to their position in the
                 merit list prepared by the Deputy Commissioner as mentioned in Note
                 below clause (a) of sub-rule (6) of rule 6.
                         Provided further that in the case of assistants in the office of the
                 Deputy Commissioner, United Khasi-Jaintia Hills, their inter-se seniority
                 shall be in the order of preference as arranged by the appointing authority
                 in consultation with the Director of Employment and Craftsman Training,
                 Assam. Inter-se seniority among Lower Division Assistants appointed under
                 clause (a) and (b) of sub-rule 6 on the same date shall be according to the
                 following order:
                         (a) Assistants appointed under clause (a) sub-rule (6) of rule 6.
                         (b) Assistants appointed under clause (b) of sub-rule (6) of rule 6.
W P(C) 4386/ 2014

                                                                                              5
                        (ii) In the Upper Division (including Sub-Divisional Nazir) Cadre, the
                        seniority shall be according to the position in the Select List from
                        which the promotion to posts of Upper Division Assistant is made.
                        (iii) In the Supervisory Assistant Cadre, the seniority shall be
                        according to the position in the Select List from which promotion to
                        the posts of Supervisory Assistants is made.
                        (iv) In the Head Assistant Cadre, the seniority shall be according to
                        the date of promotion to the post of Head Assistant.
                        (v) In the Revenue Sheristadar Cadre, the seniority shall be
                        according to the date of appointment.
                        (vi) If confirmation of a member of the service in a cadre is delayed
                        on account of his failure to qualify for such confirmation, he shall
                        lose his position in order of seniority in that cadre vis-à-vis such of
                        his juniors as may be confirmed earlier than him. His original
                        position in that particular cadre shall, however, be restored on his
                        confirmation subsequently.”
11.     Rule 2 (4) of the Rules defines “District Establishment” to mean and include all
non-gazetted ministerial staff in the offices of the Deputy Commissioner, Sub-Divisional
Officers, Sub-Deputy Collectors and Block Development Officers of the District. Evidently,
the office of the Superintending Engineer is not a District Establishment under the Rules.
Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the reliance placed on Rule-11 of the Rules in
determining the seniority of the petitioner and respondent No. 8, they not being the
ministerial staff of a District Establishment, is entirely misplaced.
12.     Neither the learned Standing counsel, Irrigation Department, nor the learned
counsel for petitioner and respondent No. 8 has placed before the Court any other Rule
governing the service conditions of the petitioner and the respondent No. 8. The
petitioner having secured the 1st position in the selection test, obviously, as a general
rule, has to be considered to be senior to the respondent No. 8. In fact, in the letter
dated 05.07.2013, it was recorded that, otherwise, the petitioner is the senior-most as per
the merit list.
13.     However, by placing reliance on the Rules, which has no application to the
petitioner and the respondent No. 8, respondent No. 8 is sought to be held to be senior to
the petitioner on the ground that the merit position of the petitioner will not count and
that the date of joining of the incumbents will determine the seniority as both the
W P(C) 4386/ 2014

                                                                                           6
petitioner and the respondent No. 8 had joined their posts after fifteen days of issuance
of the appointment order.
14.     Having regard to the above discussions, I am of the considered opinion that the
petitioner having secured the 1st position in the selection test, he has to be considered as
senior to the respondent No. 8.
15.     The State respondents may undertake an exercise for giving promotion to the post
of Junior Assistant consistent with the observations and findings recorded in the
judgement.
16.     The writ petition stands allowed and disposed of. No cost.
17.     The interim order passed earlier stands vacated.
                                                                     JUDGE
