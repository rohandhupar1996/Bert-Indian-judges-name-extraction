                            JUDGMENT AND ORDER( ORAL)
        These bunch of writ petitions involve a common question and
therefore they are taken up together for disposal.
2.       Heard Mr. P Mahanta, the learned counsel for the writ petitioners in
WP(C) No.2858 of 2014, Mr. SC Biswas, the learned counsel for the
petitioner in WP (C) No. 1920 of 2015 whereas Mr. DK Sharma, the
learned counsel for the petitioners in WP (C) No. 2963 of 2014. Also heard
Mr. RC Saikia, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner in WP(C)
No.2537 of 2014.
3.       The question involved in the instant case is with regard to the
promotion of Khalasis working under the Public Health Engineering (PHE)
W.P( C) No.2858 of 2014, 1920 of 2015
2963 of 2014 & 2537 of 2014                                 Page 3 of 8

                                                                             4
Department to the next post of Section Assistant/Junior Assistant (Grade-
III). At the outset, it may be noticed that a challenge was made by the
writ petitioners in WP (C) No. 2963 of 2014 before this Court alongwith
similarly other situated persons that the Khalasis under the PHE
Department       were denied of any promotional avenues and in fact, the
vacancies which occurred at the relevant time was sought to be filled up
through direct recruitment by floating an Advertisement. The writ petition
that was filed by the said Khalasis was registered as WP (C) No. 434 of
2011. During the proceedings of the case, it was noticed that the
Advertisement for filling up the post of Sectional Assistant by direct
recruitment had not been finalized and taking into account the fact that
there was no recruitment rules for the post of Section Assistants, this
Court disposed of the writ petition on 28.4.2011, by directing the
respondent authorities to examine the desirability of having recruitment
rules for the post of Section Assistant to be filled up by promotion or direct
recruitment or both.
4.       The said decision was not acted upon by the respondent authorities
which prompted filing of the second writ petition under registration
number WP(C) No. 2428 of 2013 and which came to be disposed of vide
order dated 30.8.2013. This Court while disposing of the said writ petition
took into account the submissions made by the learned counsel
representing the PHE Department that the reservation of post in the ratio
of 50:50 by direct recruitment and promotion as contemplated vide letter
dated 10.4.2013 was modified by a decision taken on 31.5.2013 to fill up
the existing vacant posts in Grade-III or Grade-IV in the ratio 60% by
promotion and 40 % by direct recruitment. Considering such submission,
the writ petition was disposed of by permitting the authorities to take
steps for filling up the posts in terms of the decision taken on 31.5.2013.

                                                                            5
5.       Pursuant to the disposal of the two writ petitions, the State
respondents have drafted a draft recruitment rules in the PHE Department
for filling up of Grade-III and Grade-IV post in the name and style of
“Public Health Department, Grade-III and Grade-IV Field Level Employee
(Non-Gazetted) Service Rules”. With the draft rules in hand, the PHE
Department floated an advertisement for filling up three posts of Junior
Assistant/Section Assistant while prescribing the educational qualification
as Higher Secondary School Leaving Certificate (HSSLC) examination pass
from a recognized Board or University. The three petitioners in WP (C)
No.2963 of 2014 along with other eligible candidates responded to the
advertisement and the petitioners came to be finally recommended by the
Selection Committee which held its meeting on 9.1.2014. Despite the writ
petitioners being recommended, the respondent authorities have not
acted upon the recommendation till date.
6.       Appearing for the writ petition in WP (C) No. 2963 of 2014, Mr. DK
Sharma submits that despite reminders to the Chief Engineer concerned
by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of Assam, PHE Department,
the    petitioners    have    still   not been promoted in    terms    of the
recommendation made the Selection Committee which led to filing of the
writ petition.
7.       Mr. P Mahanta, appearing for the writ petitioner in WP © No. 2858
of 2014 submits that the State respondents are yet to finalize the
recruitment rules for the post of Section Assistants/Junior Assistant and
pending such finalization, the recommendation of the Selection Committee
held on 9.1.2014 cannot be acted upon. To substantiate his submissions,
Mr. Mahanta refers to the communication dated 1.10.2013 addressed to
W.P( C) No.2858 of 2014, 1920 of 2015
2963 of 2014 & 2537 of 2014                                Page 5 of 8

                                                                            6
the Chief Engineer, PHE Department by the Deputy Secretary to the
Government of Assam with instruction that pending finalization of the
draft service rules, the promotion process of Khalasis to the post of
Section Assistants is to be kept in abeyance. Such being the position, the
question of promoting the recommended candidates in terms of the
recommendation of the Selection Committee meeting minutes dated
9.1.2014 does not arise.
8.       Mr. SC Biswas, learned counsel for the writ petitioner in WP (C) No.
1920 of 2015 adopting the submissions made by the learned counsel Mr. P
Mahanta submits that in fact, the petitioners and those similarly situated
persons have been rendering their service under the PHE Department as
Khalasis for the past several years without any promotion while they are
entitled to at least one promotion during their service career. By referring
to the draft recruitment rules, he submits that educational qualification of
HSSLC fixed is without any justification and is most arbitrary in as much as
most of the Khalasis who have been rendering their services for the past
several years possess educational qualification only upto the level of HSLC.
Therefore, unless the respondent authorities consider this aspect of the
matter, the draft service rules prescribing HSSLC as the minimum
qualification for being considered for promotion to the post of Section
Assistant/Junior Assistant should not be finalized.
9.       At the stage, appearing for the PHE, the learned Standing Counsel
Mr. PN Goswami submits that although the draft recruitment rules
annexed by the private respondents in WP (C) No. 2858 of 2014 indicates
the educational qualification as HSSLC or equivalent, the instructions he
has received from the Chief Engineer (PHE), Water , Assam provides for
the educational qualification as HSLC for departmental promotion. By
W.P( C) No.2858 of 2014, 1920 of 2015
2963 of 2014 & 2537 of 2014                                 Page 6 of 8

                                                                           7
referring to the additional affidavit filed by the writ petitioner in WP (C)
No. 2858 of 2014, Mr. Goswami submits that on the other hand, the
advertisement issued by the Executive Engineer (PHE), Tezpur Division –II
for the post of Junior Assistant again indicates that the minimum
qualification of HSLC pass would be required for filling up the post on
direct recruitment basis. He therefore fairly submits that there is no
uniform procedure followed for the recruitment or promotion of the
eligible persons to the post of Section Assistants/Junior Assistant under
the PHE Department. He further submits that under such circumstance,
the respondent authorities may be permitted to take a proper decision in
the matter.
10.      I have considered the submissions advanced by the learned counsel
for the parties and I have also perused the materials available on record.
From the various documents that has been annexed in the writ petition
and in the response filed by the respective respondents, it can be seen
that the State respondents are yet to finalize the recruitment rules for the
post of Section Assistants/Junior Assistants. The recommendation of the
Selection Committee meeting minutes dated 9.1.2014 recommending the
three writ petitioners in WP (C) No. 2963 of 2014 are also admittedly yet
to be acted upon. However, in respect of one Khalasi i.e Dilip Choudhury,
promotion has been given to him on 2.7.2013 to the post of Junior
Assistant which perhaps is the only promotion that has been made under
the draft recruitment rules.
11.      Considering the controversy about the educational qualification for
being considered for promotion to the post of Section Assistants/Junior
Assistants, this Court is of the opinion that State respondents, more
particularly, Secretary to the Government of Assam, PHE Department
W.P( C) No.2858 of 2014, 1920 of 2015
2963 of 2014 & 2537 of 2014                               Page 7 of 8

                                                                           8
should take a decision by considering the grievance that has been
advanced by the petitioners in its entirety before any promotion can be
made to the post of Section Assistants/Junior Assistant in the PHE
Department and such decision should be taken as early as possible in view
of   the fact that the Selection Committee conducted its meeting as far
back as on 9.1.2014.
12.      In that view of the matter, the Secretary to the Government of
Assam, PHE Department is directed to finalize the recruitment rules for the
post of Section Assistants with due process by considering the grievance
raised by the petitioners and all other similarly situated persons. The said
exercise should be done as expeditiously as possible and not later than a
month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
13.      Pending finalization of the recruitment rules, status–quo shall be
maintained with regard to the recommendation of the Selection
Committee meeting minutes dated 9.1.2014. It is needless to observe that
if the persons recommended by the Selection Committee on 9.1.2014 are
found to be qualified in terms of the finalized recruitment rules to be
made, the recommendation of the Selection Committee will have to be
acted upon.
14.      With the above observations and directions, writ petitions are
disposed of. No costs.
