*       IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI

%       W.P.(C.) No. 8772/2019
        MONIKA WADHWA                                         ..... Petitioner
                             Through      Mr. Ankur Chhibber, Adv.
                             versus
        HIGH COURT OF DELHI                                   ..... Respondent
                             Through      Ms. Meenal Duggal, Adv. for
                             Mr. Viraj R. Datar, Adv.
        CORAM:
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJNISH BHATNAGAR
VIPIN SANGHI, J. (ORAL)
1.      The petitioner has preferred the present writ petition to assail the
order dated 24.02.2018 passed by the respondent whereby the petitioner’s
representation dated 08.02.2017 has been rejected.              The order dated
24.02.2018 passed by the respondent, in so far as it is relevant, reads as
follows:
                “I am desired to refer to your representation dated
        08.02.2017 requesting to appoint you to the post of Private
        Secretary w.e.f. 12.09.2011 (the date on which the post of Private
        Secretary became vacant with all consequential benefits) instead
        of 20.12.2016 and to inform you that the same has been
        considered and rejected by the competent authority.”
2.      The petitioner also seeks direction to the respondent to convene a
review DPC for her promotion to the post of Private Secretary with effect
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                      Page 1 of 15

from 12.09.2011, and to promote her to the said post with effect from
12.09.2011 i.e. the date on which the vacancy in the post of Private
Secretary (to be filled from 25% promotion quota of Senior Personal
Assistants) fell vacant.
3.      The petitioner was initially appointed as a Personal Assistant in this
Court on 06.01.2000. She was appointed as a Senior Personal Assistant
under the direct recruitment quota on 28.07.2006.        On 07.01.2012, the
respondent issued an order whereby the petitioner was confirmed in the post
of Senior Personal Assistant with effect from 23.12.2011. The case of the
petitioner is that a vacancy in the promotional post of Private Secretary
under the 25% promotion quota arose on 12.09.2011. Even though the
petitioner was confirmed in the post of Senior Personal Assistant with effect
from 23.12.2011, she was eligible to be considered for the said post of
Private Secretary from July 2011. However, she was not considered, as no
DPC was convened to consider promotion to the post of Private Secretary.
She was informed-in answer to her representation dated 07.03.2014, on
02.07.2014, that Hon’ble the Chief Justice on the recommendations of the
Committee constituted for the purpose, had ordered that the decision of this
Court in W.P. (C) 2836/2010, titled V.K. Mittal and Ors. vs. Registrar
General, Delhi High Court & Ors. be awaited, wherein erstwhile Rule 5A
of the Delhi High Court Staff (Seniority) Rules, 1971 was under challenge
for being declared void ab-initio. The further case of the petitioner is that
though the promotions were not made to the post of Private Secretaries,
promotions from the post of Private Secretary to the post of Assistant
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                               Page 2 of 15

Registrar continued to be made which led to three more vacancies arising in
the post of private Secretary.
4.      The case of V.K. Mittal (supra) was finally decided on 21.01.2016.
On 3.11.2016, the respondent issued a provisional seniority list of Senior
Personal Assistants, wherein the petitioner was shown at serial No.1. On
19.12.2016 the DPC was convened for promotion to the post of Private
Secretaries. Since the petitioner was at serial No.1 in the seniority list of
Senior Personal Assistants and she also was otherwise eligible, she was
found fit for promotion. On 21.12.2016, the petitioner was promoted to the
post of Private Secretary.
5.      The petitioner represented that she ought to be promoted as Private
Secretary with effect from 12.09.2011. She claimed that she had completed
her probation successfully in the year 2008; gained experience of 5 years
regular service from the date of appointment to the post of Senior Personal
Assistant in the year 2011; and there was a clear vacancy which arose on
12.09.2011 in the post of Private Secretary-to be filled by promotion
existing. Thus, she could not be denied retrospective promotion. The said
representation having been rejected, the present writ petition has been
preferred.
6.      The submission of Mr. Chhibber is that for no fault of the petitioner
her consideration to the post of Private Secretary by the DPC was delayed
from the year 2011 onwards, even though she was eligible in the year 2011
itself and there was a clear vacancy in the post of Private Secretary. She
was at serial No.1 in the seniority list of Senior Personal Assistants even in
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                Page 3 of 15

the year 2011. Mr. Chhibber submits that merely because the respondent
decided to await the decision in the case of V.K. Mittal (supra)-which
decision was rendered in the year 2016, is no reason to deny ante-dated
promotion to the petitioner from the date when the vacancy arose. He also
submits that even though the respondent stated that they would not make
promotions to the post of Private Secretary, they continued to make
promotions from the post of Private Secretary to that of Assistant Registrar
after 2011 without waiting for the decision in V.K. Mittal (supra). Mr.
Chhibber further submits that it was only when the petitioner was promoted
in the year 2016 prospectively, that she came to know that she would not be
granted retrospective promotion.       In support of his submission that
retrospective promotion could granted where the Government had
consciously intended to make promotions, but had not undertaken the
process of promotion, he places reliance on the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Major General H.M. Singh, VSM vs. Union of India &
Anr., (2014) 3 SCC 670 and B. Kumaravel v. Union of India & Ors, 2018
SCC OnLine Del 9015.
7.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent, who appears
on advance notice, has tendered in Court the minutes of the meeting of the
Committee for appointment/selection of officers of High Court and District
Courts held on 15.01.2018. A Committee of four Ld. Judges of this Court,
in the said meeting, considered the representation of the petitioner for
retrospective promotion with effect from 12.09.2011, and rejected by
placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Union of India & Anr. Vs.
K.L. Taneja, 2013 Lab IC 2108.
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                              Page 4 of 15

8.      Having heard learned counsel for the respondent, we are of the view
that there is no merit in this petition.
9.      It is a well settled proposition of law that, in service jurisprudence –
retrospective promotions are not recognized.          Retrospective promotions
could be granted only if a specific rule authorizing and empowering the
executive to accord such retrospective promotion exists in the relevant
service rules.
10.     The submission of Mr. Chhibber is that the petitioner was in no way
responsible for the delay in holding of the DPC for consideration of her case
for promotion to the post of Private Secretary.          The petitioner became
eligible for promotion to the post of Private Secretary in the year 2011 itself,
and there was a clear vacancy as well. The respondents gave the excuse for
not holding the DPC as the pending challenge to Rule 5(A) of Delhi High
Court Staff (Seniority) Rules, 1971 in the case of V.K. Mittal (supra). Mr.
Chhibber has gone on to even state that the said decision had no bearing on
the petitioner’s case for consideration for promotion to the post of Private
Secretary, and that the pending writ petition of V.K. Mittal could not have
been used as a reason to not to hold the DPC.
11.     As noticed, a Committee of four learned Judges of this Court, while
rejecting the petitioner’s claim for ante-dated seniority in the post of Private
Secretary placed reliance on K.L. Taneja (supra). The Committee also
rejected the petitioner’s reliance on several other decisions. The relevant
extract from the Minutes of the said meeting held on 15.01.2018 are
pertinent, and read as follows:
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                   Page 5 of 15

        “ In Union of India & Anr. Vs. K.L. Taneja and Anr. 2013
        Lab IC 2108, after extensively examining the case law on the
        subject for grant of retrospective promotion [ (1987) 4 SCC

        Hemraj Singh Chauhan], it has been held:
                “21. The cornucopia of case law above noted
                brings out the position:-
                (i) Service Jurisprudence does not recognize
                retrospective promotion i.e. a promotion from
                a back date.
                (ii) If there exists a rule authorizing the
                Executive to accord promotion from a
                retrospective date, a decision to grant
                promotion from a retrospective date would be
                valid because of a power existing to do so.
                (iii) Since mala fides taints any exercise of
                power or an act done, requiring the person
                wronged to be placed in the position the
                person would find himself but for the mala
                fide and tainted exercise of power or the act,
                promotion from a retrospective date can be
                granted if delay in promotion is found
                attributable to a mala fide act i.e. deliberately
                delaying holding DPC, depriving eligible
                candidates the right to be promoted causing
                prejudice.
                (iv) If due to administrative reasons DPC
                cannot be held in a year and there is no taint
                of malice, no retrospective promotion can be
                made.”
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                Page 6 of 15

        In the present case promotion could not be given earlier
        because of administrative reasons. There is no allegation of
        mala fides and taint in exercise of power or an act done. It
        is not the case that any junior to the representationist was
        granted promotion.
        Judgments relied upon by the representationists would not be
        applicable for the following reasons:
                (i)    Govt. of NCT of Delhi Vs. Rakesh
                Beniwal 213 (2014) DLT 748.
                In this case there was delay in issue of
                appointment letter and juniors were appointed
                earlier and granted promotion. Facts were
                peculiar. This was also a case of notional
                promotion and juniors were getting higher pay
                scales, having been promoted earlier.
                (ii)   Union of India Vs. G.D. Goel ILR
                (2008) Supp. (1) Delhi 44.
                This case is governed by paragraph 228 of the
                Indian Railways Establishment Manual. As
                there was specific provision, general principles
                laid down by the Supreme Court and High
                Courts recorded in K.L. Taneja and Anr.
                (supra) were not applicable. Hence, this
                decision is not applicable.
                (iii) Ramesh Kumar Vs. Union of India &
                Ors. AIR 2015 SC 2904.
                This case holds that denial of back wages and
                normal rule of „no work no pay‟, even in the
                absence of statutory provision, need not be
                invoked and applied in “appropriate” cases.
                (iv)   Union of India Vs. Sant Ram
                [W.P(C) 1955/2015 decided on 22.07.2013]
                This was again a case in which paragraphs 228
                of the Indian Railways Establishment Manual;
                specific provision/ rule was applicable.
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                Page 7 of 15

        In view of the above, the Committee recommends rejection of
        the representations.”               (emphasis supplied)
 12.    From the decision in K.L. Taneja (supra), it would be seen that mala
fides is recognized as an exceptional ground for grant of retrospective
promotion to do justice to the wronged person. In the present case, the
petitioner has not alleged any mala fides against any officer of this Court.
13.     Even if the petitioner was not at fault for the DPC not being convened
for consideration of her case for promotion to the post of Private Secretary,
so was the respondent, as the pendency of the writ petition of V.K. Mittal
cannot be treated as a fault attributable to the respondents. If the submission
of the petitioner is that the decision in V.K. Mittal (supra) would have had
no bearing, and could not have been given as a reason to delay the holding
of the DPC for consideration of her promotion to the post of Private
Secretary, it was for the petitioner to assail the memorandum dated
02.07.2014 and to invite a decision of this Court on the said aspect.
14.     However, the petitioner preferred the earlier petition i.e. W.P.(C.) No.
5700/2016 only in the year 2016, wherein no order was passed to the above
effect.
15.     Reliance placed by Mr. Chhibber on the decision of the Supreme
Court in Major General H.M. Singh (supra) is completely misplaced. The
facts of this case were that the appellant, at the relevant time, was the senior
most serving Major General, eligible for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General. A vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant General became available
while the appellant was in service. He represented that he being eligible for
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                  Page 8 of 15

promotion against the existing vacancy of Lieutenant General, his case
should be considered prior to the date of his retirement on attaining the age
of 59 years i.e. 29.02.2008. If the appellant were to be promoted to the rank
of Lieutenant General, his age of retirement would stand extended to 60
years and his date of retirement would be 28.02.2009. He requested the
respondents to immediately constitute and convene a meeting of the
Selection Board to consider his claim. Two days prior to the appellant’s
retirement on superannuation as Major General, on 27.02.2008, a meeting of
the Selection Board for consideration for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General was convened.          The Selection Board cleared the
appellant for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. The prescribed
procedure required the clearance of the appellant’s promotion by the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. Since the same was likely to take
time, the President issued an order on 29.02.2008, granting extension of
service to the appellant by a period of three months.              Since the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet could not finalise the matter even
during the said extended tenure of three months, the President once again
granted a further extension in service to the appellant by one month i.e. till
30.06.2008, or till the approval of the ACC, whichever was earlier.
Eventually, the Secretary of the ACC communicated on 02.06.2008 that the
ACC had not approved the promotion of the appellant to the rank of
Lieutenant General. The appellant assailed the said decision and order dated
03.06.2008, retiring him from the rank of Major General with immediate
effect before the High Court of Judicature of Madras. The Union of India,
inter alia, contended that the appellant having attained the age of
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                               Page 9 of 15

superannuation on 29.02.2008, could not be promoted as Lieutenant General
while he was on extension. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ
petition of the appellant. The Intra Court appeal preferred by the appellant
was also rejected by the Division Bench of the High Court. The Supreme
Court allowed the appeal preferred by the appellant. Learned counsel for the
petitioner has placed reliance on paragraphs 28 and 29 of the said decision,
which read as follows:
        “28. The question that arises for consideration is, whether
        the non-consideration of the claim of the appellant would
        violate the fundamental rights vested in him under Articles 14
        and 16 of the Constitution of India. The answer to the
        aforesaid query would be in the affirmative, subject to the
        condition that the respondents were desirous of filling the
        vacancy of Lieutenant-General, when it became available on
        1-1-2007. The factual position depicted in the counter-
        affidavit reveals that the respondents indeed were desirous of
        filling up the said vacancy. In the above view of the matter, if
        the appellant was the seniormost serving Major-General
        eligible for consideration (which he undoubtedly was), he
        most definitely had the fundamental right of being considered
        against the above vacancy, and also the fundamental right of
        being promoted if he was adjudged suitable. Failing which,
        he would be deprived of his fundamental right of equality
        before the law, and equal protection of the laws, extended by
        Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We are of the view that
        it was in order to extend the benefit of the fundamental right
        enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, that
        he was allowed extension in service on two occasions, firstly
        by the Presidential Order dated 29-2-2008, and thereafter, by
        a further Presidential Order dated 30-5-2008. The above
        orders clearly depict that the aforesaid extension in service
        was granted to the appellant for a period of three months
        (and for a further period of one month), or till the approval of
        the ACC, whichever is earlier. By the aforesaid orders, the
        respondents desired to treat the appellant justly, so as to
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                    Page 10 of 15

        enable him to acquire the honour of promotion to the rank of
        Lieutenant-General (in case the recommendation made in his
        favour by the Selection Board was approved by the
        Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, stands affirmed).
        The action of the authorities in depriving the appellant due
        consideration for promotion to the rank of the Lieutenant-
        General would have resulted in violation of his fundamental
        right under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Such an
        action at the hands of the respondents would unquestionably
        have been arbitrary.
        29. We are therefore of the view, firstly, that the order
        allowing extension in service of the appellant for a period of
        three months, dated 29-2-2008, and the order allowing
        further extension in service by one month to the appellant,
        dated 30-5-2008, so as to enable his claim to be considered
        for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-General,
        cannot be held to be in violation of the statutory provisions.
        Rule 16-A of the Army Rules, postulates extension in service,
        if the exigencies of service so require. The said parameter
        must have been duly taken into consideration when the
        Presidential Orders dated 29-2-2008 and 30-5-2008 were
        passed. The respondents have neither revoked, nor sought
        revocation of the above orders. Therefore, it does not lie in
        the mouth of the respondents to question the veracity of the
        above orders. The above orders were passed to ensure due
        consideration of the appellant's claim for promotion to the
        rank of Lieutenant-General. Without rejecting the above
        claim on merits, the appellant was deprived of promotion to
        the rank of Lieutenant-General.”
16.     The aforesaid decision has to be read and understood in the context of
the factual background taken note of hereinabove, which is starkly different
from the factual background of the present case. In that case the Selection
Board met before the appellant’s superannuation; the Selection Board found
the appellant fit for promotion as Lieutenant General; the President granted
extension to the appellant on two occasions to await the approval of the
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                  Page 11 of 15

ACC; the refusal of approval by the ACC was premised on the fact that he
was serving on extension. In that context the Supreme Court did not find the
refusal of approval to be valid and, consequently, allowed the appeal. These
peculiar facts make all the difference between the present case and General
H.M. Singh (supra). From the aforesaid extract from General H.M. Singh
(supra), we cannot discern any proposition that if a person, immediately
upon becoming eligible for consideration for promotion is not so considered,
despite existence of a clear vacancy in the promotional post, he would be
entitled to claim promotion from the date on which he became so entitled for
consideration, even if the DPC is held after a passage of some time. Thus,
the decision in General H.M. Singh (supra) is of no avail to the petitioner.
17.     Mr. Chhibber has also sought to place reliance on a Division Bench
judgment of this Court in B. Kumaravel (supra). A perusal of this decision
also shows that the same is also rendered in a completely different context.
In fact, this decision goes against the petitioner. This was a case where the
petitioner who was an Assistant Architect, became eligible for consideration
for promotion to the post of Architect, and though the respondent No. 2 had
initiated the promotion process in March 2003, no DPC was convened. The
Recruitment Rules were superseded by new Rules notified on 24.02.2004.
The issue that was considered by the Division Bench was whether the action
of the respondents in holding the DPC in August, 2005 as per the Rules of
2004 for filling up the existing vacancies in the post of Architect as on
01.04.2003, was justified.     This Court relied upon the decision of the
Supreme Court, inter alia, on Y.V. Rangaiah & Ors vs J. Sreenivasa Rao &
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                               Page 12 of 15

Ors., (1983) 3 SCC 284. After considering the decisions relied upon by
either of the sides, the Division Bench observed as follows:
        “27. Thus what emerges from the decisions relied upon by the
        learned counsels for the parties is that an eligible candidate
        does not have a right to insist that the vacancies must be
        filled as soon as they arise, but once there is a prescribed
        time frame laid down for completing the selection process
        and filling of vacancies, the said timeline has to be followed
        unless it is a case where pending amendment of Recruitment
        Rules, a conscious decision is taken by the department not to
        fill the vacancies, as per the then existing Rules.” (emphasis
        supplied)
18.     The petitioner has not pointed out any statutory or binding rule which
mandates or lays down a time limit for filling up of the existing vacancies in
the post of Private Secretary. Thus, the later part of the finding recorded-as
above extracted, is not attracted in the present case.
19.     In the facts of that case, the Division Bench also observed that the
respondents had not provided any justification for not holding the DPC in a
timely manner. As opposed to that, in the present case the respondents took
a conscious decision to withhold promotions, till the decision of the Court in
V.K. Mittal (supra).
20.     The Division Bench held that the petitioner was entitled to be
considered for promotion to the post of Architect in the year 2003 itself, and
that too on the basis of the 1989 Rules. The direction issued by the Division
Bench, inter alia, was as follows:
        31. For all the aforesaid reasons, the present writ petition is
        allowed and the impugned order is set aside. However,
        instead of directing the promotion of the petitioner to the
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                   Page 13 of 15

        post of Architect w.e.f. 01.04.2003, we deem it appropriate to
        direct the respondents to reconsider the petitioner for
        promotion as an Architect against the vacancy as existing
        on 01.04.2003 in accordance with the Central Architects
        Service Group ‘A’ Rules, 1989. The said exercise be carried
        out within 12 weeks from today. In case, the petitioner is
        found „fit‟ for promotion, his seniority shall be filed
        accordingly in the grade of “Architect” within six weeks
        thereafter. However, he would not be entitled to claim any
        arrears of monetary benefit-actual or notional on the basis of
        refixation of his seniority, if any. (Emphasis Supplied)
21.     Thus, the aforesaid decision in B. Kumaravel (supra) is also of no
avail to the petitioner. The real issue that came before the Division Bench
and decided by it was whether the unamended Rules of 1989 were required
to be followed in respect of vacancies which arose prior to the amendment
of the Rules in the year 2004 in view of the time limits prescribed for
holding the process of promotion in that case. The respondent was directed
to re-consider the petitioner’s case for promotion as an Architect against the
vacancy as existed on 01.04.2003 in accordance with the Rules of 1989 and,
if he was found fit for promotion, his seniority was liable to be fixed
accordingly.
22.     Pertinently, in the aforesaid decision the Division Bench also took
note of the decision of this Court in Pradeep Kumar v. Govt. of NCT of
Delhi, W.P.(C) Nos. 19087-91/2006, wherein the Division Bench had held:
        “28. In view of the aforegoing, it is clear that law in this
        regard is no longer res integra. The general rule is that
        vacancies occurring should be filled up as per the prevalent
        recruitment rules. The same is subject to two exceptions, i.e.
        when the rules are under consideration for amendment or
        revision and the authority has taken a conscious decision to
W.P.(C.) No.8772/2019                                                  Page 14 of 15

        defer further promotions until the changes are carried out or
        that the proposed new rules are to be made applicable
        retrospectively. Further, the decision to defer promotions
        should not be actuated by mala fides and must be based on
        proper reasons. Such a reason may be gathered from the
        background and circumstances in which the decision was
        taken. The right of an employee to be considered for
        promotion accrues only on the date of consideration of
        eligible candidates by the department and not before or if
        the rules provide for a particular time-frame in which the
        selection process is to be concluded. No right accrues to the
        candidates upon the occurance of vacancies.”
                                                 (emphasis supplied)
23.     In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we do not find any merit in
this petition. Dismissed.
