Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                               Page 2 of 10

2)       On 24.08.2015, the opposite party No. 1 represented by the opposite party
No. 2 filed a complaint before the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Kamrup (M) Guwahati, being N.I.Case No. 1954C/2015, against the opposite party
Nos. 3, 4, 5 and the present petitioner as accused persons alleging that they
committed offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881, as
amended read with Section 420 of the IPC as the five nos. of cheques bearing Nos.
000039, 000040, 000041, 000042 and 000043 all dated 31.03.2015 totaling an
amount 97,00,000/- drawn on Bank of India, Guwahati Branch in favour of the
complainant/the opposite party No.1 were dishonored on 30.06.2015 due to
insufficiency of fund, which were issued by the opposite party No. 4, the Managing
Director of the opposite party No. 3 company, who obtained loan from the opposite
party No. 1. Though the complainant/opposite party No.1 on 07.07.2015 issued
demand notice under Section 138 and 142 of the N. I. Act to the opposite party
No.4/accused No. 1 informing him regarding dishonoring of those cheques that
were issued by him amounting to Rs. 97,00,000/- and therefore, demanded said
amount of Rs 97,00,000/- within fifteen days from the date of receipt of said
notice. Though notices were duly served on 11.07.2015 to the opposite parties No.
4 and 5 and the petitioner on 14.07.2015, the complainant was served with a reply
dated 27.07.2015 by the counsel of the opposite party No. 3 that those cheques
noted above were issued as security cheques against excess interest debited by the
complainant against the account of opposite party No. 4, which was accordingly
protested by the opposite party Nos. 4 and 5, as regarding those cheques, the
matter was discussed in the office of the complainant and that the complainant
never issued any statement of interest nor intimated the opposite parties No. 4, 5
and the petitioner, the accused person of the case, regarding presentation of those
five cheques before presenting them to the bank.
3)       Thereafter, the complainant on 24.08.2015 filed the above noted
complainant, being N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 and on receipt of it, learned CJM by
order dated 24.08.2015 transferred the same to the Court of learned Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati for its disposal. On 11.09.2015
the complainant filed its evidence on affidavit and the learned JMFC after hearing
the complainant and going through said evidence on affidavit, found that the
complainant is a company and all the three accused, the opposite party Nos. 4, 5
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                              Page 3 of 10

and the petitioner being its Directors are responsible for day to day affairs of the
company and accordingly, said Magistrate came to a conclusion that the accused
persons, the present opposite party Nos. 4, 5 and the petitioner are involved with
the offence as alleged by the complainant and by order dated 11.09.2015 passed in
said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015         took cognizance of the offences and issued
summons to them for their appearance in the matter. As the petitioner did not
receive summon, by order dated 30.10.2015 learned JMFC in said N.I. Case No.
1954C/2015 issued bailable warrant of arrest against him for his appearance in said
matter and all the accused persons of the case appeared before learned JMFC on
02.02.2016, and the charges were read over to them, to which the accused
persons pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
4)       However, the petitioner/the accused No. 4 filed an application under Section
205 Cr.P.C. before said Trial Magistrate to dispense him from his personal
attendance in the said complaint case and to permit his authorised pleader to
appear in the proceeding and by order dated 17.06.2016 said Trial Court allowed
the petitioner to be represented by his counsel in the said N.I. Case No.
1954C/2015 until further order.
5)       The contention of the petitioner herein is that the petitioner while serving as
one of the Director in M/s. Surface Tech (India) Pvt. Ltd., the accused No. 1/
opposite party No. 3, the opposite party No. 4 on behalf of said company on
02.01.2012 applied for financial assistance amounting to Rs. 500 lacs under ‘Raw
Material Assistance Scheme’ from the complainant company and that an amount of
Rs. 300 lacs were sanctioned by the complainant/opposite party No. 1 on
06.01.2012, for which an agreement on 07.01.2012 was entered into between the
complainant/opposite party No. 1 and the accused No. 1 company/opposite party
No. 3, represented by accused No.2/the opposite party No. 4, with the terms and
condition mentioned therein and in the said agreement the opposite party Nos. 4
and 5 were the 1st and the 2nd surety whereas the petitioner was the 3rd surety, on
behalf of the borrower company, the opposite party No. 3. In August 2013, the
petitioner resigned from the post as Independent Director of the borrower
Company, the opposite party No. 3, which was duly informed to the opposite party
Nos. 4 and 5 and the necessary formalities regarding the same with the Office of
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                                 Page 4 of 10

the Registrar of the Companies, Government of India were completed on
10.05.2014 and the requisite Form ‘Dir-12’ was issued as required under the
provisions of the Companies Act and the Rules framed under it confirming the
resignation of the petitioner as Independent Director from the Board of Directors
from the Accused No.1 Company w.e.f. 10.05.2014 and since then the petitioner is
not connected with the opposite party No. 3 Company. In the meanwhile the
opposite party No. 4, on behalf of his company, the opposite party No. 3, on
23.05.2013 applied for ‘Raw Material Assistance Scheme’ from the Complainant
opposite party No. 1 for another amount of Rs. 200 lacs and by letter dated
02.07.2013 the complainant company intimated the opposite party No. 3 company
regarding sanctioning of said Rs. 200 lacs with overall credit of Rs. 500 lacs,
enhancing from Rs. 300 lacs and for that purpose an agreement was executed on
02.07.2013 between the Complainant/opposite party No. 1 and the and the
opposite party No. 3/accused No. 1 company, represented by the opposite party
No. 4/accused No. 2, with the terms and condition mentioned therein and in the
said agreement the opposite party Nos. 4 and 5 were the 1st and the 2nd surety on
behalf of the borrower company, the opposite party No. 3; but the petitioner was
not a signatory to the said agreement. The petitioner also submits that as per the
Complainant in its N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015, the cause of action arose on
31.03.2015,     followed   by   29.06.2015,   30.06.2015,  07.07.2015    07.08.2015,
14.07.2015 and 30 07.2015 and as the petitioner was not connected with the
opposite party No. 3 Company w.e.f. 10.05.2014 and therefore, it is submitted that
he is no way involved with the incident and the commission of the offence as
evident from the N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 itself, the complainant/opposite party
No.1 filed the same only to harass him. It is also submitted by the petitioner that
the complainant/opposite party No. 1 did not make any specific statement in its
complaint as to how the petitioner is involved in the commission of the alleged
offence. Hence this criminal petition by the petitioner/accused No. 4, for quashing
the proceeding of said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 as well as the said complaint
against him.
6)        The petitioner has placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of National Small Industries Corporation Limited -Vs- Harmit Singh
Paintal and Another, reported in (2010) 3 SCC 330.
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                               Page 5 of 10

7)       Appearing on behalf of the complainant/opposite party Nos. 1 and 2, Mr.
Jayanta Deka, learned counsel submits that the petitioner is the 3rd surety on behalf
of the opposite party No. 3 Company and the petitioner being one of the Director of
the Company as on 06.01.2012 when the complainant sanctioned an amount of Rs.
300 to the opposite party No. 3 Company towards ‘Raw Material Assistance
Scheme’ and he being one of the signatory of the agreement dated 07.01.2012 as
3rd surety that was executed between the complainant and the opposite party No. 3
Company and that the petitioner being one of the Director of the said Company, he
is responsible for the offences under Section 138 of the N.I. Act read with Section
420 of the IPC. Mr. Deka further submitted that since such offences have been
committed with the full knowledge of the petitioner, therefore, he is an accused
and responsible for those offences.
8)       Mr. Deka in support of his argument for the complainant/opposite party
Nos. 1 and 2, placed reliance of the Apex Court in the case of Rallies India Limited -
Vs- Poduru Vidya Bhushan and others, reported in (2011) 13 SCC 88, Central Bank
of India -Vs- C.L.Vimla and others, reported in 2015 17 SCC 337 and Krishna
Texport and Capital Market Limited -Vs- Ilaa Agarwal and others, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 28. Relying on these judgment Mr. Deka submits that the petitioner is
an accused in N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 and that specific averment has been made
against him in the complaint pertaining to said Complainant Case that he is the 3rd
surety of the agreement dated 07.01.2012 between the complainant Corporation
and the accused borrower Company wherein he use to serve as Director and that
he had full knowledge regarding the commission of the offence under section 138
of the N. I. Act by the accused opposite party No. 3 Company and if at the relevant
point of time he was neither the Director or nor involved with the case, the onus is
upon him to lead evidence during the trial for discharging him from the liability and
not in a criminal petition under Section 482 CrPC. Mr. Deka further submits that
since the petitioner is the 3rd surety as per the agreement dated 07.01.2012, he
cannot escape from his liability on behalf of the accused/opposite party No.1
Company. Mr. Deka also submits that as the petitioner was one of the Director of
the Company who was in the charge of the affairs of the Company and responsible
for the affairs of the company, as such for the offence committed by the
accused/opposite party No. 3 Company, the petitioner being one of its Director and
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                                Page 6 of 10

being in charge of that Company for conduct of its business, is also deemed to be
guilty and therefore, the criminal petition filed by him against the said N.I. Case No.
1954C/2015 should be dismissed.
9)       Considered the arguments advanced by the parties as well as the
judgments cited by them.
10)      It is seen that the initially the complainant/opposite party No. 1 Corporation,
on 06.01.2012 sanctioned an amount Rs 300 lacs to the said Company on its
application made on 02.01.2012 under the ‘Raw Material Assistance Scheme’ and
for that on 07.01.2012 an agreement between the Complainant Corporation and
the opposite party No.3/accused borrower Company was registered wherein the
petitioner was the 3rd surety for said opposite party No. 3 Company being one of its
Director. Subsequent to that the opposite party No. 3 Company on 23.05.2013
submitted another application for Rs. 200 lacs under the ‘Raw Material Assistance
Scheme’ and the said amount was sanctioned by the Company on 02.07.2013 with
overall credit of Rs 500 lacs and for that a fresh agreement was signed between
the complainant Corporation and borrower Company/ the accused/opposite party
No. 3, wherein the Managing Director of said Company, the opposite party No. 4
and his wife opposite party No. 5 were the 2nd and 1st surety respectively, in which
it was specifically provided that the fresh agreement is to operate as a ‘Continuing
Security’     for  the   balance     from   time  to  time  due   to   the   Corporation
(complainant/opposite party No.1) and also for the ultimate balance to become due
on the said account of the borrower and that the borrower agrees to reimburse the
Corporation on demand or any amount that it pays or may be required to pay or
bear by way of levy charges of duties and/or taxes on the said material procured
on behalf of the borrower in terms of the said agreement whither before or after
the delivery of the said material and that the Corporation possessed the right to
recover        personally from the proprietor partners/Directors/Members of the
Borrowers, from the 1st surety and the 2nd surety jointly and severally or from their
proprieties or from the guarantor bank as the case may be the balance from the
time being and the proprietor, partners, Directors or the 1st surety or 2nd surety as
the case may be. The Corporation Bank gave a statement that total outstanding
amount by the borrower/opposite party No. 3 is Rs. 1,18,02,563/- and the cause of
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                                  Page 7 of 10

action in the said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 arose on 31.03.2015 and on its
subsequent dates. The petitioner who is the accused No. 4 in said complaint case
have resigned from the Company w.e.f. 14.08.2013 and he on 07.02.2014 sent
reminder to the Registrar of Companies to send Form Dir-12 and thereafter it is on
10.05.2014 the Registrar of Companies issued the necessary Form DIR-12 for
change of name of Directors of the borrower Company, which clarified that the
petitioner resigned as Director of the Borrower Company w.e.f. 10.5.2014.
11)      In the case of the National Small Industries Corporation Limited -Vs- Harmit
Singh Paintal and Another, reported in (2010) 3 SCC 330 wherein in a their
Lordships have held that –
         “12. ……………….. what is required is that the persons who are sought to be made
         vicariously liable for a criminal offence under Section 141 should be, at the time
         the offence was committed, was in-charge of, and was responsible to the
         company for the conduct of the business of the company. Every person
         connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. Only
         those persons who were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the
         business of the company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for
         criminal action. It follows from the fact that if a Director of a Company who was
         not in- charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         company at the relevant time, will not be liable for a criminal offence under the
         provisions. The liability arises from being in-charge of and responsible for the
         conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time when the offence
         was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a
         company.
         13. Section 141 is a penal provision creating vicarious liability, and which, as per
         settled law, must be strictly construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a
         bald cursory statement in a complaint that the Director (arrayed as an accused)
         is in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of
         the company without anything more as to the role of the Director. But the
         complaint should spell out as to how and in what manner Respondent No.1 was
         in-charge of or was responsible to the accused company for the conduct of its
         business. This is in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes,
         especially, where such statutes create vicarious liability.
         14. A company may have a number of Directors and to make any or all the
         Directors as accused in a complaint merely on the basis of a statement that they
         are in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company
         without anything more is not a sufficient or adequate fulfilment of the
         requirements under Section 141.
         15. In a catena of decisions, this Court has held that for making Directors liable
         for the offences committed by the company under Section 141 of the Act, there
         must be specific averments against the Directors, showing as to how and in what
         manner the Directors were responsible for the conduct of the business of the
         company.
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                                       Page 8 of 10

         38. But if the accused is not one of the persons who falls under the category
         of "persons who are responsible to the company for the conduct of the
         business of the company" then merely by stating that "he was in-charge of
         the business of the company" or by stating that "he was in- charge of the
         day-to-day management of the company" or by stating that "he was in-
         charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the
         business of the company", he cannot be made vicariously liable under
         Section 141(1) of the Act. To put it clear that for making a person liable
         under Section 141(2), the mechanical repetition of the requirements under
         Section 141(1) will be of no assistance, but there should be necessary
         averments in the complaint as to how and in what manner the accused was
         guilty of consent and connivance or negligence and therefore, responsible
         under sub-section (2) of Section 141 of the Act.”
12)      In the N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 it is seen that the complainant opposite
party No. 1 is totally silent as to how on the date of occurrence of the offence i.e.
on 31.03.2013 and thereafter, the petitioner is involved with the offence as alleged
by the said complainant. From the perusal of the complaint in the said N.I. Case
No. 1954C/2015, it can be seen that no specific averment has been made by the
complainant regarding the role of the petitioner for the offences as alleged as on
31.03.2015 and thereafter except that he was the 3rd surety in the agreement
dated 07.01.2012 when he was one of the Director of the borrower/accused No. 1/
opposite party No. 3 Company.
13)      Moreover, while taking cognizance of the offences as alleged in said N.I.
Case No. 1954C/2015 and issuing summons to the petitioner/accused No. 4, the
Trial Court did not consider the aspect that the petitioner is residing at a place
beyond his territorial jurisdiction.
14)      After the amendment of CrPC, by the Amendment Act of 2005, it is settled
that with regard to private complaint, it is mandatory for the trial magistrate to
postpone the issue of process against the accused persons when they are outside
its territorial jurisdiction, as it was found necessary in order to protect innocent
persons from being harassed by unscrupulous persons and making it obligatory
upon the magistrate to enquire into the case himself, or to direct investigation to
be made by a police officer, or by such other person as he thinks fit for the purpose
of finding out whether or not, there was sufficient ground for proceeding against
the accused before issuing summons in such cases.
Crl. Ptn. No. 159 of 2016                                                Page 9 of 10

15)      From the complaint pertaining to said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 of the
complainant/opposite party No. 1, it can be seen that the accused No. 4, the
petitioner herein is residing at a place beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Trial
Magistrate, i.e. learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati
and without making any statutory enquiry, said Magistrate by the impugned order
dated 11.09.2015 passed in said Complainant Case No. 1954C/ 2015 took
cognizance of the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act 1881 as amended as
alleged in the said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 and issued summons to the petitioner/
accused No. 4 for his appearance in the case.
16)      For the reasons above, the Court is of the opinion that the order dated
11.09.2015 passed by the Trial Magistrate, i.e. learned Judicial Magistrate, First
Class, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati in said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015 taking
cognizance of the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act 1881 as amended
against the petitioner is bad in law as well as the proceeding of said N.I. Case No.
1954C/2015, preferred by the opposite party No. 1/complainant is also bad in law
and if proceeding of said N.I. Case No. 1954C/2015, presently pending for disposal
