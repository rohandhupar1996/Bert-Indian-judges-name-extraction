        CORAM:
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
                                JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      The Appellant Insurance Company impugns a judgment dated 17.05.2012
        passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the Claims Tribunal)
        whereby a compensation of ` 1,20,603/- was awarded in favour of the
        First Respondent for having suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident
        which occurred on 21.09.2006.
2.      The only ground urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant Insurance
        Company is that a notice under Order XII Rule 8 CPC was issued to the
        Respondent No.3, the owner of the vehicle, to produce the valid permit in
        respect of the vehicle No.HR-39A-5147 to ply the same in the State of
        Haryana at the time of the accident. Despite the service of notice, the
        owner failed to produce the permit.

3.      It is, thus, argued that the Appellant Insurance Company discharged its
        initial onus to prove that there was breach of the terms and conditions of
        policy on the part of the Insured.
4.      It is further urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant Insurance
        Company that the driver and the owner of the offending vehicle preferred
        not to contest the proceedings despite service of the notice, and therefore,
        an adverse inference ought to have been drawn against the owner of the
        offending vehicle.
5.      The Appellant Insurance Company entered into a contract of insurance
        with Respondent No.3 (Kartar Singh), the owner of the Truck No.HR-
        39A-5147. It was aware of the Transport Authority where the vehicle was
        registered. It also had means to inquire whether the vehicle had a valid
        permit at the time of the accident or not, but failed to do so.
6.      The Claims Tribunal taking all these facts into consideration relied on a
        judgment of this Court in ‘Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Ltd.
        v. Bhikhari Yadav & Ors.’, MAC APP.727/2011, decided on 03.01.2012,
        where this Court held that the Appellant Insurance Company could have
        summoned the record from the office of the Transport Authority to find
        out if the owner (Insured) had a valid permit to ply the vehicle on the
        road.       It was further held that in the absence of any evidence the
        Insurance Company cannot be said to have discharged its initial onus to
        prove that there was breach of the terms and conditions of policy.
7.      This case is squarely covered by the judgment of Bhikhari Yadav (supra).
8.      The Appeal is frivolous; the same is accordingly dismissed in limine.

9.      Statutory amount of Rs.25,000/-, if any, shall be refunded to the
        Appellant Insurance Company.
10.     Pending Applications stand disposed of.
