                                  Heard Ms. S. Borpatragohain, the learned Counsel appearing for
                  the petitioner. Mr. D.P. Borah, the learned Standing Counsel, Health Department
                  appears for the respondent Nos.1 – 4. The learned Government Advocate Mr.
                  CKS Barua represents the respondent Nos.6, 7 & 8. The rival litigant Bitu Kurmi
                  (respondent No.5), is represented by Mr. M.A. Sheikh, the learned Counsel.
                  2.1              The matter pertains to admission for medical studies in the year
                  2011, in the Government Medical and Dental Colleges of Assam. The petitioner
                  belongs to the Jolha community which is recognized as a Tea & Ex-Tea Garden
                  Category    and as per the Information Brochure, 2011, 6 MBBS seats were
                  reserved for this category. On the basis of performance of the applicant in the
                  Common Entrance Examination Test (hereinafter referred to as “the Entrance
                  Test”), the petitioner’s Roll No. 140390 was included in the Tea Garden Labour
                  /Ex-Tea Garden Labour Category (hereinafter referred to as ”the TGL/Ex-TGL
                  Category”) in the Educational Notice dated 1.7.2011 (Annexure-C). But when the
                  petitioner with his 2076th rank in the Entrance Test went for counseling, he was
                  not considered on the ground that the Jolha community is not listed amongst the
                  92 Tea and Ex-Tea Garden Tribes, in the Schedule-II of the Information
                  Brochure, 2011.
                  2.2             Aggrieved by the admission refusal, the petitioner initially
                  challenged the admission of Bitu Kurmi (respondent No.5) in the TGL/Ex-TGL
                  Category reserved seats. However since the relief by way of admission is no
                  longer possible by efflux of time, the litigant was allowed by the Court on
                  5.4.2016 to amend the writ petition. Accordingly the petitioner now applies for
                  compensation through amendment, on account of denial of admission in the year
                  2011.
                  3.1             Ms. S. Borpatragohain, the learned Counsel for the petitioner
                  refers to the caste certificate countersigned by the D.C., Golaghat on 5.1.2007
WP(c) No.4128/2011
                                                                              Page 2 of 5

                                                             3
                  (Annexure-E), to project that the petitioner is certified to be a Member of the
                  TGL/Ex-TGL Category and she refers to the Government OM dated 4.1.1984
                  (Annexure-F) to project that the Jolha Community is recognized as one of the 90
                  Tea & Ex-Tea Garden Communities, in Assam. Accordingly the petitioner
                  questions the logic of exclusion of the Jolha Community from Schedule-II of the
                  Information Brochure, which relate to the Tea & Ex-Tea Garden Tribes.
                  3.2             As the petitioner’s name was shown as the first waitlisted
                  candidate, the learned Counsel submits that admission of Bitu Kurmi (respondent
                  No.5), whose Roll Number was missing from the Admission Notice, could not
                  have been given admission in the MBBS seats, reserved for the TGL/Ex-TGL
                  Category.
                  4.1             On the other hand, Mr. D.P. Borah, the learned Standing Counsel
                  for the Health Department refers to the Page-3 of the additional affidavit filed on
                  22.8.2012 to project that in the Entrance Test, the petitioner with his Roll
                  No.140390 was ranked 2076th, towards the bottom whereas the respondent No.5
                  in the same category, was placed in 1341th rank. Therefore, the admission to the
                  higher ranked private respondent, is contended to be justified by Mr. Borah.
                  4.2             The departmental lawyer further submits that the last applicant in
                  the TGL/Ex-TGL Category who was granted admission was ranked 1673th and
                  therefore he argues that the petitioner with his lower rank of 2076th, cannot
                  make a legitimate complaint of deprivation of admission, in the reserve Category
                  seats.
                  4.3             In so far as the missing Roll Number of Bitu Kurmi (respondent
                  No.5) in the Educational Notice dated 1.7.2011 (Page-22), Mr. Borah refers to
                  the averments made in paragraph-13 of the Government’s additional affidavit
                  filed on 22.9.2011 to project that Bitu Kurmi (respondent No.5) in fact, had
                  sought admission in the TGL Category but inadvertently, his Roll Number was not
                  shown in the admission notice. But when the mistake came to light during
                  verification, the necessary rectification was done. Thus, the respondent No.5 was
                  correctly considered under the TGL Category          and by virtue of his better
                  performance in the Entrance Test, he was given admission in preference to the
WP(c) No.4128/2011
                                                                                Page 3 of 5

                                                            4
                  petitioner.
                  5.              The learned Government Advocate Mr. CKS Baruah submits that
                  the Jolha Community is recognized as the TGL/Ex-TGL Category under the
                  Government O.M. dated 4.1.1984 and accordingly the Counsel submits that if
                  petitioner’s performance in the Entrance Test would have been better, he could
                  have legitimately claimed admission in the TGL/Ex-TGL Category. But
                  unfortunately, his result did not merit admission.
                  6.              Representing the private respondent No.5, the learned Counsel
                  Mr. M.A. Sheikh submits that his client Bitu Kurmi with Roll NO.32000 secured
                  the 1341th    rank in the Entrance Test and therefore, it is argued that the
                  admission of respondent No.5 cannot be questioned by the petitioner, who had
                  secured the lower 2076th rank, in the Entrance Test.
                  7.              Admission to MBBS and other courses as per the applicable norms
                  are to be made on the basis of merit in the Entrance Test, under the Medical
                  Colleges of Assam, Regional Dental College, Guwahati and Government
                  Ayurvedic College, Guwahati (Regulation of Admission of Undergraduate
                  Students) Rules, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2007 Rules”). The list of
                  communities covered in Tea & Ex-Tea Garden Category, are mentioned in
                  Schedule-II of the admission brochure but surprisingly, the Jolha Community
                  does not find place in the Schedule-II of the admission brochure. This created
                  some confusion on the entitlement of the petitioner to be considered under the
                  TGL/Ex-TGL Category and that is why, he was not considered during the
                  counseling stage. But what is important is that nobody with lower merit than the
                  petitioner, was granted admission in the TGL/Ex-TGL Category. As earlier noted,
                  the petitioner’s rank in the Entrance Test was 2076th whereas those who were
                  admitted in the reserve category seats (including the respondent No.5) were
                  ranked much higher than the petitioner. Therefore, by virtue of his result, the
                  petitioner cannot make a legitimate complaint, of unlawful deprivation.
                  8.      The absence of Roll Number of Bitu Kurmi (respondent No.5) in the
                  admission notice under the TGL/Ex-TGL Category is projected to be a bona fide
WP(c) No.4128/2011
                                                                              Page 4 of 5

                                                             5
                  error, which was subsequently corrected. The petitioner nowhere contends that
                  Bitu Kurmi (respondent No.5) does not belong to the TGL/Ex-TGL Category or
                  that he was ranked lower than the petitioner, in the Entrance Test. Therefore,
                  admission granted to the better merited candidate in the same category, cannot
                  give rise to a claim for compensation by a lesser merited candidate and hence,
                  this issue is answered against the petitioner.
                  9.               When the Assam Government O.M. dated 4.1.1984 recognizes the
                  Jolha Community as one amongst the 90 the TGL/Ex-TGL Category, the listing of
                  communities of this category in the admission brochure, should have been
                  accurate without omission and greater care is expected. But for the purpose of
                  the claim for compensation, this exclusion may not be a very relevant factor
                  since the petitioner even if considered to be in the TGL/Ex-TGL Category, cannot
                  secure admission, by virtue of his 2076th rank, in the Entrance Test.
                  10.              The admission under the applicable norms is to be granted on the
                  basis of the merit in the Entrance Test and considering the inferior rank of the
                  petitioner, it is not a case of unlawful denial of admission since the last candidate
                  in the TGL/Ex-TGL Category, was ranked much higher than the petitioner. The
                  admission to respondent No.5 was also similarly given on the basis of his better
                  performance, in the Entrance Test. Thus the petitioner did not merit admission.
                  11.              Considering the above factors, the denial of admission to the
                  petitioner does not in my view, entitle him to claim compensation. Hence no
                  relief can be granted in this case and the same is accordingly dismissed. No cost.
                                                                                        JUDGE
