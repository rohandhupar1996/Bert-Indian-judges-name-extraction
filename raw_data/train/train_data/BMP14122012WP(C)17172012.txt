P R E S E N T:
                   THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA
                               Date of Judgment: 14.12.2012
B.N. Mahapatra, J.         These writ petitions have been filed to quash the order
       dated 09.12.2011 passed under Annexure-6 by opposite party No.1-
       Commissioner-cum-Secretary, School and Mass Education Department,
       Odisha, Bhubaneswar, wherein it has been held that petitioners having
       being disengaged as Education Volunteers working in Alternative Innovative
       Education (for short ‘AIE’) Centres under the Employment Guarantee
       Scheme (for short ‘EGS’) their case cannot be considered for engagement as
       Ganasikshyak under Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan pursuant to Resolution
       No.3358 dated 16.02.2008 (Annexure-1) of School and Mass Education
       Department under which only the disengaged Education Volunteers working
       in EGS Centres have been engaged. Further prayer of the petitioners is for a
       direction/order to opposite parties to engage them as Ganasikshyak in view
       of the engagement of similarly situated Education Volunteers and to declare

                                        3
that the Education Volunteers of A.I.E. Centres are eligible to be considered
for the post of Ganasikshyak in terms of the Resolution of the Government
and to provide all the benefits accrued under the said Scheme as provided to
Education Volunteers of EGS Centres.
2.           In W.P.(C) No.21156 of 2010, prayer has been made to
hold/declare non-inclusion of the Education Volunteers of AIE Centres in
the Resolution dated 16.02.2008 of the School and Mass Education
Department, Government of Odisha for rehabilitating the said Education
Volunteers as Ganasikshyak illegal, unconstitutional and unsustainable in
the eye of law. Further prayer is to modify the resolution dated 16.02.2008
by extending the benefit to all Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres
at par with the similarly situated persons in EGS Centres and to consider
the case of the petitioners for their engagement as Ganasikshyak.
3.           Since issues involved in all the writ petitions are similar in
nature, they are dealt with together in this common judgment.
4.           Petitioners’ case in a nutshell is that they were disengaged as
Education Volunteers in the district of Nuapada. Their appointment was made
by the competent authority in due process of selection. Accordingly, an
agreement was executed between the VEC and the petitioners and they joined
on 14.07.2003 in different AIE Centres as Education Volunteers and were
disengaged during May, 2007. Since the date of engagement, the petitioners
had been discharging their duties till closure of EGS/AIE Scheme. During the
service period they have attended different training programmes for imparting

                                         4
better education to the children as per the direction of the authorities. After
closure of EGS/AIE Scheme, the State Government in School and Mass
Education Department introduced a Resolution dated 16.02.2008, wherein it
is stipulated that the disengaged Education Volunteers will be rehabilitated as
Ganasikshyak under Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan in different schools of the State.
Accordingly, to implement the Scheme, the State Project Director, OPEPA
issued clarification dated 05.04.2008 (Annexure-2) to the various queries of
the Collectors relating to rehabilitation of Education Volunteers, who can be
appointed as Ganasikshyak. It is clarified that in procedure No.1, Education
Volunteers of all EGS/AIE guidelines of the Government of Odisha, in School
and Mass Education Department shall be eligible for rehabilitation as
Ganasikshyaks subject to satisfaction of other norms. As per the instruction
of the Government in School and Mass Education Department, all the District
Offices including the District Office, Nuapada prepared a list of status report
of disengaged Education Volunteers for engagement of Ganasikshyaks and
the petitioners have been placed in the said list. From the said list, Education
Volunteers, who were working in EGS Centres, have been rehabilitated as
Ganasikshyaks but the petitioners were not rehabilitated as Ganasikshyaks
on the ground that they were not working in EGS Centres but working in AIE
Centres. Collector, Nuapada submitted his detailed report to opposite party
No.1 on 09.06.2008 for consideration of petitioners’ case but no action has
been taken till filing of the present writ petitions despite several letters written
to opposite parties 3 and 4. District Project Coordinator, SSA, Nuapada on

                                        5
13.04.2010 had issued a letter to opposite party No.2 furnishing detailed
information along with a list of Education Volunteers, who were working in
AIE Centres and the same is pending with the Government for decision. Since
no action was taken by the authority, petitioner No.1 [in W.P.(C) No.1716 of
2012] filed writ petition bearing W.P.(C) No.11081 of 2011 which was disposed
of on 10.05.2011 directing opposite party No.1 to consider the case of the
petitioner. Pursuant to such direction of this Court, opposite party No.1 vide
impugned order dated 09.12.2011 (Annexure-6) rejected the claim of the
petitioners.
5.           Mr. K.P.Mishra, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
submitted that rejection of petitioner’s claim vide order dated 09.12.2011
under Annexure-6 is illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory and unconstitutional in
nature. Most of the similarly situated Education Volunteers working in AIE
Centres have already been engaged in different districts but petitioners are
ignored illegally. Such action of opposite parties is violative of Articles 14 and
16 of the Constitution of India as the petitioners have fundamental right to get
the said benefit. Sheer discrimination created by opposite parties among one
class of Education Volunteers is not permissible under law. As per the
resolution dated 16.02.2008 of School and Mass Education Department
opposite parties issued engagement order only to Education Volunteers who
were working in EGS Centres whereas the petitioners although working
simultaneously along with Education Volunteers of EGS Centres and
disengaged on the same date, their cases have been ignored. After abolition of

                                       6
NFE Scheme, Government introduced EGS Scheme in the year 2002.
Accordingly, petitioners were engaged as Education Volunteers as per the
order of the authorities. Some of the Education Volunteers were engaged in
EGS Centres and some of Education Volunteers were engaged in AIE Centres.
Ninety-one numbers of AIE Centres were opened in Nuapada district during
the year 2003. Sixty-eight numbers of AIE centres including the petitioners’
centres were closed during May, 2007 and twenty-three AIE Centres were
closed in the year 2008. According to Rules, all the Centres should have been
converted to EGS Centres/Primary Schools. Schools were functioning as per
the formal school time, i.e., 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Petitioners in the mean
time have gathered much experience in the filed of teaching. There is no
difference between Education Volunteers of EGS Centres and AIE Centres.
Both the Centres are functioning under one Scheme by the Government and
they are similar in all respects. They attended different types of programmes
for imparting different education to children as per direction of authorities.
The State Government issued another resolution dated 03.07.2008 on the
basis of which all the retrenched persons would be considered as
Ganasikshyaks. Non-consideration of the case of the petitioners is clear
violation of the Resolution of the Government as well as constitutional
provisions under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
6.           In W.P.(C) No.32955 of 2011, opposite party No.4-District Project
Coordinator, SSA, Nuapada has filed counter affidavit on behalf of opposite
parties 1 to 3. Referring to the said counter affidavit, learned Standing

                                        7
Counsel for School and Mass Education Department submitted that the
claim of the petitioners in the said writ petitions is contradictory to each
other. On the one hand, the petitioners seek direction for their absorption as
Ganasikshyaks as per the Resolution dated 16.02.2008 in School and Mass
Education Department and on the other, they challenge the said Resolution
for non-inclusion of Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres. Therefore,
the writ petition is liable to be dismissed. Petitioners were initially employed
as Education Volunteers in AIE Centres to impart education to children of
migrant people, children engaged in household work, child labour, urban
deprived children, children deprived due to social and religious reasons,
adolescent girls etc. As per the guideline, the activities of the AIE Centres are
meant for mainstreaming the students where even if there is schooling
facility but they are out of school for different reasons. EGS Centres were
established where there was a demand of community and no Primary School
existed within one kilometre radius in the habitation and basing on the
demand of the community EGS Centres were established if at least 25
children are available in the community. Subsequently, the Primary School
is established by the Government in that location by upgrading the EGS
Centres where continuous primary education was provided to the children of
that locality, whereas the AIE Centres were not providing continuous
education. It clearly depends on the availability of pupils. While the matter
stood thus, Government in School and Mass Education Department passed
the resolution dated 16.02.2008 after careful consideration of problems of

                                       8
Education Volunteers under the EGS Scheme and decided to rehabilitate
Education Volunteers in EGS Centres who have been disengaged or facing
disengagement under the EGS Scheme as Ganasikshyak under Sarba
Sikshya Abhiyan. But the aforesaid resolution did not contemplate inclusion
of Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres. It was exclusively meant for
Education Volunteers working in EGS Centres and accordingly the present
petitioners who continued as Education Volunteers in the AIE Centres till
their closure cannot be absorbed as Ganasikshyaks in accordance with the
above said Resolution.
7.          On     the  rival  contentions,   the    questions   that   fall for
consideration by this Court are as follow:-
       (i)  Whether    benefit  provided    under    Resolution   dated
            16.02.2008 to Education Volunteers working in EGS
            Centres    should    be   extended    to   the   Education
            Volunteers working in AIE Centres?
       (ii) Whether     opposite    party   No.1-Commissioner-cum-
            Secretary, School and Mass Education Department is
            justified to hold that petitioners who are working as
            Education Volunteers in AIE Centres are not entitled to
            be engaged as Ganasikshyak in terms of Resolution
            No.3358/SME dated 16.02.2008 of School and Mass
            Education     Department     according    to   which   only
            Education Volunteers working in EGS Centres are to be
            rehabilitated as Ganasikshyaks under Sarba Sikshya
            Abhiyan?

                                     9
8.           Since both the questions are inter-linked, they are dealt with
together.
9.           Undisputed facts are that the petitioners were appointed as
Education Volunteers in AIE Centres after due process of selection and
agreements were executed between the VEC and the petitioners. They were
engaged on 14.07.2003 in different AIE centres as Education Volunteers and
disengaged in May, 2007. They have attended different programmes for
imparting different education to the children as per the direction of the
authorities.  The   Resolution  dated  16.02.2008,    for  the    purpose  of
universalization of Elementary Education through EGS Scheme, which is an
integral part of Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan, was operationalized in Odisha from
the year 2001-02. Due to upgradation of EGS Centres to regular Schools and
for various reasons, the Education Volunteers engaged in such EGS Centres
have been disengaged. Government of Odisha after careful consideration of
the   Education   Guarantee   Scheme   decided   to  rehabilitate  Education
Volunteers working in EGS Centres, who have been disengaged or facing
disengagement under the EGS Scheme. As per the said Scheme, such
disengaged Education Volunteers would be rehabilitated as Gana Sikshyaks
under Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan. Pursuant to such Resolution, opposite parties
are rehabilitating only Education Volunteers working in EGS Centres and
they are not absorbing Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres.
Petitioners’ case is that as per EGS/AIE guideline, Education Volunteers
were engaged in the State in both the Centres, i.e., EGS Centres and AIE

                                      10
Centres. Education Volunteers were working in both the Centres with same
remuneration and terms and conditions of service. Both AIE/EGS Centres
are Government Centres opened as per the same guideline and created by
one resolution from the beginning till closure of the Scheme. The source of
recruitment is one. Therefore, they cannot be treated differently. As it
appears, non-inclusion of Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres for
engagement as Ganasikshyak under Sarba Sikshya Abhiyan in the
Resolution dated 16.02.2008 is an omission. Otherwise also, non-inclusion
of all the Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres in Resolution dated
16.02.2008 amounts to violation of rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and
16 of the Constitution of India. The sole contention of opposite parties is that
since, according to Resolution dated 16.02.2008, the disengaged Education
Volunteers working in EGS Centres are only to be rehabilitated, the case of
Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres cannot be considered.
10.          At this juncture, it is necessary to refer to letter dated
05.04.2008 (Annexure-2) addressed by State Project Director, OPEPA to
Commissioner-cum-Secretary to Government, School and Mass Education
Department, Odisha. In the said letter referring to Resolution No.3358/SME
dated 16.02.2008, several suggestions have been given for rehabilitation of
Education Volunteers of erstwhile EGS Centres. As per Procedure-1,
Education Volunteers of all EGS Centres approved and operationalised as per
the norms of EGS/AIE Guidelines of Government of Odisha, School and Mass
Education Department shall be eligible for rehabilitation as Gana Sikshyak

                                       11
subject to satisfaction of other norms. Thus in Procedure-1, it was suggested
that the Education Volunteers working in all EGS Centres approved and
operationalised as per the norms of EGS/AIE Guidelines shall be eligible for
rehabilitation   as  Ganasikshyak.    As   per  paragraph-3   of  letter  dated
09.06.2008 (Annexure-4) written by Collector-cum-Chairperson, DPEP/SSA,
Nuapada to the Under Secretary to Government, School and Mass Education
Department, Odisha, the list of selected Education Volunteers, who were
engaged in AIE Centres, was duly approved by District EGS Committee.
11.           As per paragraph 2 of letter dated 13.04.2010 issued by the
District Project Coordinator, SSA, Nuapada to the Assistant Director (Access),
OPEPA, Bhubaneswar the condition of engagement of Education Volunteers
of AIE centres is the same as Education Volunteers of EGS Centres. They
were given same remuneration as EVs of EGS Centres. All AIE Centres were
functioning as per the formal School time.
12.           The stand that similarly situated persons in other districts have
been engaged as Ganasikshyaks under SSA is not disputed by opposite
parties. It is nobody’s case that both Centres are not functioning under the
same Scheme. It is also not disputed that their process of recruitment and
rehabilitation etc. are same. Appointment was made as per the decision
taken by the competent authority. Both Education Volunteers working in
EGS/AIE Centres were disengaged pursuant to Resolution dated 16.02.2008.
It appears that the Government after careful consideration of the case of the
Education Volunteers under EGS Scheme decided to rehabilitate them in

                                       12
EGS Centres, who have been disengaged or facing disengagement under EGS
Scheme. It is not understood as to when the Education Volunteers working in
EGS Centres as well as AIE Centres were disengaged and they were facing
problems as to why Government has issued Resolution dated 16.02.2008
only considering the case of Education Volunteers working in EGS Centres
who have been disengaged but did not consider the case of Education
Volunteers working in AIE Centres. In the Counter, no valid reason has been
assigned as to why the case of Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres
was not considered. The only stand taken by the opposite party No.1-
Commissioner-cum-Secretary, School and Mass Education Department,
Odisha, Bhubaneswar is that in view of Resolution dated 16.02.2008, the
case of Education Volunteers working in AIE Centres could not be
considered. Mr.Pandey has not satisfactorily met the allegation of the
petitioners that the action of opposite parties is a clear case of discrimination
and violates the constitutional mandates of equality enshrined in Articles 14
and 16 of the Constitution of India.
13.          In the present case, no valid and cogent reason has been
assigned by learned Standing Counsel to justify the Resolution dated
16.02.2008 passed by the Government of Odisha in School and Mass
Education     Department    only   in   rehabilitating   disengaged    Education
Volunteers working under EGS Centres and ignoring the case of similarly
situated persons in AIE Centres.

                                               13
  14.               The fact of the case decided by this Court on 03.08.2010 in W.P.
  (C) No. 20566 of 2009 is not similar to the fact of the present case. Apart
  from that, there is hardly any detailed discussion about the fact and
  scenario involved in the aforesaid cases. Therefore, the decision in that case
  is not applicable to the case of the present petitioners.
  15.               In the fact situation, this Court directs the State Government to
  consider the matter afresh and pass appropriate order within a period of two
  months from today taking into account various stands taken by the
  petitioners and observations of this Court made above and the fact that
  different yardsticks have been followed in different districts.
  16.               So far the order passed under Annexure-6, Opposite party No.1
  only followed the resolution dated 16.02.2008 passed by the Government,
  and rejected the representations of the petitioners. Therefore, in the
  circumstances, the order passed by opposite party No.1 (Annexure-6) is
  quashed and he is directed to reconsider the case of the petitioners in the
  light of the decision that would be taken by the Government pursuant to this
  judgment.
  17.               In the result, the Writ Petitions are allowed with aforesaid
  observation/directions.
