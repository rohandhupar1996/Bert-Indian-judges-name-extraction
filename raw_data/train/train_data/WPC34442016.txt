                  THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE NELSON SAILO
For the Petitioners:        Mr. P.K. Goswami          …… Advocate.
For the respondents:       Ms. A. Verma,    ..... SC, P & R D Department.
Date of Hearing and Judgment :        12th June, 2017
                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
        Heard Mr. P.K. Goswami, the learned counsel for the petitioners as well
as Ms. A. Verma, the learned Standing Counsel, Panchayat and Rural
Development Department, for the respondent Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 and Mr. P.
Nayak, the learned Standing Counsel, Finance Department, for the respondent
Nos. 6, 7 and 8. The respondent No.1 is represented by the learned Government
Advocate, Assam.
2]     The petitioner No.1 is a registered association under the Trade Union Act,
1926, and the petitioner Nos. 2 and 3 are the President and the Secretary of the
Association. The members of the petitioners’ association are casual employees as
Grade-III and Grade-IV engaged staff against the vacant post and as per the
staffing pattern which was introduced by the Assam Panchayat Act, 1986, which
was later endorsed by the Assam Panchayat (Administrative) Rules, 2002, which
includes the posts of Tax Collectors, Road Moharar, Peon, Chowkidar and Driver
in the Panchayat Department of the Government of Assam. They were engaged
from a period between the year 1992 to 2006 as per the requirement of Zila
Parisad, Gaon Panchayat and Anchalik Panchayat by adopting resolutions in their
respective committees. Some of the employees of the petitioners’ association
WP(C) No.3444 of 2016

                                             3
were engaged by the Panchayat Local Bodies prior to the publication of the
Assam (Administrative) Rules, 2002 while others as per the staffing pattern
prescribed by the aforesaid Rules.
3]        On 25.01.2012, the State Government decided to pay the casual workers
engaged in different Panchayat Raj Institutions (in short PRIs) fixed wages at the
rate of 4500/- per month after due verification and after furnishing of utilization
certificate. While the members of the petitioners’ association were paid the said
fixed amount for some time, they were, however, not paid for the period from
01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016. Consequently, the petitioner No.3 submitted
representations to the Commissioner, the Panchayat and Rural Department on
13.11.2015 and 16.11.2015, but, however, there was no response from the
respondent authorities.
4]         The Additional Secretary to the Government of Assam, Panchayat and
Rural Development Department on 29.02.2016 (Annexure-H) in response to the
assessment of required fund for fixed wages for the casual workers engaged in
different PRIs and the Development Blocks for the period from 01.04.2015 to
31.03.2016 wrote to the Commissioner Panchayat and Rural Development,
Assam, to take necessary action in terms of the endorsement of the Finance
Department. The endorsement of the Finance Department is reproduced herein
below:
             “Your endorsement at prepage.
               P & RD Department is requested to issue instruction to concerned
         PRIs to pay wages @ Rs.4500/- P.M. (to the individual bank accounts of
         the casual workers by way of ECS) for the period 01.04.2015 to
         31.03.2016 to the existing casual workers against the total of 1812
         numbers of casual workers as per P & RD Department letter

                                         4
5]        Since the respondent authorities failed to take any action despite the
communication dated 29.02.2016, the petitioner No.3 again on 29.04.2016
submitted a representation to the Additional Chief Secretary to the Government
of Assam, Panchayat and Rural Development Department, requesting for
necessary action and direction to the concerned PRI’s to make payment of fixed
wages of the casual workers for the period from 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016.
However, as the same was not considered and the casual workers having
remained unpaid, the petitioners have filed the instant writ petition.
6]       The respondent No.3 in response to the writ petition filed an affidavit-in-
opposition on 01.11.2016 contending, inter alia, that the members of the
petitioners’ association were engaged as casual workers by the Panchayat Raj
Institution (PRIs) without following the provisions of the Assam Panchayat Act,
1994 and the Assam Panchayat (Administrative) Rules, 2002. However, the
Panchayat and Rural Development Department sought the instructions of the
Finance Department with regard to the payment of fixed wages and casual
workers and in reply, the Finance (Economic Affairs) Department informed that
the PRIs are treated as 3rd tire Local Self Government in the federal structure in
the Indian Union and as the concerned Local Self Government Institution had
engaged casual fixed pay employees at different tires of PRIs at their own
direction, therefore, the local bodies may be asked to clear the liabilities, if any,
from their own resources like Central Finance Commission Award, State Finance
Commission Award or their own revenue collecting resources. Such instructions
was made vide letter under Memo No.FEA (SFC) 49/2009/pt75 dated 17.06.2016.
7]          The respondent No.3 also contended that as per the decision in the
meeting held on 07.12.2015 under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Panchayat
and Rural Development Department, it was decided that the wages of the casual
workers be met from the grants under the 5th State Finance Commission and for
which the proposal be made to the Finance Department. Further, as per the
instructions given by the Finance Department, the proposal for sanction fund
WP(C) No.3444 of 2016

                                          5
under the non-salary component of the 5th State Finance Commission Award
during the year 2016-17, a proposal was submitted to the State Government in
the Panchayat and Rural Development Department for sanction of the amount
therein in order to pay the engaged casual workers. However, due to lack of
fund, the members of the petitioners’ association could not be paid their salaries.
8]      The respondent No.3 also filed an additional affidavit on 05.04.2017 to
bring on record the subsequent development in the case to content that although
the Panchayat and Rural Development was asked to issue instructions to the
concerned PRIs to pay wages for the engaged casual workers as was instructed
vide communication dated 29.02.2016. However, by the time, the same was
received, the operational period of the 13th Finance Commission had already
expired and the grants were exhausted. Furthermore, the 14th Finance
Commission do not permit utilization of fund towards salaries/honorarium of
existing employees, permanent and contract which would include wages to
causal workers. It is also contended that the Panchayat and Rural Development
Department submitted a list of 3670 casual workers to the Finance Department
on 21.09.2016 for judicious consideration for payment of monthly wages to
causal workers. In the meeting held on 22.09.2016 on the matter of job security
and retiral benefits it was observed that such benefits can be provided to causal
workers working continuously for more than 10 years with Government but not
against sanctioned posts cover the causal workers engaged in various Panchayat
Raj Institutions (PRIs). However, due the non-availability of fund and also due to
non-availability of a specific provision for payment of the casual employees, the
respondent concerned is not in a position to pay the claimed fixed pay.
9]      Mr. P.K. Goswami, the learned counsel for the petitioners, submits that as
was mentioned earlier, the same subject matter was dealt by a          co-ordinate
bench of this Court in WP(C) No.5135 of 2015 and WP(C) No.6170 of 2014 filed
by the petitioner association. He submits that the same has been disposed of
vide a common judgment and order dated 26.05.2017. The writ petitions were
disposed of with a direction to the respondent authorities to take recourse to the
WP(C) No.3444 of 2016

                                         6
provisions of the Assam Panchayat Employees (Provincialisation) Act, 1999 to
provincialise the services of the remaining employees of the Panchayats.
However, if the same was not done, the remaining numbers of staff as per the
staffing pattern should be filled up by resolving the recruitment under Section
140(1) of the Assam Panchayat Act, 1944, by constituting District Selection
Committees in the Panchayat and Rural Development Department. Till such
decision, the members of the petitioners’ association are to be paid fix wages i.e.
Rs.4,500/- per month. Mr. P.K. Goswami has produced a copy of the said
judgment and order dated 26.05.2017.
10]         Ms. A. Verma, the learned counsel for the respondents on the other
hand submits that fund received under the 14th Finance Commission does not
contain the salary component. She submits that the expenditure on candidates
including the honorarium TA, DA and other wages of existing employees whether
permanent or contractual are excluded from the utilization of the fund.
Therefore, the respondents cannot utilize the fund received from the 14th Finance
Commission for paying the wages of the petitioners’ association.
11]           I have considered the rival submissions of the parties as well as
perused the materials available on record.
12]          On perusal of the judgment and order dated 26.05.2017 passed in
WP(C) No.5135 of 205 and WP(C) No.6170 of 2014, it can be seen that the case
of the members of the petitioners’ association has been exhaustively dealt with
by this Court. The Court has taken into account the decision and approval of the
State Government for payment of fixed wages @ Rs.4,500/- per month to the
1812 numbers of casual workers on 25.01.2012 while also taking into account
Section 3 of the Assam Panchayat Employees (Provincialisation) Act, 1999, does
not visualize any classification or categorization of employee of the Panchayats
but covers all employees of Panchayats and they would be deemed to have been
provincialised on and from the appropriate date. Therefore, the Court upon
considering the fact that the Commissioner, Panchayat and Rural Development
WP(C) No.3444 of 2016

                                         7
had written to the Additional Chief Secretary to the Government of Assam,
Panchayat and Rural Development Department on 18.12.2014 for creation of
about 3,000 posts at different levels of the Panchayat Raj Insitutitons (PRIs) on
the basis of recommended staffing pattern, it was observed that if such posts
were created, the State Government can take recourse to the provision of the
Assam Panchayat Employees (Provincialisation) Act, 1999 to provincialise the
services of all the remaining employees of the Panchayats which would include
the members of the petitioners’ association. If the same does not materialise and
the Government takes a policy decision not to redeploy the excess staff or
decides on limited redeployment, the remaining could be filed up by resorting to
recruitment under Section 140 (1) of the Assam Panchayat Act, 1944 by
constituting of District Selection Committee. While directing such exercise to be
completed within a period of 6 (six) months from receipt of the order, it was also
directed the wages of the members of the petitioners’ association employed on
casual basis would continue to      be paid their fixed wages @ Rs.4,500/- per
month. Although, the 2 (two) cases primarily concern the absorption of the
members of the petitioners’ association but, nevertheless, the regular payment of
monthly fixed wages has also been accounted for. Therefore, under the
circumstance, the decision rendered on 26.05.2017 supports the cause of the
members of the petitioners’ association in the instant case as well I find no
reason to differ to the same.
13]        Considering the fact that the members of the petitioners’ association
have rendered their services and paid monthly fixed wages of Rs.4,500/-,
pursuant to the decision taken on 25.01.2012 and also taking into consideration
the decision taken in the meeting minutes dated 07.12.2015 and the
endorsement of the Finance Department reproduced in the communication dated
29.02.2016, I am of the considered opinion that the respondent authorities are
bound to pay the monthly fixed wages of the members of the petitioners’
association for the period between 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016. It would be
necessary for the State respondents to arrange the fund so required and the
contention of the respondents about impermissibility of utilization the fund from
WP(C) No.3444 of 2016

                                           8
the 14th Finance Commission cannot come in the way. Having opined thus, the
writ petition is disposed of by directing the respondent authorities to pay the
monthly fixed wages of the members of the petitioners’ association for the period
between 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016 within a period of 3 (three) months from the
date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
14]        With the above observations and directions, the writ petition stands
disposed of. No cost.
                                                                      JUDGE
