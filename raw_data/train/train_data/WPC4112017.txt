        Heard Mr. R. S. Chouhan, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner as
well as Mr. M.R. Adhikary, the learned Government Advocate appearing for all
the respondents (Environment and Forest Department).
2.      Mr. M.R. Adhikary submits that he has received instructions in the matter
and he may be given some to file affidavit-in-opposition. However, considering
the nature of controversy raised by the writ petitioner, the Court is of the
considered opinion that the writ petition is disposed of with certain direction.
3.      The case of the petitioner is that he was appointed as constable in the
establishment of the respondent No. 4 (Assam Forest Protection Force) on
08.02.2011. On such appointment, the petitioner joined his service but he was
discharged from his service vide order dated 16.02.2012 (Annexure-7) on the
ground that he was found unfit to discharge his duties by the Medical Board. The
representation of the petitioner against the order of discharge having not been
considered, the petitioner approached this Court by filing WP(C) 2708/10 which
came to be disposed vide order dated 12.12.2013 (Annexure-3). This Court upon
finding the writ petition to be premature on account of the pending appeal filed
by the petitioner, disposed of the writ petition directing the authorities to
consider and dispose of the petitioner’s appeal within 2 (two) months from the
date of receipt of a copy of the order. The respondent authorities were
consequently persuaded to comply with the direction passed by this Court on
12.12.2013 after the writ petitioner filed contempt petition. The order of
compliance by disposing the appeal of the petitioner was passed on 11.11.2014
(Annexure-12), whereby, the petitioner upon being found to be fit was allowed
                                                                          Page 2 of 3

                                                                        WP(C) 411/2017
to resume his duties and he was asked to complete the basic mandatory training
successfully. The petitioner thereafter join his duties on 20.11.2014 and
successfully completed the basic training.
4.       The basic claim of the petitioner in the instant petition is for his arrear
salary with effect from the date he was discharged from service i.e. 16.02.2012
upto the date he joined back his service i.e 20.11.2014. The petitioner by filing
his representation on 10.03.2015 before the respondent No. 1 seeking relief, but,
however, his representation having not been considered, the petitioner is again
before this Court.
5.       Considering the case projected by the writ petitioner that he was in fact
medically fit in between the examination done by the Medical Board on
27.12.2011 and 11.09.2014, this Court is of the considered opinion that the
respondent authorities should examine the same and take a decision to the claim
of the petitioner as projected vide his representation dated 10.03.2015.
6.       In that view of the matter the writ petition is disposed of with a direction
to the respondent No. 1 to consider the representation of the petitioner dated
10.03.2015 within a period of 2 (two) months from the date of receipt of
certified copy of this order. Liberty is granted to the petitioner to substantiate the
grounds taken in his representation before the authority concerned.
7.       With the above observations and directions, the writ petition stands
disposed of. No. cost.
