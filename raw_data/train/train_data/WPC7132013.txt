                            W.P.(C) No. 713 of 2013
                                          BEFORE
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
31.07.2017
            Heard Mr. B. Chakraborty, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard
    Mr. J.I. Borbhuiya, learned Standing Counsel, Public Health Engineering
    Department, for Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 and Mr. N. Goswami, learned
    Government Advocate, Assam, for the Respondent No.4.
    2.      The father of the petitioner, Girish Chandra Seal was serving as regular
    Grade-IV (Khalasi) in the Office of the Executive       Engineer, Public Health
    Engineering, Dhubri Division, Dhubri, sole bread earner of the family, who died-
    in-harness on 16.11.1997 leaving his wife and five children, including the
    petitioner. The petitioner, on 06.03.1998, submitted an application before the
    Respondent No.3, the Executive Engineer, PHE, Dhubri, for his compassionate
    appointment. Though the said Executive Engineer, PHE, Division, forwarded
    the application of the petitioner to the Chief Engineer, PHE, Guwahati, in May,
    1999 informing him about the availability of two vacancies, but, his case was
    not considered by the authorities concerned, rather considered the case of one
    Sikha Ghosh, whose husband expired on 07.04.1999 and appointed her as
    Chowkidar in the Office of the Executive Engineer, Public Health Engineering,
    Dhubri Division, Dhubri. The petitioner being aggrieved, preferred a writ
    petition before this Court being W.P.(C) No.3036 of 2003 claiming his
    compassionate appointment         which was disposed of by this Court on
    29.04.2003 directing the State respondent to consider the case of the petitioner
    as per the government policy within a period of three months. Since the order
    of this Court dated 29.04.2003 was not complied, the petitioner preferred a
    contempt proceeding being COP(C) No.135/2004 and in the said proceeding,
    the respondent/contemnors submitted that pursuant to the order of this Court
    passed in the Case of Achyut R anjan Das Vs. State of Assam and other
    WP(C) No. 713 of 2013                                             Page 1 of 4

connected case, reported in 2006 (4) GLT 674 , the case of the petitioner was
placed before the District Level Committee for compassionate appointment
Dhubri, the Respondent No.4 belatedly, and that due to oversight his case was
not placed in the said DLC earlier. Ultimately, the case of the petitioner was
placed before the DLC, Dhubri on 16.9.2009. His case could not be considered
by the said DLC due to non-availability of required vacancies. Subsequent to
that the petitioner’s case was placed before the DLC, Dhubri on 14.06.2010,
and the DLC Dhubri rejected the case of the petitioner holding that his case is
pending for more than two years and that he filed his application after more
than three months. The respondents placed these facts before the Court in said
Contempt Case No.135/2004 and due to non-consideration of the case of the
petitioner, by order dated 04.11.2011, this Court closed the said contempt
proceeding granting liberty to the petitioner to file writ petition, if any.
3.      Learned counsel for the petitioner Mr. B. Chakraborty has referred to the
cases of Achyut R anjan Das (Supra), Ajit Pator Vs. State of Assam ,
reported in 2009 (3) GLT 306 and Foziron Nessa Vs. State of Assam and
others , reported on 2010(4) GLT 340 and submitted that the respondents
have not considered the case of the petitioner in proper manner disregarding
his case for compassionate appointment.
4.      The Respondent No.4, DLC, Dhubri filed an affidavit in the matter and
stated that the meeting for Compassionate appointment in the Dhubri District
was held on 23.03.2007 after disposal of the petitioner’s Writ Petition being
W.P.(C) No.3036 of 2003 and in the said meeting, the Executive Engineer, PHE,
Dhubri did not place any proposal for compassionate appointment. Thereafter,
the second meeting of DLC, Dhubri was held on 15.7.2008 but, the petitioner’s
case could not be considered due to paucity of vacancies. Though, another
meeting of the DLC, Dhubri was held on 31.10.2008, but as it was submitted by
the Executive Engineer, PHE, as the matter of compassionate appointment was
subjudiced, the case of the petitioner could not be considered. Again in the
meeting of DLC, Dhubri, held on 16.9.2009, the DLC, Dhubri did not place any
WP(C) No. 713 of 2013                                                   Page 2 of 4

proposal for compassionate appointment and, ultimately, only on 14.6.2010, the
case of the petitioner was placed before the DLC, Dhubri. And, as at point of
time, the case of the petitioner for his compassionate appointment does not
come under consideration under the scheme of compassionate appointment, as
was in force at that point of time, his case could not be considered.
5.     In the case of Achyut R anjan Das (supra), this Court have held that
with regard to compassionate appointment, the authorities have to consider all
pending applications against existing available vacancies within a period of four
months as an one time measure and with regard to subsequent to the said
judgment two years limitation period has been laid down with other
consideration. This position has been further clarified in the case of Ajit Pator
(supra) that pending cases have to be considered once as one time measure
and the period of limitation of two years laid down in new case subsequent to
the case of Achyut R anjan Das (supra). Further, in the case of Foziron
Nessa (supra), this Court have held that submission of application for
compassionate appointment within a period of three months shall not have
retrospective effect and it should be considered to be twelve months from the
date of death of government employee, who is the bread earner of the family
and such cases of compassionate appointment should be considered on need
basis upon comparative assessment and not on seniority claim.
6.     Since the case of the petitioner was not duly considered by the DLC,
Dhubri, and rejected his claim in the meeting held on 14.6.2010, the same is
hereby set aside and quashed.
7.     The petitioner shall submit a certified copy of this order along with a
representation before the Executive Engineer, PHE, Dhubri, the respondent
No.3, and the respondent No.3 shall place the case of the petitioner in the next
DLC meeting for compassionate appointment of Dhubri. In the event of such
submission of case of the petitioner for his compassionate appointment, the
DLC, Dhubri, shall consider his case in terms of the decisions in the case of
WP(C) No. 713 of 2013                                              Page 3 of 4

Achyut R anjan Das, Ajit Pator and Foziron Nessa (supra) and shall pass
appropriate orders in accordance with law intimating the petitioner regarding its
decision in the said matter.
8.      With the aforesaid observation, this petition stands disposed of.
                                                              JUDGE
