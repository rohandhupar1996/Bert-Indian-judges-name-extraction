                          W.P.(C) No. 1216 of 2009
                                       BEFORE
             HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
31.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Dulal Chandra Kath Hazarika, learned counsel for the
    petitioner and Mr. M Khataniar, learned Govt. Advocate for the respondent
    Nos.1 to 6.
    2.       The petitioner was serving as an AB (Armed Branch) Constable in
    Sonitpur DEF since 09.12.1987. As he suffered from mental disorder and
    reported mentally sick on 07.01.2000, he was under treatment in the
    Tezpur Police Hospital for a period from 07.01.2000 to 10.01.2000. But as
    he was not cured, by the reference letter dated 07.01.2000 the Medical
    Officer of said Tezpur Police Hospital referred him to the Lokapriya
    Gopinath Bardoloi Mental Hospital, Tezpur, where the petitioner underwent
    treatment in said Mental Hospital since 11.01.2000 till 23.08.2003 and it is
    submitted that even thereafter, the petitioner’s treatment is ongoing.
    3.       While the petitioner was undergoing treatment for his mental
    illness, it is alleged that he had also suffered from tuberculosis and had
    undergone treatment during 12.03.2003 to 18.08.2007 during the period
    when the treatment of his mental illness was also not complete. The
    petitioner stated that he was served with a show-cause notice dated
    10.04.2007 asking him to reply for his absence from service since
    22.11.2000 to 10.04.2007 without any permission from the competent
    authority, which tantamount to gross negligence of duty and indiscipline, a
    conduct rendering him unfit to be retained in the discipline force and
    accordingly, he was charged with gross negligence of duty and indiscipline
    conduct. By the said show cause dated 10.04.2007, the petitioner was also
    directed to submit his written statement in defence within a period of 10
    (ten) days from the date of said communication provided he does not
    intend to inspect the documents relating to the issues involved in the said
    WP(C) No. 1216 of 2009                                           Page 1 of 6

proceedings and further, directed him that in case he wants to inspect
those documents he should write to the issuing authority i.e. the
Superintendent of Police, Sonitpur, Tezpur within a period of seven days
from the date of receipt of said notice. Along with the said show cause
notice the petitioner was also served with statement of allegations against
him as well as the list of witnesses and the list of documents to be
executed in the proceeding.
4.      To the said show cause notice dated 10.04.2007, the petitioner
submitted his reply on 04.06.2007 and his reply being not found
satisfactory, the disciplinary authority passed the necessary order on
04.06.2007 itself directing to enquire into the allegations levelled against
the petitioner appointing one Sri A.K. Sarma, Deputy Superintendent of
Police, Sonitpur, Tezpur as Enquiry Officer and Sri Makhan Phukan, ABI,
Sonitpur, Tezpur as Presenting Officer of the case. During the enquiry, four
witnesses on behalf of the prosecution were examined whereas the
petitioner produced one defence witness. The enquiry officer submitted his
report on 11.07.2007. The disciplinary authority accepted the said enquiry
report submitted by the Enquiry Officer in the disciplinary proceeding
No.6/2007 that was drawn against the petitioner wherein the enquiry
officer found the period of absence of the petitioner from 22.11.2000 to
23.03.2007 to be unauthorized and that the petitioner’s residence being
within a radius of one kilometer from the police reserve, his plea of inability
to resume duty on domestic problems as shown by the petitioner was
found to be unreasonable and it was held that the same amounts to gross
negligence of duty.
5.      The disciplinary authority accepted the said enquiry report dated
11.07.2007 and while forwarding the same to the petitioner, the said
authority on 17.7.2007 also issued second show cause notice to him asking
the petitioner to show cause within ten days of receipt of the same as to
why he should not be penalized under Rule 66 of the Assam Police Manual
Part III to which the petitioner submitted his reply within time.
WP(C) No. 1216 of 2009                                            Page 2 of 6

6.      As the petitioner sought for a personal hearing, he was personally
heard by the Disciplinary authority on 04.08.2007. But finding the second
show cause reply being not satisfactory and even during his personal
hearing, he failed to satisfactorily explain the reasons for his unauthorised
absence from duty for more than six years, as such the disciplinary
authority by his order dated 04.08.2007 dismissed the petitioner from
service with immediate effect treating the period of his unauthorized
absence as on leave without pay and the said order was communicated to
the petitioner on 06.08.2007.
7.      The petitioner, thereafter, preferred an appeal before the Deputy
Inspector General of Police, Northern Range, Sonitpur, Tezpur against the
said order of his dismissal order dated 06.08.2007. The appellate authority
after verifying the records found that the petitioner was a habitual
absentee from duty and he used to remain absent in service without any
permission from the competent authority or without any valid reason, for
which he was awarded several punishments prior to his dismissal from
service on 06.08.2007. The Appellate authority also found that for such
absence in his duty, the petitioner was earlier awarded punishments like
leave without pay for thirteen days on four occasions, warning on two
occasions, punishment drill for three times and was severely reprimanded
on four occasions. The said Appellate authority also considered that out of
12 years 11 months 13 days of his service from the date of his
appointment, the said delinquent had availed various leaves like HL, EL on
medical grounds, T.B., Special Leave, H.L. without pay etc. for a period of
3 years 5 months and 27 days. The appellate authority for all those
reasons, by his order dated 06.08.2008 found the dismissal of service of
the petitioner as valid due to his unauthorised absence from duty for more
than six years.
8.      Being aggrieved with such dismissal order dated 06.08.2007 passed
by the disciplinary authority, i.e. the Superintendent of Police, Sonitpur,
Tezpur and upheld by the appellate authority, i.e. the Deputy Inspector
WP(C) No. 1216 of 2009                                            Page 3 of 6

general of Police, Northern Range, Assam, Tezpur on 06.08.2008, the
petitioner has preferred this writ petition.
9.      The contention of the petitioner herein is that the respondent No.4
i.e. the Enquiry Officer did not verify the official records with regard to the
period of treatment undergone by him and that he had been referred to
LGB Mental Hospital for treatment of his mental disorder by the medical
officer of Tezpur Police Hospital itself. Relying on a decision reported in
2007 (2) GLT 959 in the case of State Bank of India and others -Vs- Ashok
Kumar Das, the petitioner submitted that the respondent authority cannot
deny the fact that he had been suffering from mental disorder and that a
person suffering from mental illness cannot be said to have been put to
notice and such notice may be validly served on a person who may have
been appointed as guardian of the mentally sick person as such person
(mentally sick) would not know as to what he was doing and/or what was
being done to him. For the reasons aforesaid, the petitioner submitted that
the impugned order of dismissal from service dated 06.08.2007 issued by
the Superintendent of Police, Sonitpur, Tezpur as well as the appellate
order dated 06.08.2008 passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police,
Sonitpur, Tezpur should be set aside and quashed being unjust, unfair and
arbitrary and not in accordance with the procedure laid down by this Court
in respect of departmental proceeding against the person suffering from
mental disorder. The petitioner has also placed reliance on the judgment of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Shri Bhagawan Lal Arya -Vs-
Commissioner of Police, Delhi and ors. reported in (2004) 4 SCC 560.
10.     The respondent No.5, the Superintendent of Police, Sonitpur,
Tezpur filed an affidavit in the matter and gave a long list of orders by
which the petitioner during his tenure in service was imposed with
punishments due to his unauthorized absence prior to the impugned order
of dismissal dated 06.08.2007. The respondent No.5 also stated that even
after expiry of period of rest as advised by the police doctor, the petitioner
instead of resuming his duty remained absent in service in an unauthorised
WP(C) No. 1216 of 2009                                              Page 4 of 6

manner and even his whereabouts were not known. It is also submitted
that the petitioner or any one from his family did not inform the authority
about his inabilities, if any, to resume duty despite the fact that his home is
located within a radius of one kilometer away from the police reserve at
Tezpur. Respondent No. 5 also submitted that the petitioner was advised
for rest by the police doctor w.e.f. 28.4.2000 to 21.11.2000 as per the
advice prescribed by the doctors of the LGB Mental Hospital, Tezpur. It has
also been placed before the Court that the said petitioner during the
enquiry clearly stated that he could not resume duty due to domestic
trouble without stating anything that he was undergoing treatment for his
mental illness even after completion of the period of rest up to 21.11.2000,
as advised by the police doctor and that the petitioner himself admitted
that he was cured of his mental illness before his mother’s death that
occurred in the year 2001.
11.      The said respondent No.5 also submitted that only after perusal of
the finding of the concerned enquiry officer in the disciplinary proceeding
No. 6/2007 drawn up against the petitioner, by the impugned order dated
06.08.2007 the petitioner was dismissed from service for his unauthorised
absence from duty continuously for more than six years, that too, after
giving him a personal hearing. The said respondent No. 5 further submitted
that even during his personal hearing, the petitioner failed to explain
satisfactorily the reasons for his unauthorized absence from duty for the
aforesaid period.
12.      It is seen from the records of the case that the petitioner before the
disciplinary authority on 09.07.2007 clearly stated that due to illness of his
mother, he had to engage himself in domestic works and after the expiry of
his mother, he was the only man to run the family and also faced with case
of land dispute, the judgment of which was in his favour for which his
neighbours gave him lots of troubles that led him to his mental imbalance.
From the records it is also seen that the petitioner did not place any
medical certificate(s) regarding his mental illness after 21.11.2000 and on
WP(C) No. 1216 of 2009                                             Page 5 of 6

being enquired, he submitted that he had no such medical certificate of
undergoing treatment of his mental illness after 21.11.2000.
13.      It is also seen from the records of the case that the defence witness
on behalf of the petitioner did not disclose any thing regarding mental
illness of the petitioner except that as the petitioner’s mother suffered from
stroke    due to pressure, he had to look after her from 1997-98 till her
death in 2000/2001.
14.      From the records it is seen that after 21.11.2000, the date when
prescribed rest period was over, the petitioner during the enquiry placed
various domestic problems as the reasons that compelled him to remain
absent from his duty but neither he placed anything regarding continuous
treatment of his mental illness after 21.11.2000 nor he stated about his
such mental illness.
15.      The Court on perusal of the records did not find any flaws in the
departmental proceeding conducted against the petitioner. On the other
hand, it is seen that the disciplinary authority even after issuing second
show cause notice to him, after receiving his replay, at his request also
gave him a personal hearing before issuing the dismissal order dated
04.08.2007 communicated on 06.08.2007.           Though petitioner raised the
issue of his mental illness but there is nothing on record regarding such
mental illness of the petitioner after 21.11.2000, after the period of his rest
for such illness expired.
16.      Accordingly, being devoid of merit, this petition stands dismissed.
                                                               JUDGE
