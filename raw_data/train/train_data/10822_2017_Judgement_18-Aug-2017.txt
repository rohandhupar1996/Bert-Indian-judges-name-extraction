                                       CIVIL APPEAL NO. 10617 OF 2017

                       S.V. SEETHA DEVI                                    APPELLANT(S)
                                                       VERSUS
                       STATE OF KERALA & ORS.                              RESPONDENT(S)

                            Leave granted.
                        2.  In the nature of order we propose to pass in this
                        appeal,  it    is   not   necessary   to   issue   notice   to   the
                        respondents.
                        3.  Though    we   are  not   inclined   to   interfere   with   the
                        impugned order, as far as the relief regarding salary for
                        the period the appellant has worked is concerned, we are
                        of the view that it would be just proper and equitable to
                        pay the salary to the appellant.
                        4.  Therefore,     the   judgment  under   challenge   will    stand
                        modified   to    the   extent   that   the   appellant   shall    be
                        entitled to the salary for the period she has actually
                        worked, pursuant to the interim orders passed by the High
                        Court.   In case, the salary for the said period has not
                        already been paid, the same shall be paid within a period
