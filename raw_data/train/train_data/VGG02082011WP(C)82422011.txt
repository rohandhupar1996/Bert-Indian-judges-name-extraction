         THE HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE SHRI.V.GOPALA GOWDA
                                     AND
                  THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA
                              Date of Judgement: 02.08.2011
B.N. Mahapatra, J.         Challenge has been made to the order dated 28.12.2009
       passed by the Sales Tax Officer, Assessment Unit, Khurda (for short, ‘STO’)
       by which applications of the petitioner for refund of Rs.1,86,56,062/-
       pertaining to 1999-2000 have been rejected under Section 14 of the Orissa
       Sales Tax Act, 1947 (for short, ‘OST Act’).
       2.            Shorn of unnecessary details, the case of the petitioner is
       that it is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 having

                                       2
its Head Office at 7/33, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi and factory
at 1053 (P), Aluminium Park, Industrial Estate, AT: Sarua, Dist: Khurda,
Orissa. The petitioner has set up a Unit at Village ‘Sarua’ Gram
Panchayat, Dist: Khurda for manufacturing Aluminium wire rods and
Aluminium products with a project cost of more than rupees one crore
and had commenced its commercial production from 12 th June, 1998. It
is a priority industry within the meaning of IPR 1996 and Entry 43-A of
the tax exempted list under the OST Act, 1947. The Director of Industries
issued eligibility certificate dated 24.09.1998 for sales tax concession on
raw materials, machinery, spare parts, packing materials and finished
products under IPR, 1996. In paragraph-6 of the eligibility certificate it
was declared that the petitioner-Unit is eligible for the above exemption
subject to a ceiling of 200% of fixed assets, i.e., Rs.198.17 lakhs as
assessed. The said certificate was issued for eight years from the date of
commercial production, i.e., from 12.05.1998 to 11.05.2005. The
Director of Industries, Orissa had amended paragraph-6 of the eligibility
certificate dated 24.09.1998 by order dated 30.11.1999 to the following
effect:-
                    “Item 6- This unit located at Sarua under
              Begunia Sub-Division of Khurda District.
              Khurda is eligible for extension of exemption of
              sales tax on machinery, spare parts, raw
              materials, packing materials and finished
              products by 2 additional years including eight
              years and there will be no maximum limit on
              such exemption during the eligibility period as
              amended vide Notification No.2184/I-XIV-III-
              99/98 dtd.2.2.99 of the State Government in
              Industries Department, Bhubaneswar…”

                                    3
3.           According to the petitioner, it being a priority industry, is
entitled to exemption for maximum period of eight years with the
extension of two years and there shall not be any maximum limit on such
exemption during the eligibility period of eight years. The STO while
passing assessment order for the year 1999-2000 expressed his inability
to   allow  such    exemption  in  absence    of   corresponding    Finance
Department     Notification amending    Entry    43-A.   Against  the  said
assessment order, the petitioner preferred first appeal. The First
Appellate Authority held the petitioner’s Unit to be an SSI Unit and as
per Entry 42-A of the exempted list, it was only entitled to exemption up
to 100% of the capital investment. Accordingly, direction was given to the
STO to recompute the extent of exemption available to the petitioner at
the rate of 100% of the fixed capital investment and not up to 200%.
Being aggrieved by the first appellate order, the petitioner preferred
Second Appeal before the Orissa Sales Tax Tribunal (for short, ‘the
Tribunal’) which also confirmed the finding of the 1 st appellate authority.
Against the order of the Tribunal, petitioner approached this Court by
filing W.P.(C). No.2976 of 2003. This Court vide order dated 21.12.2007
allowed the writ petition holding that the petitioner is entitled to avail
sales tax exemption in accordance with IPR 1996 and quashed the
assessment order, 1st appellate order and 2nd appellate order. The
Department filed special leave to appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court against the judgment of this Court in W.P.(C) No.2976 of 2003

                                     4
which was dismissed on 07.11.2008. Pursuant to the judgment of this
Court passed in the aforesaid writ petition, petitioner submitted two
refund applications before the STO claiming refund of Rs.1,86,56,062/-.
Petitioner’s said two applications for refund were rejected vide impugned
order passed under Annexure-2. Hence, the present writ petition is filed
challenging the action of the opposite parties in rejecting the petitioner’s
refund applciations.
4.           Mr.S.C.Lal, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
petitioner submitted that the STO as advised by the Commissioner of
Sales Tax, Orissa has passed the impugned order under Annexure-2
rejecting petitioner’s application for refund even though the STO held
that the entitlement of the dealer for exemption would be considered in a
fresh manner in an assessment proceeding for which notice is required to
be issued.    The petitioner has not been served with any such notice of
assessment. Once the order of assessment has been quashed by this
Court, retention of the amount becomes illegal, unauthorised and
arbitrary. Due to the arbitrary action of opposite parties, the petitioner
has sustained huge financial loss besides mental torture. In view of the
order passed by this Court in W.P.(C). No.2976 of 2003, the rejection of
refund applications is most arbitrary and illegal. Rejection of the refund
applications on the basis of the observation made in case of NALCO [W.P.
(C). No.13000 of 2003] is most arbitrary. Concluding his argument Mr.
Lal prayed for quashing of the impugned order, Annexure-2 and for a

                                     5
direction to opposite parties to grant refund of Rs.1,86,56,062/- for the
year 1999-2000 with interest from the date of application for refund.
5.           Mr.R.P.Kar, learned Standing Counsel for Commercial Taxes
Department submitted that the capital investment of the petitioner was
to the tune of Rs.198.17 lakhs. As per Entry 43-A, the petitioner was
entitled to sales tax exemption up to 200% of the capital investment
referred to above. Accordingly, the STO has allowed the sales tax
exemption up to Rs.3,96,34,000/- in respect of purchase of raw
materials, sale of finished products made by the petitioner, which is
evident from the orders of assessment passed for the years 1998-99 and
1999-2000. After allowing the exemption as per Entry 43-A sales tax was
charged and demand raised for the year 1999-2000, i.e., with effect from
13.06.1999. According to Mr.Kar, this Court in the case of National
Aluminium Company V. Commissioner, Sales Tax, Orissa & Ors; (2009) 25
VST 404, held that the very fact that the petitioner Unit exceeded the
maximum limit of exemption of sales tax, i.e., 200 per cent of the fixed
capital investment during the year 1998-99, has not been examined by
this Court in Rishabh Electricals (supra). Therefore, the writ petition filed
by NALCO was dismissed by this Court giving opportunity to file first
appeal against the assessment order and the First Appellate Authority
was directed to consider all factual and legal issues raised by
Mr.Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.Kar, learned counsel
for Revenue and Mr.Lal, learned Senior Advocate for opposite party No.5
in the aforesaid case. Mr. Kar vehemently argued that unless this vital

                                        6
issue is decided by the appellate authority no refund can be granted to
the petitioner pursuant to the order of this Court passed in W.P.(C)
No.2976 of 2003 wherein this Court has only held that the petitioner is
entitled to get the exemption under IPR 1996. It is further contended that
this Court in its order dated 21.12.2007 passed in W.P.(C) No.2976 of
2003 has not given any direction or order for grant of any refund to the
petitioner. Therefore, Mr.Kar prayed for dismissal of the present writ
petition.
6.           The only question that falls for consideration is as to whether
in the facts and circumstances of the case, the STO is justified in
rejecting the refund applications of the petitioner vide impugned order
dated 28.12.2009.
7.           At this juncture, it is relevant to extract here the observation,
direction and order of this Court made in NALCO (supra).
             “According to Mr. Kar, learned counsel for the
             Revenue, M/s REPL started its commercial production
             from 12.06.1998 and since the unit exceeded the
             maximum limit of exemption of sales tax, i.e., by 200%
             of the fixed capital investment during the year 1998-
             99, the unit thereafter was not eligible to avail any tax
             exemption. If the contention of Mr. Kar that M/s REPL
             had exceeded the maximum limit of sales tax
             exemption during the year 1998-99 or any period prior
             to 2002-03 is found to be correct, then the question
             does arise as to whether the additional benefit granted
             under the Finance Department Notification dated
             12.11.2002 would be available to M/s REPL (O.P.
             No.5). If that be so, this aspect has to be examined in
             the light of other objections raised by Mr.Kar. The
             counsel for the parties have not disputed that in the
             earlier judgment of this Court in Rishabh Electricals’
             case (supra) these aspects have not been examined.

                                      7
            7.            Thus, the main dispute involved in this case
            is whether prior to year 2002-03, the purchasing dealer
            M/s REPL had exceeded the maximum exemption limit
            thereby disentitling it to avail sales tax concession for
            the year 2002-03 in terms of notification dated
            12.11.2002. Another important aspect of the case is as
            to under what circumstances the eligibility certificate
            had been granted for a period of eight years at initial
            stage in contravention of the statutory provisions. More
            so, in case M/s REPL had availed of the benefit of
            eligibility certificate exhausting the maximum limit
            during a particular period as to whether further benefit
            could have been taken by it making misrepresentation.
            It       is    settled      legal    proposition        that
            misrepresentation/fraud vitiates every action/order
            whether the assessment orders made in favour of M/s
            REPL which might have attained finality could have any
            sanctity. All these questions are admittedly questions of
            fact. Such factually disputed question cannot be
            adjudicated by this Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction.
            8.            In that view of the matter, we are not
            inclined to entertain the writ petition and thus
            accordingly dismissed.
                          However, it is open to the petitioner to
            prefer statutory appeal against the impugned
            assessment order along with a petition for condonation
            of delay. If such an appeal is filed along with a petition
            for condonation of delay within a period of four weeks
            from today, the appellate authority shall consider the
            question of delay taking into consideration that the
            writ petition was pending in this Court since
            10.12.2003. Since opportunity is given to the
            petitioner to file first appeal against the assessment
            order, the first appellate authority shall consider all
            factual and legal issues raised by Mr. Sharma, learned
            counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Kar, learned counsel for
            the Revenue and Mr. Lal, learned senior counsel for
            opposite party No.5 giving opportunities to the parties
            keeping in view the provisions of Section 23(5) of the
            OST Act read with Rule 51 of the OST Rules, 1947.”
8.          The only objection of opposite party-Department for not
granting refund to the petitioner is the pendency of the proceedings
before the appellate authority pursuant to the order of this Court in

                                                8
     NALCO case (supra). Unless various aspects as highlighted in the case of
     NALCO (supra) are examined, claim of the petitioner for refund cannot be
     considered. Therefore, the Sales Tax Officer is justified in rejecting the
     refund applications of the petitioner vide impugned order dated
     28.12.2009. However, in the fact situation, we direct that the said
     proceedings be completed by the appellate authority within a period of
     three months from today, if not already completed. On the basis of such
     adjudication of the appellate authority, the refund, if any, be granted to
     the petitioner along with interest as provided under the statute within a
     period of one month of such adjudication.
     9.                In the result, the writ petition is disposed of with the above
     observations/directions.
                                                              ……………………...

     V. Gopala Gowda, C. J.             I agree.
                                                              …....………………..
