CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KAIT
SURESH KAIT, J. (Oral)
1.     The present appeal has been preferred against the impugned award
dated 12.02.2007, whereby the learned Tribunal has dismissed the claim
petition filed by the appellants.
2.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that
the learned Tribunal has failed to appreciate the basic principle governing
the measure of damages for damage to property in tort as well as in contract
is ‘restitutio in integrum’.
3.     Learned counsel submitted that question before the learned Tribunal
was that as to what would be reasonable and fair compensation under the
MAC.Appeal No. 566/2008                                           Page 1 of 4

circumstances to put the appellants so far as the money can, in the same
position, had the accident not occurred.
4.     Learned counsel submitted that the learned Tribunal has not
appreciated the evidence adduced by the appellants and dismissed the claim
petition.
5.     Brief facts of the case are that on 23.01.1995, an army truck BA
No.84-C-36789-K was met with an accident with maruti car No.DL-6C-
8087. Respondent No.1 Deepak Goswami, who was driving the above noted
maruti car, has stated in the written statement that on 23.01.1995 at around
9.15 pm he was going from Prithviraj Road towards Aurbindo Marg as he
had to go to the Safdarjung Airport Petrol Pump. He further stated that
signal was green at the crossing; at that moment he was at the middle of
Aurbindo Chowk; the army truck of the appellant bearing BA No.84-C-
36789-K TK 10N came at high speed and rammed into the respondent’s
moving car. It is further stated that Lans Naik M. Kutty was driving the
offending truck in a rash and negligent manner and in respect of the
accident; FIR No.13/95 was also registered against the driver of the army
truck.
6.     Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that after the
accident, the army vehicle was not repaired, however, was downgraded from
Class III to Class VI. To prove this fact, the appellants have produced
document Ex.PW2/2, which revealed that value of Class III vehicle has been
assessed at Rs.2,15,018/-, whereas value of Class VI vehicle has been
assessed at Rs.64,512/- and in this respect taking the value of Class VI and
MAC.Appeal No. 566/2008                                         Page 2 of 4

value of Class III vehicle, the approximate damages have been assessed at
Rs.1,50,506/-.
7.     Learned counsel for the appellants has admitted that the police has not
mechanically inspected the offending vehicle in FIR No.13/95. It is also
admitted that the appellants have not spent anything on the repair of the said
vehicle nor any evidence has been led before the learned Tribunal so as to
prove the damages on the accidental vehicle.
8.     It is noted that the letter dated 26.01.1995 written by Major
U.S.Chhib, Officer Commandant to Head Quarter, Delhi Cantt Area
indicates that there were minor damages to both vehicles.
9.     After perusing the letter dated 26.01.1995, material on record and the
evidence, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion that neither the
military truck nor the military person suffered any injury.
10.    It is a matter of fact that the petition was filed before the learned
Tribunal on the basis of the reduction in the value of the vehicle which was
reflected only in the records of the appellant.
11.    It is also an admitted fact that the accident occurred between the
maruti car and an army truck, however, there is no record or proof that while
hitting the said maruti car, the truck had suffered any damage. It is also
difficult to believe that the truck hits the maruti car and the truck being so
sturdy got damage. The claim petition under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
can be filed for a compensation for the injury to a person or a property
involved in the accident.

12.    However, in the present case, the appellants have failed to prove that
the said truck got any damage in the accident. Therefore, I do not find any
merit in the instant appeal.
13.    Accordingly, the appeal is hereby dismissed.
                                                        SURESH KAIT, J.
