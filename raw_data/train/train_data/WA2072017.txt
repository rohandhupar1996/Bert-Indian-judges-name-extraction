                                 BEFORE
          HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
            HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
31.7.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr. D Das, learned senior counsel, assisted by Mr.UJ Saikia,
        learned counsel for the appellants.
        Mr.MK Choudhury, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr.N
        Baruah and Mr. TN Srinivasan, learned counsel for the
        respondent No.1.
        This appeal is directed against the interim order dated
12.7.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court in
WP(C) No.4045/2017 directing the appellants to provisionally declare
the withheld examination result of the students of Respondent No.1
College.
        During the course of hearing, it was suggested by the
respective counsel for the parties that instead of admitting the writ
appeal, the learned Single Judge may be requested to hear and finally
decide the writ petition itself on an early date and till then, operation
of the impugned order dated 12.7.2017 be stayed.
        We, accordingly, with the consent of the learned counsel for
the parties and also having regard to the facts and circumstances of
the case, request the learned Single Judge to hear and finally decide
the writ petition in the week commencing from 21.8.2017 and till
then, operation of the impugned order dated 12.7.2017 shall remain
stayed.
         JUDGE                                     CHIEF JUSTICE
