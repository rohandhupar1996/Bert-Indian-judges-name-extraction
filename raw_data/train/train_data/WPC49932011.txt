                                     JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                    Heard Mr. P.N. Goswami, the learned Government Advocate appearing for
            the petitioners in all the three cases. The respondent Nos.1—9 in the WP(C)

            and they are represented by the learned Counsel Mr. M. Khan. The learned Senior
            Counsel Mr. U.K. Nair appears for D.K. Handique (respondent No.11), who served

            2.1     The challenge in the writ petition is to the judgment dated 7.9.2010 in the
            Case No. O.A. 66/2007 (Page-92) of the Assam Administrative Tribunal whereby,
            direction was issued for disbursing the salary to the teacher and staff of the
            Rabidaspara Harijan M.V. School (hereinafter referred to as the Rabidaspara
            School). The High Court’s judgment in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 is also for
            release of Pay & Allowances for the staff of Rabidaspara School and accordingly,
            the Review petition 112/2012 is filed to challenge the said direction dated
            27.11.2000.
            2.2     The Civil Rule 3072/1993 was filed by 85 petitioners, who were appointed
            on 10.9.1993 but whose appointments came under cloud 2 weeks later, since the
            earlier approval for the appointment conveyed on 07.07.1993 by the Joint Director
            of Elementary Education, was kept in abeyance by the W.T. dated 23.09.1993.
                                                 BACKGROUND
            3.      The first Civil Rule No.3072/1993 was filed by Md. Jilani Ahmed Laskar and
            84 others, who were appointed in various L.P. Schools on 10.09.1993 by the D.I.
            Schools, Cachar district. The appointment letter(s) [Annexure-F series] mentioned
            that appointments are being made on the basis of approval granted on
            07.07.1993 and the names of the schools were also specified in the appointment
            letter(s). The appointees joined the respective school(s) on 10.09.1993 itself (date
            of appointment) by furnishing Joining Report(s) [Annexure-G series] to the school
            Headmaster(s). But within 2 weeks, the Director’s approval order was kept in
            abeyance, by the W.T. dated 23.09.1993. The aggrieved appointees accordingly
            challenged the W.T. and that was stayed by this Court on 14.10.1993. The writ
            petition was allowed on 07.08.1996 with direction to the authorities, to pay the
            pay and allowances to the petitioners. The final order being relevant, is extracted
            hereinbelow, for ready reference :-
                    “The petitioner has been working in the School since 10.9.1993. Thereafter show
                    cause notice was issued to show cause as to why his services were not terminated.
                    As against the said show cause the petitioner approached this court, the Hon’ble
                    Court was pleased to pass an injunction dated 14.9.93 and the petitioner is
                    continuing in the said service even now as Asstt. Teacher. The respondent have not
                    filed any affidavit in the matter. In view of the same status quo will continue and
                    services of the petitioner be regularized in the normal course. The matter is
                    disposed of. There will be nor order as to costs. The respondents are directed to
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                             Page 4 of 13

                    pay the salary and allowances entitled under the law within a period of four
                    months from the date of receipt of this order”
            4.      The 2nd Civil Rule No.2734/1996 was filed by Sisir Kanta Dey and 4 other
            staff of the Rabidaspara school to claim their current and arrear salary. The Court
            observed that the services of the petitioners were regularized on 25.12.1995 and
            accordingly, direction was issued on 27.11.2000 for disbursal of Pay for the school
            staff. The final order being relevant for the purpose of the present judgment, is
            extracted hereinbelow :-
                    “Heard Mr. S. Kakati, learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Govt.
                    Advocate, Assam.
                    The case of the petitioners’ is that they are working in Rabi Das Para Harijan M.V.
                    School and the school was provincialised in 1975 with effect from 1.5.82.
                    However, they are not receiving their salaries since 1.5.82 although their services
                    were regularized from the aforesaid date vide letter dated 25.12.1995. Therefore,
                    the petitioners approached this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
                    in Civil Rule No.2734 of 1996. The respondents however, failed to file any
                    affidavit in opposition in the last 4 years disputing the claim of the petitioner.
                    This writ petition is therefore disposed of with the direction to release the pay and
                    allowances as per orders passed by the competent authority. The release of salary
                    shall be completed within a period of 3 (three) months from the date of the copy of
                    this order is placed before the authorities”
            5.      The decision in the above tow cases was rendered, in absence of any
            counter affidavit from the respondents side and therefore the Court erroneously
            noted that the five litigants in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 was regularized.
            Around seven years after the High Court’s verdict, the Government issued
            direction on 05.09.2002 to regularize the services of the dropped teaching and
            non-teaching      staff   of   the   Rabidaspara       School.    Consequently,       individual
            regularization orders were issued on 04.12.2002 for those employees, by D.K.
            Handique, the then DEEO, Cachar. The significant feature of the regularization
            order is the reference to the High Court verdict in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996. As
            can be seen from the extracted judgment that the High Court, never issued
            direction for regularization but the staff of the Rabidaspara School, were
            nevertheless regularized, by misutilizing the Court’s verdict.
                                           FIRST CASE IN TRIBUNAL
            6.      The direction issued by the High Court on 07.08.1996 for release of salary
            to the 85 litigants in the CR No.3072/1993 and also for the 5 litigants in the CR
            No.2734/1996 did not however result in salary payment for the claimants from
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                                 Page 5 of 13

            Cachar district. Thereafter the first case before the Tribunal i.e. the Case No.31
            ATA/2007 was filed by around 1271 aggrieved teachers of Cachar district to claim
            salary. Suspecting the bonafide of the large number of claimants, the Tribunal
            opined that it is not possible to ascertain whether the appellants were ever
            appointed, if so where and also whether, they are still serving. Thus, instead of
            admitting the case, the Tribunal directed the litigants to furnish a detail statement,
            containing all relevant particulars. The initial order passed by the Tribunal on
            21.07.2007 being relevant, is extracted herein below:-
                    “The learned Advocate for the appellant and the learned senior Govt. Advocate as
                    well as the learned Junior Govt. Advocate are present and heard on the question of
                    admissibility. In the instant case the number of appellant being 1271, it is not
                    readily possible to ascertain as to whether there is a prime facie case from the
                    voluminous document. It is not readily possible to ascertain if the appellant were
                    all appointed, where they appointed, where they are serving at present and when
                    they were regularized, etc.
                    Therefore instead of admitting the appeal the right now the appellants are directed
                    to furnish a detail statement containing the above mentioned particulars in respect
                    of all the appellants and to submit the authority, authorizing appellant namely Sri
                    Nurul Hauzue Laskar to swear and also be file the affidavit as well as the appeal
                    on behalf of all the appellant. Fix 12.9.07 for preliminary hearing.”
            7.      However the litigants never furnished their particulars and instead opted to
            withdraw their Case (No.31 ATA/2007) and accordingly, the same was allowed to
            be withdrawn on 19.09.2007, by the Tribunal.
                                         SECOND CASE IN TRIBUNAL
            8.1     The litigants from Rabidaspara School then segregated themselves from
            the larger group and re-approached the Tribunal to claim salary. In the Case
            No.67 ATA/2007, the Commissioner of the Education (Elementary) Department
            resisted the claim with the following averments:-
                    “…………………
                    6.       That the deponent states that all appellants of Appeal No.31 ATA/07
                    including the present appellants’ cases were already examined by the deponent to
                    consider their grievances but not a single appellant was found working in the
                    school when visited. The appellants also failed to produce their appointment orders
                    in this regard. Moreover, there was no record in the D.I. of Schools, Silchar
                    regarding selection of the appellants and no such sanctioning orders or adjustment
                    orders of the Government in the office of the deponent.
                    7.       That the deponent states that all appointment of teachers are fake and
                    fraudulent. The Appeal No.31 ATA/07 was filed to draw huge amount of public
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                             Page 6 of 13

                    money in fraudulent manner. A big racket was working in coordinated manner to
                    give effect to this game of fraudulent drawal of public money. And matter was
                    handed over to CID.
                    ………………………….”
            8.2     A separate affidavit by the Director of Elementary Education was filed in
            the Case No.67 ATA/2007 to oppose the litigants’ prayer for salary:-
                    “…………………………….
                    5.       That, in this regards, the former Director of Elementary Education, Assam,
                    (Sri. B.K. Das) had personally visited to enquire into the matter of appointment of
                    1262 Primary Schools Teachers and 9 nos. of Middle School Teachers and the
                    findings were submitted to the Govt. vide his letter No.EHA.272/2005/184, dated
                    24.04.2006 (Copy enclosed as Annexure-i)
                             In view of the above, the claim of arrear salary by the appellants cannot be
                    considered.
                    6.       That, at the time of visiting the schools, the DEE, Assam found not a
                    single teacher was working in the school as claimed and the Headmasters of those
                    schools pleaded ignorance of any teachers whom the Investigating Officer
                    searched for. Moreover, the DI of Schools, Silchar also apprised that, no records
                    were available in the office of the Deputy Inspector of Schools, Silchar related
                    with these group of L.P. and Middle School teachers. Therefore, question of
                    seizure of any documents including appointment letter from them does not arise at
                    all.
                    ………………………………”
            9.1     The learned Tribunal in the impugned decision recorded that the appellants
            were not appointed through a regular process in the Rabidaspara School, but
            erroneously construed that the service of the appellants were regularised in
            pursuant to the direction of the High Court. Thus the litigants from the
            Rabidaspara School were held entitled for their regular and arrear salary and on
            that basis, direction was issued on 07.09.2010 to the authorities, to disburse the
            dues.
            9.2     Since it was projected by the departmental authorities that the concerned
            staff were not found to be present in the school during the inspection made by the
            senior officers, the Tribunal left it open for the authorities, to draw up
            Departmental Proceeding for the errant staff, of the Rabidaspara School.
                                              STATE’S CHALLENGE
            10      Aggrieved by the above direction issued by the Administrative Tribunal and
            noticing that verdict of the High Court was made the justification for the direction,
            the State not only challenge the Tribunal’s decision but have also applied for
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                               Page 7 of 13

            review of the two verdicts in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 relating to the claimants
            from Rabidaspara School and the Civil Rule No.3072/1993, relating to the 85
            claimants, from Cachar district.
            11.1    Assailing the direction issued by the High Court and the Tribunal, for
            disbursal of salary to the respondents, the State’s counsel submits that the
            claimants were never appointed through a bonafide process envisaged by law and
            therefore the Government could not have been fastened with the liability, to bear
            the burden of salary, for the undeserving claimants. Referring to the method of
            recruitment    prescribed  by Rule 3 of the Assam Elementary Education
            (Provincialisation) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the “Recruitment
            Rules”), the Govt. lawyer submits that the claimants were never selected as
            envisaged by the recruitment norms and therefore the State’s counsel Mr. P.N.
            Goswami contends that, salary cannot be paid for those, who do not even claim to
            have been appointed, through a legitimate process.
            11.2    Mr. Goswami argues that when the appointment of the respondents/writ
            petitioners was not in accordance with the Recruitment Rules, the illegal status of
            the claimants does not get rectified with passage of time or through undeserving
            appointment order(s), issued for extraneous consideration and on that basis it is
            submitted that, the Court should correct the erroneous direction for payment of
            salary to the undeserving litigants, by reviewing its earlier verdict.
            11.3    To demonstrate the collusion of the departmental officers in facilitating the
            undeserving benefits, Mr. Goswami submits that the then D.I. of Schools had
            purportedly issued appointment letters on 10.09.1993 for the 85 litigants in the
            Civil Rule No.3072/1993 but as can be seen from the joining report(s) of the
            appointees, most curiously, each of them managed to join in their respective
            schools spread across the nooks and corners of Cachar district, on the very same
            day i.e. 10.09.1993, when the individual appointment order(s) were issued. The
            counsel submits that those appointment(s) were illegally made, without selection
            or even vacancies but only for extraneous consideration. Therefore the W.T. dated
            23.09.1993 was issued within 2 weeks of appointment (10.09.1993), to keep in
            abeyance the approval order for appointment, conveyed earlier on 07.07.1993, by
            the Joint Director.
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                       Page 8 of 13

            11.4    To justify the plea for review, Mr. P.N. Goswami, the learned counsel
            submits that the High Court is a Court of record as envisaged in Article 215 of the
            Constitution and is thus possessed of plenary power, to correct erroneous order.
            The counsel therefore argues that in a case of the present nature, the High Court
            not only has the power but also a duty, to correct the glaring error in conferring
            benefits for undeserving litigants. According to Mr. Goswami, the present case has
            extraordinary ramification and therefore the Court should not be bound by the
            limits of the review power conferred under the CPC but should exercise its plenary
            power to correct the erroneous verdict.
            11.5    The State’s lawyer refers to the enquiry report(s) dated 21.01.2006,
            24.04.2006 and the last one on 17.07.2012 of the Addl. D.C., to project that the
            concerned claimants were never appointed through a legitimate process and in
            fact, they were not found during the inspection of the schools and accordingly it is
            submitted that the judgment of the Tribunal as also of the High Court, should be
            revisited to correct the erroneous direction, for the undeserving litigants.
                                       RESPONDENTS’ ARGUMENTS
            12      On the other hand, Mr. M. Khan, the learned counsel representing the
            claimants from the Rabidaspara School submits that when the High Court issued
            direction as far back as on 27.11.2000 in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 to disburse
            the salary for the staff of the Rabidaspara School, a Review Petition to undo the
            long standing verdict should not be entertained by the High Court. According to
            the counsel, the invocation of review power would not be justified, even on a plea
            of public interest.
            13.1    Representing the respondents in the Review Petition No.126/2012, who
            secured relief from the High Court in the Civil Rule No.3072/1993, Mr. K.R. Patgiri,
            the learned counsel refers to the regularisation order passed by the D.I. of
            Schools, Silchar for the 157 L.P. teachers in Cachar district to argue that when the
            teachers were regularised in vacancies shown in the D.I.’s orders, the resistance
            to their salary claim by the State, is wholly unjustified and accordingly Mr. Patgiri
            argues for dismissal of the Review Petition.
            13.2    Respondents submit that the approval to the appointment of 91 teachers
            was conveyed by the Joint Director on 07.07.1993 and thereafter the individual
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                         Page 9 of 13

            appointment order(s) were issued on 10.09.1993 and the appointees had
            immediately joined in their respective schools. Hence the logic of the approval
            order being kept in abeyance within 2 weeks is questioned and accordingly it is
            argued by Mr. Patgiri that the direction for disbursal of salary for the 85 litigants in
            the Civil Rule No.3072/1993 is a fair order, which should be left undisturbed,
            without entertaining this Review Petition.
                                               DISCUSSION
            14       The sheet anchor of the argument of the petitioners is that the
            respondents had not been appointed through any legitimate process and
            therefore, neither the High Court nor the Administrative Tribunal, should have
            burdened the State exchequer, with salary obligation for this undeserving group.
            15       On the other hand, the respondents contend that entertainment of the
            Review Petition after so many years of the High Court verdicts, would not be
            justified under any circumstances since, rightly or wrongly, appointment/
            regularisation orders were issued, for the teachers by the authorities.
            16       The large group who were appointed on 10.09.1993 by the D.I. of Cachar
            district, never entered service through a due process envisaged under the
            Recruitment Rules. Their claim to appointment does not flow from any select list
            prepared under Rule 3 and the only basis for their claim is the illegitimate
            appointment order(s) issued on 10.09.1993. In the context of salary claim of
            teachers, who were not appointed under the Recruitment Rules, the Supreme
            Court in Nazira Begum Lashkar Vs. State of Assam reported in (2001)1 SCC 143,
            had declared that such illegal appointees cannot claim equitable benefits and
            accordingly the dismissal of the claim by the High Court for those, who entered
            service illegally, was approved by the Supreme Court. This decision shows the
            erroneous direction issued by the legal forums.
            17       The Court cannot also be oblivious of the fact that a large number of so
            called appointment orders were issued by the local officer at Silchar on 10.09.1993
            and although the appointments were made in distant schools, all the appointees
            could miraculously submit their joining reports in their respective schools spread
            across the entire Cachar district, on the same day i.e. 10.09.1993. This itself
            indicates the connivance since it would be impossible for the large group of
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                        Page 10 of 13

            appointees to receive an appointment orders on a particular day and to join at the
            appointed schools at a distant places, on the same day.
            18       That apart, the enquiry reports of the Director of Elementary Education
            dated 21.01.2006, 24.04.2006 and of the Addl. D.C., Cachar, dated 17.07.2012
            clearly reflect that the claimants were not found present in the schools during the
            surprise inspection. The illegalities committed by the departmental officials to
            confer legitimacy on the claimants was also revealed in the reports. To ignore
            such glaring discrepancies would mean that the illegalities will be allowed to be
            perpetrated. Therefore corrective measures need to be taken since in the
            perception of the Court, the cause of justice would otherwise be undermined.
            19       In the absence of counter pleading, the High Court erroneously construed
            the claimants in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 to be regularised but if they were of
            the regularised category, as claimed in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996, there should
            have been no occasion six years later on 05.09.2002, to again regularise the same
            litigants from the Rabidaspara School. This shows misrepresentation and also the
            pro-active role of some officers, to help the undeserving cause of the litigants.
            20       In situations where the Court verdict is already acted upon by the other
            side, the High Court may not entertain a belated Review Petition. But in the
            present case, the salary to the litigants have not been disbursed notwithstanding
            the Court verdicts in the Civil Rules No.2734/1996 and in the Civil Rule
            No.3072/1993 and therefore, the ratio in State of Nagaland Vs. Toulvi Kibami
            reported in (2003)8 SCC 671 relied upon by the respondents, will have no
            application in the facts of the present case.
            21       As a Court of record, the power of review can be invoked by the High
            Court in exercise of its plenary power to correct illegal directions. When the verdict
            of the Court is wrong and the cause of justice is defeated by allowing claims of
            undeserving litigants, the Court will have to rise to the occasion to order course
            correction as otherwise, an unjust cause will draw support from the Court’s
            erroneous orders. Therefore the invocation of review power in the present case, is
            found to be justified, on the strength of the ratio in M.M. Thomas Vs. State of
            Kerala reported in (2000)1 SCC 666 and in Asstt. Commissioner, Income Tax Vs.
            Saurashtra Kutch Stock Exchange Limited reported in (2008)14 SCC 171.
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                       Page 11 of 13

            22       In the perception of the Court, an extraordinary situation has arisen in the
            present case, where the State is made responsible to pay salary to a group of
            litigants, who were never appointed/regularised through any legitimate process. In
            fact, in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 or in the Civil Rule No.3072/1993, the High
            Court     had    no    occasion    to    examine    whether     the    litigants    were
            appointed/regularized, through any legal means process. But only because the
            counter affidavits were not filed, the direction for disbursal of salary was issued by
            the High Court.
            23       On the other hand, the State strongly pleaded before the Administrative
            Tribunal that the claimants were undeserving of any relief by way of direction for
            payment of salary but only because of the earlier direction given by the High Court
            for disbursal of salary, the Tribunal disregarded the pleaded case of the State and
            directed disbursal of salary even for the teachers, who were not found in the
            school.
            24       What is discernible from the materials on record is that while the State
            failed to file any counter affidavit in the two cases before the High Court, the
            innocuous Court direction in the Civil Rule No.2734/1996 and the Civil Rule
            No.3072/1993 were made the basis, for perpetuating the illegalities, by way of
            appointment/regularization, of the undeserving litigants. When the High Court had
            not issued any such direction, drawing support therefrom to issue appointment/
            regularization orders, would not be warranted. If undeserving benefits are allowed
            and the State’s exchequer is burdened with huge sum on salary account, on the
            strength of the Court’s verdict, it would amount to misuse of the judicial forums.
            25       The above discussion indicate an extraordinary situation where the Court
            process is being misutilised for cornering undue benefit. The failure of the State to
            file counter affidavits in the two Civil Rules had persuaded the Court to give relief.
            But what is more disturbing is that the departmental authorities went on to
            regularize/appoint the undeserving litigants, by misconstruing the Court’s verdict.
            Moreover, connivance of officials are also seen to confer a colour of legitimacy, on
            the claimants who never entered service through due process and perhaps, never
            rendered any duties in the schools.
            26       In such circumstances the Court is of the considered opinion that the State
            has made out a case for review of the judgments dated 27.11.2000 and
WP(C) 4993/2011                                                                          Page 12 of 13

            07.08.1996 passed in Civil Rule Nos.2734/1996 and 3072/1993, respectively. The
            impugned direction given by the Tribunal on 07.09.2010, is also not sustainable
            for the same reasons. Accordingly the Review Petitions as well as the writ petition
            stand allowed and the concerned judgments are recalled. It is ordered
            accordingly. No cost.
                                                                                JUDGE
