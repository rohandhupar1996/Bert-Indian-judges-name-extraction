        Heard Mr. N Nath, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner as
well as Ms. M Bhattacharjee, the learned Additional Senior Government
Advocate who appears for all the respondents. Since the two writ petitions
involve common questions and filed by the same petitioner, they are taken
up together for disposal.
2.      The case of the writ petitioner in brief is that he was appointed as
Sub-Inspector of Police (Wireless Technician) (S.I. (WT) for short) vide
appointment letter dated 5.12.2001 (Annexure-1) subject to police
verification report and production of medical fitness certificate. Besides
other terms and conditions, the appointment letter provided that the
petitioner will have to undergo the Police Basic Drill and Discipline Training
of 39 weeks’ duration. Thereafter on successful completion, he would be
required to undergo and complete the Grade-III and Grade-II Police
Wireless Technician Trade Course of 9 months and 6 months duration
respectively in order to qualify as S.I. (WT) Grade-II.

3.      In terms of the letter of appointment, the petitioner joined the post
and completed 21 months training. Barring the Grade-III and Grade-II
Police Wireless Technician Trade Course, the petitioner has completed his
training for the other courses indicated in the appointment letter.
According to the petitioner, he was initially posted at Darrang district and
subsequently transferred to Karimganj district and he has rendered his
service for the last 13 years. The petitioner having not completed his
training course in the Grade-III and Grade-II was asked to complete the
remaining training course but since the petitioner considered himself not
to be physically fit for such training, the petitioner through his wife
submitted a representation before the Governor of Assam seeking
relaxation under Rule-23 of the Assam Police Manual and to consider
change of his trade from Wireless Technician to Operating trade. The
Governor of Assam vide communication dated 2.11.2012, directed the
respondent No. 4 (Director General of Police, Communication) to examine
and consider the application of the petitioner for trade conversion.
4.     The petitioner again on 10.4.2014 (Annexure-8) submitted a
representation for relaxation as per Rules and for trade conversion. The
said representation was received by the respondent authorities on
2.5.2014. However, to the surprise of the petitioner, a departmental
proceeding was drawn up against him under Section 65 of the Assam
Police Act, 2007 read with Rule 66 of the Assam Police Manual Part-III,
Article 311 of the Constitution of India and Rule 7 of the Assam Services
(Discipline and Appeals) Rules, 1964 for his indiscipline and unbecoming
conduct rendering him unfit for retention in the police force. The
departmental proceeding was drawn up vide D.O. No. 437 dated
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                       Page 4 of 16

29.4.2014 (Annexure-9) with a copy marked to the writ petition. The
petitioner being aggrieved, filed WP(C) No. 2893 of 2014 which however,
due to the developments in the case was withdrawn by him with liberty to
file afresh through order dated 6.2.2015 (Annexure-18).
5.      The petitioner thereafter, filed WP(C) No. 923 of 2015 challenging
the    drawal      of    departmental   proceeding   against   him    and    the
communication dated 15.07.2014 by which by which his application for
trade conversion was rejected. Subsequently, he also filed WP(C) No.
3561 of 2015 for setting aside the second show cause notice dated
30.04.2016 as well as order of termination from service dated 30.05.2016.
6.      The first show cause notice dated 15.05.2014 (Annexure-10), the
petitioner was asked to show cause as to why he should not be punished
for his gross unbecoming conduct on the charges provided therein
requiring him to submit his written statements of defense within 10 days
from the date of receipt of the communication. The charges are
reproduced below for ready reference:
                 “That, as per your appointment terms and conditions you are to
        undergo, successfully complete and pass the Grade-III and Grade-II

        submitting petitions dtd. 25.11.2010 and 29.12.2010 thereby you have
        exhibited insubordination and disobeyed the lawful order of the office.
                 That, within the years 2006 to 2011 you were called for the said
        training course for more than 5(five) times but you did not turn up on

        by I(T) Karimganj and subsequently submitted petition for sick leave
        thereby you have exhibited disobedience to the lawful order of the
        superior and insubordination”.
7.      In response to the show cause notice, the petitioner submitted his
reply on 10.7.2014 (Annexure-11) clarifying the allegations made out
against him and requesting that the charges be discarded and cancelled.
Thereafter vide communication dated 15.7.2014 (Annexure-12), the
petitioner was informed by the respondent No.4 that his application for
trade conversion from Technician Grade to the Operating Grade was
rejected since he was yet to qualify for the post of S.I. (WT) Grade-II.
8.      The petitioner despite being summoned on various occasions to
participate in the departmental proceedings failed to do so except send his
reply by speed post on 10.06.2015 along with copies of annexures as
evidences to be considered in his defence. Consequently, the enquiry
officer on 10.7.2015 (Annexure-19) submitted the enquiry report with a
conclusion that the charges against the petitioner were proved.
9.      The Superintendent of Police (Communication) HQ-II thereafter on
30.4.2016 (Annexure-20) issued a second show cause notice to the
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                         Page 7 of 16

petitioner wherein it was stated that the disciplinary authority agreed with
the findings of the enquiry officer and that the charges were proved
beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, it was provisionally decided to award
him the penalty of dismissal from service. He was therefore asked to show
cause and submit his representation against the proposed action within a
period of 10 days from the date of receipt of the said communication. The
second show cause notice was received by the petitioner on 13.5.2016.
On 22.05.2016, the petitioner wrote to the respondent No.7 requesting for
15 days time w.e.f. 22.5.2016 to submit his reply. However, time was not
given and the petitioner was dismissed from service vide order dated
30.05.2016 (Annexure-24).
10.     The admitted position is that the departmental proceedings was
held and concluded ex-parte and therefore, Mr. N Nath the learned
counsel for the writ petitioner submits that he will not go into the nitty
gritty of the facts and will confine his argument only on four basic points
or grounds to show that the writ petition is with merit and warrants
Court’s interference.
11.     The first ground raised by Mr. N Nath is with regard to the findings
of the enquiry officer that the petitioner was unauthorisedly absent w.e.f.
13.4.2014 to 12.5.2014 without any permission from the competent
authority. He submits that as no charge for such unauthorized absence
was drawn up by the disciplinary authority in the first show cause notice
dated 15.5.2014, the finding of unauthorized absence is only misconceived
and unsustainable.
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                      Page 8 of 16

12.     Secondly, he submits that respondent authorities could not have
initiated the departmental proceeding when his application for relaxation
as per Rules and change of trade/grade conversion from Wireless
Technician to the Operating trade was pending consideration. In fact, vide
communication dated 2.11.2012, the Governor of Assam informed the
respondent No. 4 to dispose of the representation of the petitioner and
again the petitioner on 10.4.2014 himself submitted his representation.
Therefore, the respondent authorities could not have initiated disciplinary
proceeding against the writ petitioner on 29.4.2014 or 15.5.2014. The
respondent authorities having rejected the petitoner’s representation only
on 15.7.2014 clearly demonstrates that the disciplinary proceeding were
drawn against the petitioner prior to disposal of his representation.
13.     The third ground raised by Mr. N Nath is that the findings recorded
by the enquiry officer is wholly perverse and not sustainable in law in as
much as there is no mention about the written statement of defence taken
by the writ petitioner in his written reply to the first show cause notice.
Although the petitioner may not have participated in the enquiry
proceeding but nevertheless, the enquiry officer was required to consider
the petitioner’s clarification before arriving at a conclusion through the
enquiry report. He therefore submits that biasness is writ large on the
findings of the enquiry officer.
14.     The fourth and last ground according to Mr. N Nath is that there is
clear violation of Sub Rule (9) of Rule 9 of the Assam Services (Discipline
and Appeals) Rules, 1964 since the disciplinary authority is required to
record its finding by considering the written statements of the defence
amongst others. He submits that in the instant case, a copy of the enquiry
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                      Page 9 of 16

report was not given to the writ petitioner prior to the issuance of the
second show cause notice and therefore, the petitioner was deprived of a
reasonable opportunity to be heard by the disciplinary authority before he
made up his mind to terminate him from service. In this regard, Mr. N
Nath relies relies upon the decision of this Court rendered in case of
Motiur Rahman vs. United Commercial Bank & Ors. reported in 2003 (1)
GLT 196 which further relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in the
case of M.D. ECIL Hyderabad & Ors. vs. B Karunakar & Ors. reported in
1993 (4) SCC 727. He submits that the Apex Court in Karunakar (supra)
held that the right to a reasonable opportunity will be deemed to be
denied if a copy of the enquiry report is not made available to a
delinquent officer at a stage where the disciplinary authority is yet to
make up its mind as regard the culpability of the charges against the
employee or otherwise. Therefore, as a copy of the enquiry report was
furnished to the petitioner only by way of the second show cause notice
dated 13.4.2016 after the disciplinary authority accepted the enquiry
report and proposed to award the penalty of dismissal from service to the
petitioner, the       petitioner was clearly not afforded a reasonable
opportunity.
15.     Mr. N Nath further relies upon the decision rendered by the Division
Bench of the Orissa High Court in the case of Bibhuti Bhusan Das vs.
Divisional Superintendent S.E. Rly. reported in AIR 1964 Orissa 279 to
contend that reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the
proposed action as contemplated in Article 311 (2) of the Constitution is
mainly a question of fact depending on the circumstances to each case
and is also justiciable to a limited extent if his subsequent removal is
challenged on the ground that this clause has been contravened.
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                     Page 10 of 16

Therefore, under such circumstance, he submits that the impugned order
of dismissal of the petitioner from service cannot be sustained.
16.     Appearing for the State respondents, Ms. M Bhattacharjee, the
learned Additional Senior Government Advocate submits that the
appointment of the petitioner as S.I. (WT) is governed with certain terms
and conditions including completion of Grade-III and Grade-II training in
Police Wireless Technician Grade course for 9 months and 6 months
duration     respectively. The    petitioner  despite being given several
opportunities willfully and deliberately failed to undergo the said training.
Therefore after following due process, the petitioner was found unfit to be
retained in the police force and he was therefore rightly dismissed from
service. She submits that the representation submitted by the petitioner
through his wife was duly forwarded to the respondent No. 4 by the
Governor of the State and in compliance thereof, the petitioner was given
a personal hearing on 25.3.2013 where he gave a written undertaking that
he was prepared to undertake the training after the month of July and
August, 2013. As such his representation was duly considered by the
respondent authorities. Ms. M Bhattacharjee further submits that the
second representation of the petitioner dated 10.4.2014 was received by
the department only on 2.5.2014 and by which time it was already
decided to hold an enquiry against him. The decision to hold a
departmental enquiry against him was taken on 29.4.2014 and soon after,
the first show cause notice was issued to him on 15.5.2014. As for his
second representation, it was considered and disposed on 15.7.2014. She
submits that under such circumstance, the departmental proceeding was
initiated much before the petitioner’s representation was received by the
respondent authorities and therefore, no wrong was committed. The
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                     Page 11 of 16

charges having been proved against the petitioner after having an
enquiry, he cannot have any legitimate grievance against the respondents.
She submits that the petitioner himself is aware of the fact that such
training is clearly stipulated in his appointment letter but the petitioner
willfully refused to undergo the same. Therefore, under the facts and
circumstances, the writ petition being without any merit should be
dismissed.
17.     I have considered the rival submissions of the parties and perused
the material available on record including the departmental records
produced by the learned Additional Senior Government Advocate.
18.     Since, the learned counsel Mr. N Nath has restricted his argument
to the four grounds mentioned above, the same may be examined. The
learned counsel submits that the enquiry officer by his enquiry report
dated 10.7.2015 came to the conclusion that the petitioner remained
unauthorizedly absent w.e.f. 13.4.2014 to 12.5.2014 without permission
from the competent authority although such finding was besides the
charge leveled against the petitioner. The admitted position is that the
first show cause notice dated 15.5.2014 was taken as memorandum of
charge against the writ petitioner. Third paragraph of the first show cause
notice states that the petitioner availed 7 days casual leave w.e.f.
22.9.2013 and thereafter extended his leave upto 28.3.2014. Upon joining
on 29.3.2014, he was directed to move for the training course vide S/No.
RR/92/2010-14/ Part-/44 dated 4.4.2014 and RR/92/2010-14/ Part/ 47
dated 11.4.2014 but he kept himself out of reach of the I (T) Karimganj so
as to avoid receiving his release order issued by I (T) Karimganj and
subsequently       submitted petition  for sick  leave  thereby     exhibited
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                     Page 12 of 16

disobedience to the lawful order of his superior and resulted in
insubordination. It is against such charge that the enquiry officer found
the petitioner to be unauthorisedly absent w.e.f 13.4.2014 to 12.5.2014.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the findings of the enquiry officer is
misplaced. It may also be seen that although the petitioner tried to send a
sick report when he was released to undergo the training on 13.4.2014,
the petitioner was not accorded sick leave but he however, remained
unauthorizedly absent from 13.4.2014 to 12.5.2014 as can be seen from
the records as well as from the findings of the enquiry officer.
19.     The second contention of the learned counsel for the writ petitioner
is that the respondent authorities could not have initiated departmental
proceedings when his application for change on trade conversion from
technical trade to the operating trade was pending consideration may be
considered. Wife of the petitioner submitted a representation on his behalf
before the Governor of Assam for change his grade/trade from technical
trade to the operating trade. The application was forwarded to the
respondent No. 4 by the Governor’s office on 2.11.2012 for consideration.
Accordingly, a personal hearing was given to the petitioner on 25.3.2013,
whereupon the petitioner agreed in writing to undertake the next batch of
the training. Assuming that the request for changing his trade was not
considered, but the fact remains that he himself agreed to go for the
training in the next batch in writing and therefore, it can only be inferred
that he has accepted the rejection of his representation towards change of
his trade/grade. The representation of the petitioner submitted by him on
10.4.2014 was also disposed of by the respondent authorities on
15.7.2014 by rejecting the same. Although the representation dated
10.4.2014 was received by the authority concerned on 2.5.2014 while the
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                      Page 13 of 16

departmental enquiry was initiated on 29.4.2014, it cannot be considered
to be an impediment in drawing such enquiry pending disposal of his
representation. The contention of the learned counsel for the writ
petitioner that had the representation of the petitioner been considered
favorably, there would be no occasion to send him for the training cannot
be accepted as it is only a hypothetical proposition. The initial
appointment of the petitioner clearly stipulated the required training to be
completed by the petitioner in order to be confirmed as S.I. (WT) and
therefore the petitioner without completing the mandatory training cannot
claim the change of his trade as a matter of right.
20.     The third ground raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner
that the findings of the enquiry officer is wholly perverse since the stand
of the petitioner through his written reply was not considered by the
enquiry officer may also be looked into . It may be noted that the entire
departmental proceedings mainly revolves around the failure on the part
of the petitioner to undertake the training in question despite being given
several opportunities. His unauthorized absence without his sick leave
being accepted and granted also relates to a period when he was released
to undergo the said training. Further, the petitioner despite being
intimated also failed to participate in the enquiry process for one reason or
the other which only demonstrates that he was least interested to present
his case besides avoiding the training. In such circumstances, the findings
of the enquiry officer cannot be said to be perverse.
21.     Coming to the last ground taken by the learned counsel for the writ
petitioner that the respondent authorities have violated Sub-Rule (9) of
the Rule 9 of the Assam Services (Disciplines and Appeals) Rules, 1964
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                       Page 14 of 16

may be examined. Sub-Rule (9) of the Rule 9 provides that the disciplinary
authority shall if it is not the enquiring authority consider the record of the
enquiry and record its finding of each charge. The order of termination
annexed by the writ petitioner in his writ petition as Annexure-24 is only a
WT message sent to him since the petitioner was not available in the
station. A perusal of the relevant record reveals that the disciplinary
authority recorded his findings in detail in order to arrive at the conclusion
that the petitioner should be dismissed from service. As such, the question
of violation of Sub-Rule (9) of Rule 9 of the Assam Services (Disciplines
and Appeals) Rules, 1964 cannot be accepted.
22.     It can be further seen that although the petitioner was given 10
days time to submit his reply to the second show cause notice dated
30.4.2016 which was admittedly received by him on 13.5.2016, petitioner
again vide his letter dated 22.5.2016 requested for extension of 15 days
time to submit his reply. The disciplinary authority however upon receipt
of the application of the petitioner on 24.5.2016 decided to impose the
order of dismissal upon the petitioner vide order dated 30.5.2016. The
petitioner on his part after having received the second show cause notice
on 13.5.2016 for reasons best known to him only decided to apply for the
extension of time vide his communication dated 22.5.2016 ie; only a day
before the 10 days time given to him expired. This action demonstrates
the attitude of the petitioner which can only be observed as unwarranted
coming from a person belonging to a disciplined force.
23.     There is no argument upon the proposition of law laid down in the
decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the writ petitioner ie;
Matiur Rahman (supra) as well as Bhibuti Bhusan Das (supra). However,
W.P( C) No.3561of 2016
W.P.( C) No. 923 of 2015                                        Page 15 of 16

the same will have to be understood and applied only if it can be
established that prejudice was caused to the petitioner for not being
supplied the enquiry report prior to the stage of the second show cause
notice.
24.      The Apex Court in the case of Haryana Financial Corporation & Anr.
Vs. Kailash Chandra Ahuja reported in (2008) 9 SCC 31 has held that even
in those cases where procedural requirements have not been complied
with, such action ipso facto cannot be held to be illegal, unlawful or void
unless it is shown that non-observance had prejudicially affected the
person concerned. Applying the ratio to the instant case and on the given
facts and circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that the case of
Matiur Rahman (supra) as well as Bhibuti Bhusan Das (supra) cannot
come to the petitioner’s rescue. Therefore, under the facts and
circumstances of the case and upon perusal of the entire materials
available, I do not find merit in the writ petitions warranting the
interference of this Court.
25.      Having opined thus, both the writ petitions fail and are dismissed.
Parties to bear their own costs.
