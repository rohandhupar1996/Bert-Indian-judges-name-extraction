BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.      The counter affidavit handed over by Mr Siddharth Panda on behalf of
respondent no. 2 is taken on record. The learned counsel for the petitioners
does not wish to file any rejoinder affidavit and reiterates the contents of the
writ petition in response to the said counter affidavit.
2.      By way of this writ petition the petitioners seek the benefit of Section
24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
WP(C) 8565/2015                                                                Page 1 of 3

Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred
to as ‘the 2013 Act’) which came into effect on 01.01.2014. The petitioners,
consequently, seek a declaration that the acquisition proceeding initiated
under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the 1894
Act’) and in respect of which Award No.15/1987-88 dated 05.06.1987 was
made, inter alia, in respect of the petitioners’ land comprised in khasra nos.
1012 min (3-0), 1013 min (0-4), 1025 min (0-5), 1028 min (4-7) and 1029
min (2-5) measuring 10 bigha 2 biswas in all in village Chattarpur, Delhi,
shall be deemed to have lapsed.
3.      In this petition khasra no. 1027 min (4-17) was also claimed but,
according to the learned counsel for the Land Acquisition Collector, that
khasra was not acquired under the said award.
4.      It is an admitted position that neither physical possession of the
subject lands has been taken by the land acquiring agency, nor has any
compensation been paid to the petitioners. The award was made more than
five years prior to the commencement of the 2013 Act. All the ingredients of
section 24(2) of the 2013 Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court and this
Court in the following decisions stand satisfied:-

          (iv) Surender Singh v. Union of India and Ors.: W.P.(C)
                 2294/2014 decided 12.09.2014 by this Court.
5.      As a result the petitioners are entitled to a declaration that the said
acquisition proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act in respect of the subject
lands are deemed to have lapsed. It is so declared.
6.      The writ petition is allowed to the aforesaid extent. There shall be no
order as to costs.
