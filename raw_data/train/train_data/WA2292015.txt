                                                          WA No.229 of 2015
                                   BEFORE
            HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
11.7.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr. HR Khan, Mr. R Hussain and Ms. L Das, learned counsel for the
        appellants.
        Mr. RKD Choudhury, learned Additional Senior Government
        Advocate, Assam assisted by Mr. R Dhar, learned counsel for the
        respondents.
        Heard on admission.
        This intra-court appeal is directed against the order dated 3.6.2015
passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court, whereby he has
dismissed appellants’ WP(C)No.3214 of 2015.
        On 09.06.2005, an advertisement was issued by the Director of
Social Welfare, Assam, to fill up 662 numbers of Grade-III and Grade-IV
backlog vacancies in different departments of the Government of Assam
by physically disabled candidates. This step was taken to honour and
achieve the object of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities,
Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The appellants along
with many others also applied for the posts advertised. Interview was held
on 06.07.2005, whereafter a State Level Select List was published on
28.09.2006. The names of appellants did not find place in the Select List.
They also did not challenge the selection process for nine years.
        However, two writ petitions were filed wherein the petitioners
contended that they were selected at the district level but because of
manipulation at the time of preparation of the State Level Select List, their
names were omitted. In these writ petitions, the State Government
admitted anomalies and irregularities in the preparation of the Select List
at the State Level. Therefore, both the writ petitions were allowed vide
order dated 23.04.2015 directing appointment of petitioners therein
against the available vacancies after due verification.
                                                                  page 1 of 2

         It is only after passing of the order dated 23.04.2015, the
appellants filed WP(C) 3214/2015 on 30.5.2015 seeking appointment
against the vacancies covered by advertisement dated 9.6.2005. The
appellants could not explain any reason for the abnormal delay of 10 years
in approaching the Court. In the writ petition also, no explanation was
given by the appellants for delay of 10 years in filing the petition. The
learned Single Judge therefore dismissed the writ petition.
         After hearing the learned counsel for the appellants, we also find
ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned
Single Judge. The maxim vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt
which means ‘the law assists those who are vigilant and not those who
sleep over their rights’ is very much applicable in the present case. The
appellants slept over their legal rights, if any, for more than 10 years. No
relief, therefore, can be granted to them.
         We find no merit in the appeal. It is accordingly dismissed
summarily.
