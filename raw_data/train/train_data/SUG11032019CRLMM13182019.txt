       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR
                           ORDER
                            (ORAL)
       Quashing of FIR No. 63/2019, under Sections 182/406 of IPC
registered at police station Kirti Nagar, New Delhi is sought on the basis
of Affidavit of 7th March, 2019 of respondent No.2/complainant and on
the ground that the misunderstanding which led to registration of the FIR,
now stands cleared between the parties.
        Mr. Izhar Ahmed, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for
respondent-State accepts notice and Mr. Kunal Nath, Advocate, accepts
notice on behalf of respondent No.2.
       Learned Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent–State submits
Crl.M.C. 1318/2019                                                    Page 1 of 3

that respondent No.2, present in the Court, is complainant/first-informant
of the FIR in question and he has been identified to be so, by his counsel
as well as by SI Pankaj on the basis of identity proof produced by him.
       Respondent No.2, present in the Court, submits that the dispute
between the parties has been amicably resolved and in terms thereof
amount of ₹34,00,000/-, lying deposited in police station Kirti Nagar,
New Delhi, is to be released to him. Respondent No.2 affirms the
contents of his Affidavit of 7th March, 2019 supporting this petition and
submits that now, no dispute with petitioner survives and subject to
release of aforesaid amount, the proceedings arising out of the FIR in
question be brought to an end.
       Petitioner’s counsel submits that there is no objection to release of
₹34,00,000/- lying deposited in police station Kirti Nagar, New Delhi to
respondent No.2/complainant.
       Supreme Court in Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai
Vs. State of Gujarat (2017) 9 SCC 641 has reiterated the parameters for
exercising inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of
FIR / criminal complaint, which are as under:-
       “16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be
    criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant
    element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing insofar
    as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned.
    16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from
    commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar
    transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate
    situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute.
    16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal
    proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants,
Crl.M.C. 1318/2019                                                 Page 2 of 3

    the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a
    criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice;”
       Upon hearing and on perusal of the FIR of this Case, I find that
continuance of proceedings arising out of the FIR in question would be an
exercise in futility as the misunderstanding, which led to registration of
the FIR, now stands cleared between the parties.
       Accordingly, this petition is allowed subject to costs of `30,000/-
to be deposited by petitioner with Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund
within two weeks from today. Upon placing on record the proof of
deposit of costs within a week thereafter and handing over its copy to the
Investigating Officer, FIR No. 63/2019, under Sections 182/406 of IPC
registered at police station Kirti Nagar, New Delhi and the proceedings
emanating therefrom shall stand quashed. SHO, Kirti Nagar, New Delhi
is directed to forthwith release ₹34,00,000/- recovered from petitioner to
respondent No. 2.
       This petition is accordingly disposed of.
       Dasti.
