For the appellant                           : Mrs. RB Bora (GA)
For respondents                             :  Mr. A Dutta
                                            :  Mr. H Hoque

Date of hearing and Judgment & Order        : 27-07-2017
                             JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
                  Heard Mrs. RB Bora, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. A
       Dutta, learned counsel for the respondent in MACApp No.13/2011. Also heard
       Mr.SK Goswami, learned counsel for the respondent in MACApp No.12/2011.
        2.        In both these appeals, the common question raises is whether the
        vehicle No.AS-01E 8671 was under requisition by the State at the time of the
        accident.
        3.        The accident took place on 23-11-2004 at Telipara Kumargram
        involving vehicle No.AS-01E 8671 (Tata Sumo) and vehicle No.WGT-1545.
        Some police personal travelling in the vehicle No.AS-01E 8671, while chasing
        another vehicle suspecting transportation of incriminating articles, collided with
        the truck bearing No.WGT-1545, as a result of which, 6 (six) police persons
        including the victims of these appeals died. The legal heirs of victims filed
        MAC Case No.59/2005 and MAC Case No.61/2005 respectively.
        4.       The learned tribunal awarded Rs.7,90,000/- (seven lakhs ninety
        thousand) in MAC Case No.59/2005 and Rs.5,81,200/- (five lakhs eighty one
        thousand two hundred) in MAC Case No.61/2005.             The learned Tribunal
        observed that the vehicle No. AS-01E 8671 was under requisition of the state
        and fixed the responsibility equally on both the vehicles. Since the tribunal
        held the vehicle No.AS-01E 8671 to be under requisition, the state was

                                                                              4
directed to pay 50% of the award in both the cases. The insurer of the vehicle
No.WGT-1545 settled the matter with the claimants to the extent of their
liability in MAC Case No.61/2005 and paid the compensation. In MAC Case
No.59/2005 also the insurer of the vehicle No.WGT-1545 had paid its share as
per apportionment made by the tribunal.
5.         Now the State Government has filed the instant appeals assailing the
award on the ground that the vehicle No.AS-01E-8671 was not requisitioned at
the relevant time and therefore, the tribunal ought not to have fixed the
responsibility on the appellant for satisfying 50% of the awarded amount.
6.        Learned Govt. Advocate Ms. Rita Boro Bora appearing for the appellant
in both the appeals contended that there was no evidence to show that the
vehicle was requisitioned by the Government and therefore, responsibility to
satisfy the award could not be saddled with the Government. On the other
hand, Mr. Goswami and Mr. KK Bhatta appearing for the Insurance Company
submits supporting the impugned award, that on the facts and circumstances
of the case tribunal rightly presumed that the vehicle No.AS-01E 8671 was
under requisition of the government.
7.        Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicle act defines the owner in the
following manner
                       (30) “owner” means a person in whose name a
                motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is
                a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a
                motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase,
                agreement*, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of
                hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle
                under that agreement;
8.        A plain reading of the above provision makes it abundantly clear that
the expression owner of motor vehicle may not necessarily mean a registered
owner in all cases. When the vehicle is in actual possession of any person
other than the registered owner by virtue of any agreement for lease or
otherwise and the owner ceases to have control over the vehicle by virtue of
such agreement of transfer, the person who remained in actual possession and
control of the vehicle is considered to be the owner of the vehicle. It is also
settled position of law, that when any vehicle is requisitioned by the

                                                                                 5
Government or the State under the relevant law, the owner ceases to have no
control over the vehicle because of requisition and in such situation also, the
requisitioning authority or the State shall be deemed to be the owner of the
vehicle. Therefore, for any risk of accident during such period when the actual
registered owner of the vehicle ceased to have control over the vehicle by
virtue of requisition by the government, the liability of the owner is shifted to
the requisitioning authority.      Since the owner is absolved from the liability
during the period of requisition, the Insurance company necessarily cannot be
saddled with the responsibility to indemnify the insured.
9.         In the instant case, there is no dispute, that the registered owner of
the vehicle No. AS-01E 8671 was Gautam Kr. Talukdar and it was also insured
with the respondent Oriental Insurance Company Ltd at the relevant time.
Since there is no dispute that Gautam Kr. Talukdar was the registered owner
of the vehicle No. AS-01E 8671 and Oriental Insurance Co was the insurer,
ordinarily the insurer is liable to indemnify the insured.
10.         The case of the appellant is that the vehicle was never requisitioned
by the State and therefore, no responsibility could be saddled with the State.
The contention of the respondent Oriental Insurance company is that the
vehicle was under requisition and therefore, the Insurance Company has no
liability. The evidence on record shows that except casual statement that the
vehicle was used by police personal at the relevant time, there is no other
evidence on record to show, that the vehicle was requisitioned by the State at
the relevant time. The learned Tribunal is found to have presumed on the
basis of such casual statement that as the vehicle was used by police at the
relevant time it was requisitioned by the government.         Requisition is made
under the particular act and there is certain procedure for requisition of a
vehicle.    When the owner and insurer sought to avoid the liability on the
ground that the vehicle was requisitioned by the government or the state,
some evidence has to be brought on record to show that it was indeed
requisitioned. When admittedly the registered owner of the vehicle was one
Gautam Kr. Talukdar and it was insured with Oriental Insurance Company,
normally the insurer shall be liable. If the owner/insurer seeks to avoid their
liability on the plea of requisition, burden lies with them to prove the factum of
requisition.    Evidently neither the owner nor the insurer had adduced any

                                                                              6
evidence to show that the vehicle was under requisition. In absence of such
evidence in the facts and circumstances of the case, Insurance Company
cannot avoid the liability.
11.        In that view of the matter, I have no hesitation to hold that the
Insurance Company cannot avoid the liability in the present case as the vehicle
was admittedly insured at the relevant time and therefore, the appeal deserves
to be allowed.
12.        The respondent Oriental Insurance Company shall satisfy 50% of
the award with interest as fixed by the tribunal within 2 (two) months by
depositing the same with the Tribunal. The amount if any paid already shall
be adjusted.
14.       Both the appeals are accordingly allowed and disposed of.
15.       Send back the LCR.
