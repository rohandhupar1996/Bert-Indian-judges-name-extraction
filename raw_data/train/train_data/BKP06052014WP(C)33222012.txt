B.K. PATEL, J.          In this writ petition, prayer has been made to quash the
       order under Annexure-5 passed by the opposite party no.3-District Sub-
       Registrar,Cuttack refusing to register sale-deed under Annexure-4, and
       to direct the opposite party no.3 to admit the sale-deed under
       Annexure-4 for registration.

                                   2
2.        Upon    death of original writ petitioner late Santosh Kumar
Routray,    his    legal  heirs  have   been substituted   as  the  writ
petitioners.
3.         Facts in brief, for the purpose of adjudication of this writ
petition, are as follows:
           Case land, corresponding to a part of Sabik Plot No.495 of
mouza Gandarpur, was the undivided joint family property belonging to
the joint family headed by late Gajendra Prasad Routray, father of late
Santosh Kumar Routray and Sangram Keshari Routray. During the life
time of late Gajendra Routray late Santosh Kumar Routray filed
partition suit bearing Title Suit No.37 of 1982 in the Court of learned
Sub-Judge, Cuttack impleading his father late Gajendra Routray,
mother late Susama Devi and brother Sangram Keshari Routray as
defendants. By judgment and preliminary decree dated 28.1.1987 at
Annexure-3 Title Suit No.37 of 1982 was decreed in part holding late
Santosh Kumar Routray to be entitled to 1/4th share in the joint family
property including case land under Sabik Plot No.495.            In the
meanwhile, Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1976 ( for short,
‘the Act’) had come into force.   No notice was served on late Santosh
Kumar Routray by the competent authority for filing statement/return
as provided under Section 6 of the Act.        However, on the basis of
returns filed by Sangram Keshari Routray and late Sushama Devi,

                                     3
U.L.C.Case No.142 of 1976 and U.L.C.Case No.143 of 1976 respectively
were registered.     Orders passed by the competent authority under
the Act in U.L.C.Case No.142 of 1976 and U.L.C.Case No.143 of 1976
were challenged by Sangram Keshari Routray and Sushama Devi in
U.L.C. Appeal Nos.110 and 111 of 1984 which were dismissed by
common     order    dated   18.4.1987.     Thereafter,   notification dated
23.3.1994 containing declaration under section 10(3) of the Act, copy of
which is Annexure-A/2 to the counter-affidavit was issued by the
competent authority.     The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal
Act,1999 came into force with effect from 22.3.1999 and was adopted
by the State Government with effect from 5.4.2002.Late Santosh Kumar
Routray filed W.P.(C) No.10011 of 2004 before this Court with a prayer
to quash the orders passed by the competent authority in U.L.C.Case
No.142 of 1976 and U.L.C.Case No.143 of 1976, common order passed
by the appellate authority in U.L.C. Appeal Case Nos.110 and 111 of
1984 as well as the notification under Annexure-A/2.            Order dated
21.5.2005 passed by this Court disposing of W.P.(C) No.10011 of 2004
reads as follows:
            “The entire case is covered by our judgment dated 5 th of
         September, 2007 passed in W.P.(C) No.998 of 2006
         (Manmohan Lal –v- State of Orissa and others) reported in
         2007(II) OLR 713 in which this Court has held as follows:
                   “4. Abatement of legal proceedings-All proceedings
               relating to any order made or purported to be made
               under the principal Act pending immediately before

                                       4
                 the commencement of this Act, before any Court,
                 tribunal or other authority shall bate:
                     Provided that this section shall not apply to
                 the proceedings relating to Sections 11,12,13 and 14
                 of the principal Act in so far as such proceedings are
                 relatable to the land, possession of which has been
                 taken over by the State Government or any person
                 duly authorized by the State Government in this
                 behalf or by the competent authority.
                     The aforesaid Act ( i.e. Urban Land (Ceiling and
                 Regulation) Repeal Act,1999 was adopted by the
                 State Government as mentioned above, with effect
                 from 5.4.2002. In the said resolution by the State
                 Government adopting the aforesaid Act of 1999, it
                 was declared that no compensation should be paid
                 for land, possession of which has not been taken over
                 by the State Government after vesting under Section
                 10(3) of the U.L.C. Act and the legal processes
                 initiated under the said Act will also be closed.”
                 Therefore, this writ petition is also disposed of in terms
          of the said order and it is directed that as the urban land
          ceiling stands abated and the land in question stands vested
          in the petitioner, the opposite parties are directed to act
          accordingly.
                     Xxx                 xxx                  xxx.”
4.        In the backdrop of the above narrated facts late Santosh
Kumar Routray through his Power of Attorney Holder the substituted
writ petitioner No.1(a)      Prasanna Kumar Routray executed sale-deed
under Annexure-4 and presented it for registration before opposite
party no.3-District Sub-Registrar,Cuttack upon which opposite party
no.3-District Sub-Registrar,Cuttack, in purported exercise of the
jurisdiction under section 22(A) of the Registration Act,1908 passed the
impugned order at Annexure-5 which reads as follows:

                                       5
          “    DISTRICT REGISTRATION OFFICE, CUTTACK

                                        District Sub-Registrar,Cuttack”
5.        Petitioners’ case is that the original       writ petitioner was all
through in possession of the land proportionate to his share exclusively
subject to final allotment to be made in the final decree proceeding. The
order passed by this Court in W.P.(C) No.10011 of 2004 has become
conclusive and binding having reached its finality between the parties.
A copy of the order passed by this Court was placed before the opposite
party no.3-District Sub-Registrar,Cuttack in order to convince that the
case land has already vested with the petitioner. It is averred that any
order/letter communicated by any authority to the District Sub-
Registrar intimating that the case land being ceiling surplus land has
vested in the State lacks legal authority or competency to supersede
and transgress the order passed by this Court. However, opposite party

                                    6
no.3 illegally passed the order in purported exercise of power under
section 22(A) of the Registration Act,1908, adverting           to      the
notification under Annexure-A/2 containing declaration under section
10(3) of the Act to the effect that land including the case land shall be
deemed to have been acquired by and to have vested absolutely in the
State Government.
6.             Counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of opposite party
no. 1 being authorized by opposite party no.2 also. In resisting the
petitioner’s claim it has been averred in the counter affidavit that orders
dated 28.12.1983 were passed by competent authority under the Act
declaring the surplus land, including the case land held by late Susama
Devi and Sangram Keshari Routray on the basis of returns filed by
them in U.L.C. Case Nos. 142 of 1976 and 143 of 1976 which orders
were confirmed by common order passed by Member Board of Revenue
in U.L.C. Appeal Nos. 110 and 111 of 1984. The petitioner preferred
W.P.(C)No. 10011 of 2004 after lapse of 17 years which was disposed of
by order dated 21.5.2009 with a direction that urban land ceiling
stands abated and the case land stands vested in the petitioner. The
only stand on the basis of which opposite parties appear to defend order
under Annexure-5 passed by the District Sub-Registrar, occurring at
paragraph-9 of the counter affidavit, reads as follows:

                                       7
          “It is pertinent to mention here that instead of the land in
          question stands vested in the Government wrongly it has been
          mentioned that the land in question stands vested in the
          petitioner. After the said fact came to the notice   of   the
          present depondent steps has been taken for modifiction of the
          order dated 21.5.2009 passed by this Hon’ble Court in W.P.(C)
          No. 10011 of 2004.”
               According to the opposite parties, after declaration of
surplus land held by the returnee, in accordance with orders passed in
U.L.C. Case Nos. 142 of 1976 and 143 of 1976, and U.L.C. Appeal Nos.
110 and 111 of 1984, notification dated 23.3.1994 under Section 10 (3)
of the Act at Annexure-A/2 to the counter-affidavit was issued upon
which the case land vested absolutely in the State. Possession of the
case land was taken over by the Tahasildar,Sadar, Cuttack and
reported to the competent officer by letter dated 8.3.1993 at Annexure-
B/2. A land schedule containing description of lands, including the case
land, possession of which were taken over was communicated by the
competent authority under the Act to opposite party no. 3-District Sub-
Registrar, Cuttack under Memo No. 1088 dated 31.5.2002 at Annexure-
C/2. In such circumstances, opposite party no. 3 has rightly refused to
register sale-deed at Annexure-4 in exercise of power under Section 22-
A of the Registration Act.
7.             Sri S.S. Das, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
petitioners contended that opposite parties have failed to show that
there was any notification with regard to the case land in terms of

                                    8
Section    22-A  of  the  Registration  Act   indicating   prohibition   of
registration of sale-deed under Annexure-4 to be opposed to public
policy. It was vehemently contended that refusal on the part of opposite
party no. 3-District Sub-Registrar, Cuttack to effect registration of sale-
deed at     Annexure-4, on the face of the unambiguous direction made
by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 to the effect that case land
vested in the petitioner is contemptuous and contrary to settled
principles of judicial discipline. Opposite party no. 3 having acted
contrary to order passed by this Court, direction in the nature of writ of
mandamus is required to be issued for effecting registration of sale-
deed. It was also contented that order in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 was
passed on contest upon consideration of pleadings made in the writ
petition as well as counter-affidavits filed by   opposite party nos. 1-
Commissioner-Cum-Secretary,       Housing     &    Urban     Development
Department and opposite party no. 2-Special Officer & Competent
Authority under the Act, and placing reliance on an earlier decision of
this Court. In passing order in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004, this Court
has upheld the claim of the petitioner to be in physical possession of
the case land. The opposite parties being aware of the legal position
have taken an untenable plea that this Court wrongly mentioned that
the case land stands vested in the petitioner instead of mentioning that
it vested in the Government, and have vaguely averred that step has

                                    9
been taken for modification of the order passed in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of
2004 without indicating with regard to nature of steps stated to
have been taken. It was argued that so long as order passed in W.P.(C)
No. 10011 of 2004 has not been stayed, modified, altered or rescinded,
registration of sale-deed at     Annexure-4 cannot be refused on the
pretext that wrongly in the order passed by this Court it has been
mentioned that the case land vested in the petitioner.
           Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in The Direct Recruit Class-II
Enginerring     Officers   Association   and   others   vs.    State   of
Maharashtra and others:AIR 1990 Supreme Court 1607 to urge that
order passed by High Court in a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution will operate as bar against subsequent petition even in the
Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution in view of the
principle of res judicata. It was argued that so long as earlier order of
this Court in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 remains in force, it is not
permissible to urge that there is any error in the order. Sri S.S.Das,
learned Senior Advocate also brought to the notice of this Court
decision in Manmohan Lal vs. State of Orissa and others: 2007 (II)
OLR-713, on which reliance was placed by this Court in passing order
in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004, to urge that the order passed by this
Court in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 is based on the finding that in spite

                                     10
of notification at Annexure-A/2 purported to have been issued under
Section    10   (3) of  the    Act,   letter  of Tahasildar,       Sadar,
Cuttack at Annexure-B/2 regarding taking over possession and Memo
No. 1088 dated 31.5.2002 at Annexure-C/2 of the competent authority
under the Act to opposite party no. 3-District Sub-Registrar, Cuttack
containing list of surplus lands including case land, the original writ
petitioner was all along in possession over the case land. Sri S.S. Das
learned Senior Advocate also placed reliance on decision in Union of
India and others vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd.: AIR 1992
Supreme Court 711 wherein it has been laid down that principles of
judicial discipline require that the orders of the higher authorities
should be followed unreservedly by the subordinate authorities. Placing
reliance on ratio of the decision in Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. vs.
Income-tax Officer, Bhopal: AIR 1961 Supreme Court 182 it was
argued that refusal on the part of opposite party no. 3 to register the
sale-deed amounts to refusal to carry out the order of this Court in
W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004, and therefore, a writ is required to be issued
to opposite party no. 3 for effecting registration of sale-deed.
8.             In reply, learned counsel for the State appearing for
opposite parties submitted that notification at Annexure-A/2 and letters
at Annexures B/2 and C/2 clearly go to show that possession over the
case land was taken over by the State consequent upon orders passed

                                     11
in U.L.C. Case Nos. 142 of 1976 and 143 of 1976.                 In such
circumstances, the provision of abatement under        the   Urban   Land
(Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 shall not apply in view of
proviso to Section 4 of the said Act.     In W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004,
therefore, it has been erroneously observed that the case land stands
vested in the petitioner. It was submitted that the opposite parties have
taken steps to get the order reviewed and modified. However, no
particular of such review or modification petition was brought to the
notice of the Court in course of hearing. It was also not disputed that
order passed by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 has not been
stayed, modified, altered or rescinded so far.
9.             The only question that arises for determination in the case
is as to whether opposite party no. 3-District Sub-Registrar, Cuttack
was justified in refusing registration of sale-deed at Annexure-4 on the
ground that case land had been acquired and vested in the State under
Section 10 (3) of the Act communicated to the office of the District Sub-
Registrar by Memo at Annexure-C/2 on the face of order passed by this
Court in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004. The opposite parties have made an
attempt to adopt the stand that as possession of the case land had been
taken over by the State as communicated by the Tahasildar by letter at
Annexure-B/2 consequent upon notification dated 23.3.1994 by the
competent authority at Annexure-A/2, provision for abatement under

                                       12
the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 is not
applicable to the case land. However, it appears               from   the  writ
petition in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 that original writ petitioner late
Santosh Kumar Routray had categorically made his claim to be in
possession over the case land all through. It was pleaded at
paragraphs-14 and 17 of the writ petition as follows:
           “14. That, the petitioner has been all through in possession of
         the aforesaid plots proportionate to his share exclusively
         subject to the final allotment to be made in the final decree
         proceeding. Surrender of any land purported to be in excess of
         the ceiling limit under section 9 of the Act by the competent
         authority under the said Act can not affect the right, title and
         interest of the petitioner ignoring the decree passed by the
         Civil Court in Annexure-2.”
         “17. That, the opposite parties 1 and 2 claim to have taken
         possession of the surrendered plots by a Notification
         dt.23.3.1994 published in the Extra-ordinary Orissa Gazette
         dt.29.3.1994, but the petitioner still continues to be in
         possession as before. The writ petitioner further submits that
         if possession is found to have been taken by opposite parties 1
         and 2, the same is symbolical possession as distinguished
         from actual physical possession.”
           In their counter affidavits, opposite party nos. 1 and 2
controverted petitioner’s claim to be in possession and averred that
possession of the case land had been taken over by the Tahasildar as
communicated by letter at Annexure-B/2. Order dated 21.5.2009 was
passed in W.P.(C) No. 10011 of 2004 by the Division Bench on contest
holding that proceedings under Urban Land Ceiling Act in respect of
case land stands abated and the case land stands vested in the
petitioner.   Thereby, the claim of the original writ petitioner to be in

                                     13
possession of the case land has been judicially upheld. In such
circumstances, at present, there is no scope for the opposite parties to
urge that possession of the case land had been taken over on behalf of
the State. On the contrary, in unequivocal and unambiguous term, this
Court having declared the case land to have vested in the petitioners’
predecessor-in-interest, the original writ petitioner, the order passed by
opposite party no.3-Sub-Registrar, Cuttack refusing registration of the
case is unsustainable being contemptuous and contrary to the order of
this Court.
           In view of the above, the writ petition is allowed. Order passed
by opposite party no. 3-Sub-Registrar, Cuttack under Annexure-5 is
quashed. Opposite party no.3-Sub-Registrar, Cuttack is directed to
effect registration of sale-deed under Annexure-4 forthwith not later
than two weeks from today.
                                                ….…………………
