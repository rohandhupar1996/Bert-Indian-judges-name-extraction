        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANMOHAN
                           JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J:
1.      Petitioner by way of present writ petition challenges the forfeiture of
the bid security of Rs. 25 lakhs by the respondent authority on account of the
failure by the petitioner to enter into a Concession Agreement within the
stipulated time in spite of being declared L1 bidder and Letter of Acceptance
being issued in his favour vide letter dated 15th March, 2011.
2.      Mr. Gaurav Mitra, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that it
was inequitable and illegal for the respondent authority to forfeit the bid
security since the Concession Agreement to be entered into for five years
was in contravention of the Outdoor Advertisement Policy dated 10 th
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                           Page 1 of 11

September, 2007 of the government itself. He contended that the Outdoor
Advertisement Policy dated 10th September, 2007 stipulated that the
Concession Agreement in relation to Bus Shelter (category 3) could only be
for a maximum period of three years. He submitted that as the tender
document was in direct contravention of the Outdoor Advertisement Policy
dated 10th September, 2007, it was illegal for the respondent authority to
insist on entering into a Concession Agreement.
3.      Mr. Mitra emphasized that the respondent authority did not deal with
the issue of contravention of the Outdoor Advertisement Policy dated 10 th
September, 2007 while passing the impugned communication dated 31st
October, 2012. He further submitted that the respondent authority did not
give any reasons for rejecting the petitioner's aforesaid argument. Thus,
according to him, there was total non-application of mind by the respondent
authority while passing the impugned order.
4.      Mr. Mitra also submitted that in the present case though the bid
security had been classified as a genuine pre-estimate of compensation and
damages, yet it was in the nature of a penalty. He stated that the respondent
authority on petitioner's failure to enter into a Concession Agreement had
awarded the contract for three out of the five zones to L2 bidder and
annulled the remaining two zones without going for a re-tender. Thus,
according to him, no damage/loss was suffered by the respondent in the
present case.
5.      Mr. Mitra submitted that it is a well established principle of law that
when an amount stipulated in a contract was in a nature of a penalty and not
a genuine pre-estimate of damages, loss had to be proved. In support of his
submission, he relied upon Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                          Page 2 of 11

which reads as under:-
        "74. Compensation of breach of contract where penalty
        stipulated for - When a contract has been broken, if a sum is
        named in the contract as the amount be paid in case of such
        breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way
        of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled,
        whether or not actual damage or loss or proved to have been
        caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the
        contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so
        named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for."
6.       Mr. Mitra also relied upon the judgments of Delhi High Court in
Madhucon Projects Ltd. Vs. National Highways Authority of India and
Ors., MANU/DE/0852/2011, IVRCL Infrastructures and Projects Ltd. Vs.
National Highways Authority of India, MANU/DE/0854/2011, and
Gayatri-DLF Consortium and Ors. Vs. National Highways Authority of
India and Anr., MANU/DE/0853/2011.
7.      Per contra, Mr. Satyakam, learned additional standing counsel for
respondents submitted that present petition was barred by principles of res-
judicata and estoppel. He contended that the show cause notice dated 10 th
February, 2012 was limited to restraining the petitioner from participating in
any bidding process in any project of government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi, popularly known as blacklisting and did not seek to
reopen the issue of forfeiture, which had attained finality.
8.      Mr. Satyakam stated that though the petition refers to the earlier writ
petition being W.P.(C) 2767/2011 and the order passed therein, yet
petitioner in the present writ petition has portrayed as if the issue of
forfeiture had to be decided afresh by the respondent authority.
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                            Page 3 of 11

9.      In rejoinder, Mr. Gaurav Mitra, learned counsel for petitioner stated
that there was no question of res-judicata or abuse of process of court as the
petitioner had withdrawn the earlier writ petition being W.P.(C) 2767/2011
challenging the forfeiture on the assumption that the respondents would
withdraw the order of forfeiture. According to him, since respondents did
not withdraw the forfeiture order, the petitioner had filed its submissions in
its reply to the Show Cause Notice as well as oral arguments. Thereafter,
the respondent had passed the impugned order dated 31 st October, 2012
specifically upholding the forfeiture of bid security. Thus, he submitted that
the impugned order dated 31st October, 2012 had given rise to a new cause
of action and the same was in no way defeated by the disposal of the earlier
W.P.(C) 2767/2011.
10.     Keeping in view the aforesaid submissions and contentions advanced
by learned counsel for the parties, it is first essential to marshal out the facts.
11.     From the pleadings and documents on record, it transpires that the
respondent authority had constructed 750 modern Bus Queue Shelters
(hereinafter referred to as "BQS") at different locations in Delhi.              In
February, 2011, the respondent authority invited bids for marketing,
operation and maintenance of these BQS by private entities for a period of
five years. The BQS were divided into five zones and the bidding process
was undertaken simultaneously with each zone being treated as an
individual and distinct project.
12.     Since the petitioner submitted the highest bids, it was declared as the
successful bidder in all the zones and a letter of acceptance was issued to it
on 15th March, 2011.
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                              Page 4 of 11

13.     As a token of acknowledgement, the successful bidder was required to
return a copy of the letter of acceptance duly signed by its authorised
signatory to the respondent authority within three days from the date of
issuance of the letter of acceptance. The same was returned by the petitioner
duly executed on 11th April, 2011.
14.     The petitioner was thereafter required to execute the Concession
Agreement as well as furnish two performance guarantees equivalent to
three months total monthly payment payable to the Transport Department
for the five zones.
15.     Instead of signing the Concession Agreement, the petitioner vide its
letter dated 14th March, 2011 asked the respondent authority to give to the
petitioner 33% rebate on the monthly licence fee as well as to permit it to
furnish one bank guarantee for single quarter and to grant at least two
months time for conducting site inspection and mobilizing additional logistic
support for obtaining, maintaining and marketing of BQS.
16.     The respondent authority vide its letter dated 7th April, 2011 declined
to make changes in the Concession Agreement on the ground that the
changes sought were financial in nature and were against the spirit of open,
transparent and competitive bidding process which had already concluded.
The respondent authority also asked the petitioner to sign the Concession
Agreement latest by 13th April, 2011, failing which the respondent authority
would proceed to forfeit the petitioner's bank guarantee and initiate process
for blacklisting.
17.     On 11th April, 2011, the petitioner informed the respondent authority
that the petitioner had received a legal notice dated 12th April, 2011 from an
NGO Shristi stating that the contract awarded to it was in violation of the
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                           Page 5 of 11

Outdoor Advertisement Policy, as the contract period stipulated therein was
five years and not three years.
18.     Respondent authority vide its letter dated 15th April, 2015 informed
the petitioner that the agreement had been drafted in terms of the applicable
law and there was no illegality attached to it. It also pointed out that though
the letter written by the petitioner was dated 11 th April, 2011, the notice
from the NGO annexed to the said letter was dated 12th April, 2011!
19.     Respondent once again requested the petitioner to sign the agreement
latest by 20th April 2011, otherwise the Department would forfeit the bank
guarantee and blacklist the company in terms of the bid document.
20.     Since there was no response form the petitioner, respondent authority
vide its letter dated 25th April, 2011 annulled the letter of acceptance dated
15th March, 2011 for all the zones and forfeited the petitioner's bid security
(EMD) amounting to Rs. 25 lacs. The respondent authority in the said letter
clarified that the forfeiture of Earnest Money Deposit was without prejudice
to any other right that it may take including but not limited to blacklisting
the petitioner company from participating in any prospective bid process.
21.     On 27th April, 2011, the petitioner filed a writ petition being W.P.(C)
2767/2011 challenging the encashment of the bank guarantee dated 2 nd
February, 2011 as well as sought directions to the respondents to delete the
various provisions in the bid document which according to it were in
violation of the Outdoor Advertising Policy dated 10th September, 2007.
The prayers in the said writ petition are reproduced hereinbelow:-
        "a. That this Hon'ble Court may restrain the Respondents 1 to 3
        from taking any further action as contemplated by the
        Respondents No. 1 document dated 17th January, 2011 till the
        time the Respondents clarify the position with regard to the
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                            Page 6 of 11

        apparent violations of the policy dated 10th September, 2007
        and till the Respondents 1 - 3 perform their contractual
        obligation under the tender document.
        b.      To call for records pertaining to the said document dated
           th
        17 January 2011 and to direct the respondents to delete the
        various violative provisions in their contract/the said document
        17th January 2011 and in case the terms of the said document
        dated 17th January 2011 are found to be violative of the policy
        dated 10th September 2007 then in that case the Respondents
        may be called upon to restart the process afresh by releasing
        the tender afresh and giving the petitioners an equal
        opportunity to bid again.
        c.      To stay the operation of the letter dated 25 th April 2011
        of the respondents and to stay encashment of the bank
        guarantee 02.02.2011 and for that purpose to restrain the
        respondent No. 4 from releasing the amount of bank guarantee
        and to restrain respondent No. 1-3 from invoking the same.
        d.      to grant liberty to the Petitioners to avail their further
        remedies as may be available to them and as may be advised
        against the Respondents No. 1 to 3 in case the
        allegation/obligations raised by the said society are found true
        and correct and in case the Respondents are able to carry out
        their illegal threats.
        e.      Restrain the Respondent from taking any course or steps
        against the Petitioners to either in form of encashment of bank
        guarantee dated 02.02.2011 and/or to threaten the Petitioner in
        any manner by way of threatening to blacklist the Petitioner or
        in other manner or in other ways."
                                                       (emphasis supplied)
22.     On 28th April, 2011, the petitioner withdrew the aforesaid writ petition
with an assurance to the Division Bench of this Court that it would perform
the contract. The order dated 28th April, 2011 is reproduced hereinbelow:-
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                             Page 7 of 11

                "After arguing at length, learned counsel for the
        petitioner seeks to withdraw the writ petition and the
        application so as to approach the respondent/authorities
        assuring that the petitioner will perform the contract.
                Dismissed as withdrawn."
                                                     (emphasis supplied)
23.     It is pertinent to mention that on 27th April, 2011 the respondent
authority had issued instruction to petitioner's banker forfeiting the bid
security amount furnished by the petitioner. Vide letter dated 2nd May, 2011
the petitioner's banker sent a banker's cheque of Rs. 25 lacs in favour of the
respondent and the same was realized by the Accounts Branch of the
Transport Department.
24.     On 31st May, 2011, the respondent authority restrained the petitioner
and its directors from participating in any bidding process in any project of
Government of NCT of Delhi.
25.     Thereafter the petitioner filed another writ petition being W.P.(C)
7154/2011 challenging its blacklisting primarily on the ground that the same
was in violation of principles of natural justice as no opportunity of hearing
had been given. In the said writ petition it was averred that after encashing
the bank guarantee for Rs. 25 lacs, the impugned action to blacklist the
petitioner and its directors was arbitrary and illegal. The prayer clause in
W.P.(C) 7154/2011 is reproduced hereinbelow:-
        "a) Issuance of writ of mandamus, certiorari or any other
        appropriate writ for setting aside letter dated 31st May 2011
        issued by the Respondent No. 2 to the Petitioners thereby
        restraining the Petitioner and all its Directors from
        participating in any bidding process in any project of the
        Respondent No. 1 for a period of 3 years.
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                           Page 8 of 11

        b)      further to declare the said impugned letter as illegal and
        for further restraining the respondents from black listing the
        petitioner and its directors in respect of the various tenders
        floated by the Respondent and further restraining the
        Respondents from rejecting any bids of the Petitioner which are
        outside the terms of the bid or on the basis of the impugned
        letter dated 31st May, 2011 and/or on any grounds which are
        arbitrary, illegal and irrational.
        c)      Further restraining the Respondent and passing an
        interim order in favour of the Plaintiff that the bid submitted by
        the Petitioner in respect of the new NIT dated 6 th September,
        2011 for 242 newly constructed Modern Stainless Steel Bus
        Queue Shelters, shall not be rejected/refused on the grounds of
        the impugned letter dated 31st May, 2011 which shall stand
        cancel as there was no Notice prior to such letter by the
        Respondents for restricting the participation of the Petitioner.
        d)      Any other relief as this Hon'ble court may deems fit and
        proper may also be granted."
                                                       (emphasis supplied)
26.     However, in the said writ petition it was admitted by the petitioner
that it had executed a similar contract dated 6th May, 2011 with regard to
other BQS containing similar clauses.
27.     Vide letter dated 10th February, 2012 the blacklisting order was
withdrawn and a show cause notice limited to blacklisting was issued to the
petitioner. The relevant portion of the show cause notice is reproduced
hereinbelow:-
        "Now, the undersigned hereby show cause you as to why not
        M/s. Prabhatam Advertising Private Limited and all of its
        Directors should not be restrained in any bidding process in
        any project of Government of National Capital Territory of
        Delhi for a period of three years. Your reply, if any, should
        reach to undersigned by 23.02.2012 failing which it would be
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                             Page 9 of 11

        presumed that you have nothing to say and appropriate
        decision will be taken without any further opportunity."
                                                      (emphasis supplied)
28.     In view of the subsequent issuance of the show cause notice dated 10th
February, 2012, learned counsel for the petitioner admitted that its writ
petition being W.P.(C) 7154/2011 had become infructuous as its grievance
had stood redressed.
29.     After giving an opportunity of hearing, though the respondent
authority in the impugned order dated 31st October, 2012 asserted that the
reasons given by the petitioner for non-signing the Concession Agreement
were bizarre and frivolous, yet it withdrew the show cause notice limited to
blacklisting on the ground that the bid security amount had already been
forfeited.
30.      From the aforesaid facts it is apparent that the present petition is an
abuse of process of Court as the issue of forfeiture had stood settled and had
attained finality vide order dated 28th April, 2011 passed by the respondent
authority as well as by virtue of dismissal of the writ petition W.P.(C)
2767/2011.
31.     What was impugned in the subsequent writ petition, that is, W.P.(C)
7154/2011 was the order of blacklisting of the petitioner and its directors.
Further, the show cause notice dated 10th February, 2012 was confined to the
issue of blacklisting.
32.     Moreover, as by the impugned order dated 31st October, 2012 the
show cause notice dated 10th February, 2012 was withdrawn, this Court
deprecates the conduct of the petitioner in re-litigating. In fact, the present
writ petition has been filed with malafide intent to rake up a settled issue of
W.P.(C) 7532/2012                                           Page 10 of 11

forfeiture of earnest money deposit. In N.D. Qureshi Vs. Union of India,
2008 (13) DRJ 547, a Division Bench of this Court of which the present Bench
was a party has observed as under:-
         “12. Moreover, from the above narrated facts, it would be
        apparent that the petitioner has been re-litigating for a
        considerable number of years. In our view on the principle of res
        judicata and re-litigation the petitioner is even barred from
        raising new pleas for the same old relief. The Hon’ble Supreme
        Court in K.K.Modi Vs. K.N.Modi and others, reported in (1998) 3
        SCC 573 has held that it is an abuse of the process of the court
        and contrary to justice and public policy for a party to re-litigate
        the same issue which has already been tried and decided earlier
        against him. This re-agitation may or may not be barred as res
        judicata. But if the same issue is sought to be re-agitated, it also
        amounts to an abuse of the process of the court. The Hon’ble
        Supreme Court has further held that if a spurious claim is made in
        a case, it may also amount to an abuse of process of the court. In
        our view, frivolous or vexatious proceedings amount to an abuse
        of the process of the court especially where the proceedings are
        absolutely groundless-like in the present case.”
                                                       (emphasis supplied)
33.     Consequently, present writ petition and pending application are
dismissed with costs of Rs. 50,000/- to be paid to respondent authority
within two weeks. Respondent authority is also directed to take into account
the petitioner's conduct in indulging in frivolous litigation while awarding
future contracts to it.
