             work. As much as the offer made by the appellant was
             lowest,            the   Letter   of  Intent   was   issued   to  the
             appellant.
             8.        As      per   the   tender   conditions,    the  appellant
             herein            has   produced   the   document   issued    by  the
             Executive Engineer, Roads and Buildings Department,
             Mahabubabad             Division,    showing   distance    from   the
             “Batch Type Hot Mix Plant” to that of the site at
             99.05           kilometers.     Disputing    correctness    of   such
             distance, the fourth respondent/ writ petitioner has
             on         18.05.2018,        filed    a   complaint    before    the
             concerned authority i.e. the Chief Engineer. On such
             complaint,             the    Chief    Engineer,    called    for   a
             verification               report     from    the     Superintending
             Engineer, R & B Circle, Warangal. As per the report

             Engineer, the actual distance between the Hot Mix
             Plant and the last point of working reach was shown
             at       101.50        kilometers.    In   the   same   report,   the
             Superintending               Engineer,     Warangal,      has    also

             alternate route, the actual distance from the Hot

             Mix Plant to the last point of working reach comes
             to 99.90 kilometers.
             9.        In      view of   the dispute    raised by    the fourth
             respondent again, about the correctness of distances
             mentioned             in   the    report     submitted     by   the
             Superintending             Engineer,      Warangal,    the    Chief
             Engineer vide his letter dated 11.06.2018, requested
             the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, to verify
             the distance between the location from the point of
             Hot Mix Plant, owned by the appellant, to that of
             the        last     point  of   working   reach  of  the   site  in
             question.
             10. Vide report dated 04.07.2018, the Superintending
             Engineer,            Karimnagar   informed   the  Chief    Engineer
             that the distance between the Hot Mix Plant, owned
             by the appellant and the last point of working reach
             is 98.1 kilometers.
             11. In the report dated 04.07.2018, filed by the
             Superintending            Engineer,    Karimnagar,  addressed    to
             the Chief Engineer, as the distance between Hot Mix
             Plant owned by the appellant and the last point of

             in favour of the appellant. The fourth respondent
             has        questioned       the  same    by   way   of   Writ  Petition
             filed           under   Article    226    of    the   Constitution    of
             India.
             12. The learned Single Judge of the High Court has
             held          that   in   absence   of    any   specific    mala   fides
             against             any     individual,        the     re-verification
             undertaken,             about    the   distance,       by   the    Chief
             Engineer, is not illegal. Learned Single Judge has
             observed that when the tender conditions permit the
             tenderer to make objection, which obviously, require
             consideration, by necessary implication, permit the
             tendering authority to re-verify and re-consider the
             material submitted before him. It is observed that
             when the fourth respondent has raised an objection
             against           the   certificate     issued     in  favour   of   the
             appellant,            no    fault   can     be    attributed    to   the
             authorities in getting the re-verification done and
             obtaining a report from an independent authority.
             Having            found    that   there      is    no   illegality    or
             arbitrariness            on   the  part    of    the  authorities,    in
             decision-making               process,      learned     Single     Judge

             dismissed             the   Writ   Petition     vide   order    dated
             25.02.2019.
             13. When            the said    order is    questioned by     way of
             intra court appeal under clause 15 of the Letters
             Patent, the Division Bench of the High Court has
             found fault with the report of the Superintending
             Engineer, Warangal, to the extent in giving distance
             particulars from the alternate route. Further, it is
             observed that when the report of the Superintending
             Engineer,            Warangal,   was    not  accepted,    the   Chief
             Engineer should not have sought a second report from
             the        Superintending       Engineer,    Karimnagar.      In  the
             order it is stated that the jurisdictional Engineer
             is         Superintending        Engineer,     Warangal    but    not
             Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar. It is stated in
             the order that since the report submitted by the
             Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar was not legally
             justified, as such, it could not have been relied on
             to finalize tender in favour of the appellant.
             14. On            the   aforesaid  grounds,    the   Division   Bench
             allowed the intra court appeal, by impugned order,
             with a direction to award the work in question, on

             be located within a distance of 100 kilometers from
             the last point of working reach, for which, bids are
             invited. As per the tender conditions, bidders are
             required to furnish necessary certificates, issued
             by the District Officers of R & B Department.
             17. It is not in dispute that the appellant owns a
             Hot Mix Plant and at the request of the appellant,
             the District Officers have issued a certificate. The
             said certificate was to be filed along with ‘Part A’
             of the documents, relating to technical bid.

             18. It             is   submitted    that,    as   per    the  tender
             conditions, the result of evaluation of Part-I of
             the        bids       shall   be  made   public    on   e-procurement

             19. It is contended that in this case, initially a
             certificate was furnished by the concerned District
             Officer of R & B Department, showing the distance
             below 100 kilometers but when a complaint is filed
             by            the       fourth     respondent/writ        petitioner,
             verification was done by calling a report from the
             Superintending Engineer, Warangal.

             distance            is   101.50    kilometers    and   by   alternate
             route, the distance is 99.90 kilometers, as per the
             Google map.
             21. It is further submitted that apart from the said
             certification, an independent report is also called
             for        from      the   Superintending    Engineer,    Karimnagar,

             concerned in the circle/division in question.
             22. It             is   submitted    by    learned      counsel    that
             accepting the report submitted by the Superintending
             Engineer, Karimnagar, the price bid was opened and
             the appellant has offered to execute the work at a
             cost          of    Rs.31,31,69,427.04,      as    against   the   cost

             Rs.31,51,27,865.82. In view of dispute raised by the
             fourth respondent, the Chief Engineer concerned has
             sought            re-verification    of   the    distance    from   the
             Superintending Engineer, R & B Circle, Karimnagar,
             who, vide report dated 04.07.2018, based on the Trip

             distance being less than 100 kilometers.
             23.          It     is   submitted     that     as    per   the   tender
             conditions,             there   is   no    prescribed    procedure   for
             verification, in the event of any complaint by one

             Constitution             of   India    as    much    as   there   is  no
             illegality or arbitrariness in the decision-making
             process.            It   is  submitted      that   the   well   reasoned
             order of the learned Single Judge is interfered in
             the intra court appeal by impugned order, without
             assigning valid reasons and findings recorded in the
             impugned              order    run     contrary      to    the    tender
             conditions.

             following judgments:

             further           submitted    that    the    Chief   Engineer   has
             committed           error   in  calling     the   report   from  the
             Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, who is not the
             concerned           jurisdictional      Superintending     Engineer.
             When           it   is   found    that,    as    per   the   initial
             certificate submitted by the appellant, which shows
             the distance to be more than 100 kilometers, there
             is no reason or justification either to go by the
             distance, as measured from the alternate route in
             the report dated 30.05.2018, or to go by another
             report of the Chief Engineer, which is based on the
             information             furnished      by     the    Superintending
             Engineer, Karimnagar.

             29. From a reading of the tender conditions relating
             to work in question, it is clear that the bidders
             shall exhibit proof of owning “Batch Type Hot Mix
             Plant” of capacity of 100-120 TPH and such plant
             shall be located within a distance of 100 kilometers
             from the last point of working reach, for which,
             bids are invited. In proof of owning such a plant
             within            100   kilometers,    bidders   are   required    to
             obtain            necessary   certificates    from   the   concerned
             District Officers of R & B Department, where such
             plants have been located and the District Officers
             of R & B Department shall inspect and certify with
             route maps on the location; distance from the last
             point of work reach; and ownership of such plants,
             for which, bidders are intending to bid. It is clear
             from           the    aforesaid   condition,    which    is   to   be
             construed as essential, that the bidder shall own a
             ‘Hot Mix Plant’ within a distance of 100 kilometers
             from the last point of working reach. As per clause
             22.6           of    the  tender    conditions,    the   result    of
             evaluation            of  Part-I   of    the bids   shall   be   made
             public            on  e-procurement    systems,   following   which,
             there shall be a period of five working days, during
                                                   16

             which, any bidder may submit complaint, which shall
             be considered, before opening Part-II of the bid. It
             is       clear        from  the   aforesaid   clause    under  tender
             document, if any of the bidder disputes the distance
             quoted by other bidder, it is open for such bidder
             to       make       a   complaint,   which   shall   be   considered,
             before            opening    of   Part-II   of   the   bid.   Once   a
             complaint is filed, there is no definite procedure
             prescribed as to how such complaint is to be dealt.
             In the case on hand, it is clear from the material
             on record that, when a complaint is filed by the
             fourth respondent/writ petitioner, after evaluation
             of Part-I of the bids, at first instance, a report
             is prepared by the Superintending Engineer, Warangal
             dated           30.05.2018,     stating   that   as  per   the  route
             given             by    the   appellant,     distance     is   101.50
             kilometers and if measured from the alternate route
             it comes to 99.90 kilometers. At this stage, it is
             to be mentioned that, it is the specific case of the
             appellant             that  it   has  not   made   any   request   for
             measuring the distance from the alternate route. In
             view of the variation in distance, from its earlier
             report, it appears, the Chief Engineer has requested
                                                   17

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             the Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, to verify
             and report. The Superintending Engineer, vide his
             report dated 04.07.2018, informed the Chief Engineer
             that           he   has    measured    the    distance    from   the
             ‘odometer’           and   the  distance    between   the   Hot  Mix
             Plant and the last point of working reach was 98.1
             kilometers. Accepting the said report, bid of the
             appellant was opened and it is clear from the record
             that the appellant has quoted offer to execute the
             work in question at Rs.31,31,69,427.04 whereas, the
             fourth respondent has quoted at Rs.31,51,27,865.82
             to execute the work. The offer of the appellant is
             nearly Rupees Twenty Lakh less than the rate quoted
             by the fourth respondent/writ petitioner.
             30. The           learned    Single   Judge,   by   observing   that
             there           being   no  specific     mala  fides   against   any
             individual,            has    held   that,    no    fault   can   be
             attributed           to   the  Chief    Engineer   in   getting  the
             re-verification done, by obtaining a report from the
             independent            authority.    Further,     by   recording   a
             finding that the scope of interference in the matter
             relating to tenders, in exercise of power conferred
             under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is
                                                  18

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             confined            to    decision-making    process     only,   has
             dismissed the Writ Petition.
             31. From a reading of the impugned order, it appears
             that the Division Bench has reversed the order of
             the learned Single Judge, only on the ground that
             the           report      received    from    the    Superintending
             Engineer, Karimnagar, is not in accordance with the
             procedure. The Division Bench of the High Court has
             also held that the Chief Engineer had stepped out of
             his jurisdiction, when he called a report from the
             Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar.
             32. We            are  not   convinced,   with   such  a   view,  as
             expressed above, by the Division Bench of the High
             Court. First of all, it is to be noticed that there
             is no dispute that appellant owns a ‘Hot Mix Plant’,
             as      required        in  the   tender  conditions.    It  is  his
             specific           case   that   the  location   of  such   Hot  Mix
             Plant is within 100 kilometers, as required. It is
             true that when a complaint is made by the fourth
             respondent/writ petitioner, it was found that the
             distance           is   101.50  kilometers   from   one   route  and
             99.90           kilometers    from   the  other   route.   From  the
             alternate             route,    shown    in   the    report    dated
                                                   19

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             30.05.2018,               submitted     by    the     Superintending
             Engineer, Warangal, it is at a distance less than
             100 kilometers.
             33. We            find    nothing   wrong  in   the   first  report,
             mentioning the distance from the alternate route. In
             view of such discrepancy in the report, the Chief
             Engineer has further called for a report from the
             Superintending Engineer, Karimnagar, an independent
             authority, who has further, after re-verification,
             submitted a report dated 04.07.2018, stating that
             the distance is only 98.1 kilometers. To make sure
             whether the plant of the appellant is within the
             distance of 100 kilometers or not, in compliance of
             the tender conditions, in view of the dispute raised
             by       the       fourth   respondent/writ    petitioner   and  the
             report            dated    30.05.2018,   the   Chief   Engineer  got
             re-verified              from    an   independent     authority   by
             addressing            to   Superintendent    Engineer,   Karimnagar.
             In         absence        of    any   prescribed     procedure   for
             verification, it was fair on the part of the Chief
             Engineer to call for a report from an independent
             Superintending               Engineer   i.e.   the    Superintending
             Engineer, Karimnagar. There is no definite procedure
                                                   20

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             for verification in the event of any complaint filed
             by any of the bidders, as contemplated under clause
             22.6 of the tender conditions. The Division Bench
             has committed an error, in recording a finding that,
             calling            for   a   report    from    the    Superintending
             Engineer, Karimnagar, by the Chief Engineer, is not
             in accordance with the procedure.
             34. Having regard to the nature of dispute, it was
             always open for the Chief Engineer to call for a
             report            from     an    independent       authority     i.e.
             Superintending              Engineer,      Karimnagar.      Such    a
             procedure adopted by the Chief Engineer was fair and
             cannot be said to be either illegal or arbitrary.
             Such a report is made basis in the decision-making
             process,            to  open   the  bid     of  the    appellant   in
             Part-II.
             35. In the case of Tata Cellular v. Union of India1,
             while considering the scope of judicial review, in
             matters           relating    to  Government    contracts-tenders,
             this Court has held that the State’s decision/action
             must           be    in  consonance     of   Article    14   of   the
             Constitution            of  India.   The   scope    is  confined   to
             examine only the decision-making process and not the
                                                  21

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             merits of the decision itself. It is specifically
             held that courts cannot sit as appellate court while
             exercising power of review in matters relating to
             contracts and tenders.
             36. In the case of Afcons Infrastructure Limited v.
             Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited and Another3,
             this          Court   found   fault    in the   High  Court,  in
             interfering with the decision of the authority in a
             matter relating to contracts and tenders, without
             there           being  any   mala  fides  or   irrationality  or
             perversity            in   the    procedure   adopted   by   the
             authorities.
             37. In the case of Consortium of Titagarh Firema
             Adler v. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.4, while
             considering the scope of judicial review, in matters
             relating to power of contracts, this Court has held
             that exercise of power of judicial review is called
             for, if the approach is arbitrary or mala fide or
             procedure adopted is meant to favour someone.
             38. Further, in the case of Municipal Corporation,
             Ujjain and Anr. v. BVG India Ltd. & Ors.5, this Court
             has         held    that,   while   considering   the  scope  of
             judicial review, in matters relating to contracts,
                                                 22

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             it        is       held     that   the     same    is    restricted    to
             decision-making process but not the decision itself.
             It       is       held    that   the   High    Court    cannot    act  as
             appellate court to review tender evaluation and set
             aside the award of tender.
             39. All the judgments referred above, support the
             case of the appellant, as much as, we are of the
             view          that    the    procedure   adopted     by   the   tendering
             authority is fair, just and reasonable. In absence
             of any specific mala fides and grant of exemption
             from any essential conditions of tender, authorities
             have          acted      within   their     authority,     as   such,  it
             cannot            be   construed     either     as   a   relaxation    or
             violation of tender conditions.
             40.             The     learned    senior     counsel,      Sri   Basant,
             appearing for the fourth respondent/writ petitioner,
             has relied on the judgments in the case of Poddar
             Steel Corporation v. Ganesh Engineering Works7, BSN
             Joshi & SWons Ltd. v. Nmair Coal Services Ltd. and
             Ors8 Bakshi Security and Personnel Services Pvt. Ltd.
             v.       Devkishan         Computed   Private     Limited     and  Ors.9;
             Central Coalfields Limited and others v. SLL-SML and
             others10,            in   support    of    his   arguments      that  the
                                                     23

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             essential           clauses  of   a  tender   should  be  enforced
             strictly and no deviation is permissible under law.
             41. We are of the view that the above said judgments
             have no application to the facts of this case, for
             the reason that, it is not a case of violation of
             any        tender     conditions.    Further,   pleading   that  no
             case is made out by the appellant for interference
             under           Article  136   of   the  Constitution   of   India,
             learned           counsel,  in   support   of  his  argument,   has
             relied on judgment in the case of Pritam Singh v.
             State11; Penu Balakrishna Iyer & Ors. v. Ariya M.
             Ramaswamy Iyer & Ors.12; Shaikh Ali Hossain & Ors. v.
             Shaikh Showkat Ali & Anr.13
             42. With reference to the same, it is to be noticed
             that          the    power  conferred    on   this   Court,   under
             Article 136 of the Constitution of India, is the
             corrective jurisdiction to settle the law. Further,
             it is to be noticed that when the learned Single
             Judge of the High Court has found that the process
             of re-verification done by the Chief Engineer, on
             the dispute in question, is fair and acceptable for
             arriving at a decision, but the Division Bench has
             set aside such order, only on the ground that the
                                                  24

C.A.@S.L.P.(c) No.8185 of 2019
             report            is   called   for     from   the    Superintending
             Engineer,            Karimnagar,    who    is   not   the   concerned
             Engineer, as per the procedure. In absence of any
             prescribed procedure to deal with complaints, it was
             fair on the part of the Chief Engineer, in calling a
             report from the independent authority, other than
             the jurisdictional officers. As the issue does not
             relate            to    strict    construction      of    territorial
             jurisdiction,              it    is     always     open     for   the
             decision-making authority, to have a report from the
             independent             authority,    to    arrive    at    the  just
             decision.
             43. Further, in the case of Management of Narendra &
             Company Pvt. Ltd. v. Workmen of Narendra & Company 14,
             while           considering    the   scope    of  the   intra   court
             appeal, this Court has held that, unless Appellate
             Bench concludes that findings of the learned Single
             Judge are perverse, it shall not disturb the same.
             44. For the aforesaid reasons, we allow this appeal
             and set aside the order dated 13.03.2019 passed in
             Writ Appeal No. 153 of 2019, by the High Court of
             Telangana at Hyderabad and confirm the order dated
