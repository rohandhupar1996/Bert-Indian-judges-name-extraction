                                         WRIT APPEAL NO.175 of 2017
                                  BEFORE
           HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
             HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
22.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr. SK Goswami, learned counsel for the appellants.
        Mr. RKD Choudhdury, learned Additional Senior Government
        Advocate, Assam for the respondents.
        Heard on admission.
        This appeal is directed against the interim order dated
14.6.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court,
whereby he has recalled its earlier stay order dated 17.3.2017 in
WP(C) No.1531/2017.
        In WP(C) No.1531/2017, the appellants have challenged the
appointment of Respondent No.3 on the post of Administrative Officer
in the office of Deputy Commissioner, Nalbari. Initially, vide order
dated 17.3.2017, the learned Single Judge stayed the appointment of
Respondent No.3, but later, on his application, has recalled that order
by the impugned order.
        Admittedly, the writ petition of appellants is yet to be decided
on merit. If the writ petition is eventually allowed, the appointment of
Respondent No.3 will be set aside. But till the decision of writ petition,
there is no justification to stall the appointment of Respondent No.3.
We, therefore, find no good ground to interfere with the impugned
order. Needless to mention that the appointment of Respondent No.3
on the post of Administrative Officer shall be subject to outcome of the
final decision of appellants’ writ petition.
        With the above observation, the appeal is dismissed summarily.
            JUDGE                                    CHIEF JUSTICE
