                              Crl. Pet. No. 127 of 2016
                                          BEFORE
                HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
13.07.2017
             Heard Mr. S.C. Biswas, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Mr.
    BB Gogoi, learned Addl. P.P. for the State and Mr. A. Kundu, learned counsel for
    the informant/ respondent No.2.
             The petitioner, namely, Gobinda Mondal is a charge sheeted accused in
    Bijni Police Station Case No. 235/2013 (corresponding to GR No. 484/2013) under
    Sections 448/376/506 IPC and the said proceeding is presently pending before the
    learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate (M) at Bijni, district-. The petitioner
    herein submitted that in the Chargesheet No. 134/2014 dated 28.09.2014 filed in
    said Bijni P.S. Case No. 235/2013, he has been shown as an absconder though
    police never visited his house in search of him and further, the medical report of
    the victim did not disclose anything regarding the sign of rape or any violence on
    her person. As such, the accused petitioner has filed this criminal petition praying
    for quashing of the Chargesheet No. 134/2014 dated 28.9.2014 filed in said Bijni
    P.S. Case No. 235/2013 (corresponding to GR No. 484/2013).
             Perused the FIR dated 18.09.2013 lodged by the victim as well as her
    statement dated 04.10.2013 recorded under Section 164 CrPC wherein the victim
    implicated the accused/petitioner for the offences under sections 448/376/506
    IPC. Though the Investigating Officer in the said Chargesheet dated 28.09.2014
    pertaining to said Bijni P.S. Case No. 235/2013 had shown the accused petitioner
    as an absconder, but the learned SDJM, Bijni issued summons to the petitioner for
    his appearance. However, in spite of receiving summons from the Court of
    learned SDJM, Bijni in said GR Case No. 484/2013, the accused/petitioner on
    numerous pretexts, did not appear before him and took time on the dates fixed.
             Whether the medical report reveals that there is any sign of any rape or
    violence on the person of the victim, can be considered only during the trial while
    recording evidence, both oral and documentary. A heinous and serious offence
    Crl. Ptn. No. 127 of 2016                                             Page 1 of 2

like rape is not private in nature and it has a serious impact on the society. The
victim in her statement before the learned Magistrate made under Section 164
Cr.P.C. clearly implicated the petitioner with regard to the offence alleged in said
Bijni P.S. Case No. 235/2013. Further, the FIR of the said Bijni P.S. Case No.
235/2013 also reveals that prior to the said incident, in an another incident, prior
to the present occurrence, the accused/petitioner molested the victim and for
that, a village bichar was held about 5/6 months prior to the date of the present
incident.
         Considering the above, the court is of the view that it is not a fit case to
exercise the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside and quash the
proceeding of the said GR Case No. 484/2013 arising out of Bijni P.S. Case No.
235/2013 registered under sections 448/376/506 IPC.
         As such being devoid of merit, this criminal petition stands rejected.
Consequently, the interim order passed earlier on 25.02.2016 stands vacated.
         The accused/petitioner is directed to appear before the learned SDJM, Bijni
in said GR Case No. 484/2013 forthwith as the trial of the said case needs to be
conducted by the Court of Sessions, as Section 376 IPC is triable by the Court of
Sessions.
                                                                    JUDGE
