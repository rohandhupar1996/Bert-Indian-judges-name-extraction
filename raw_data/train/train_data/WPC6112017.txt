2.     The Inland Water Transport Department, Assam, is responsible for
operating three Ferry Services from Neamati to Majuli out of which
Neamati-Kamalabari Ferry Service is one of them. On expiry of the
existing lease for the year 2014-15 the respondent Inland Water
Transport (I.W.T.) Department had floated a tender for settlement of
the Neamati-Kamalabari Ferry Service by publishing the notice dated
13.12.2014 in      the   vernacular daily newspaper i.e. the Dainik
Janambhumi. Since only two tenders were received in response to the
notice dated 13.12.2014, hence, the tender process was called off by
the department and the re-tender notice dated 25.02.2015 was
issued. Pursuant to the notice dated 25.02.2015, an order of settlement
dated 18.06.2015 was issued in favour of one Om Prakash Agarwalla.
The said order of settlement dated 18.06.2015 was challenged before
this Court in WP(C) No.3697/2015. Taking note of the fact that
settlement granted in favour Om Prakash Agarwalla had been
withdrawn      by   the    department during  the  pendency     of   the
proceeding, this Court had passed an order dated 04.09.2015
disposing of the writ petition with a direction to the departmental
authorities to process the settlement by inviting fresh tender and
complete the same within a period of two months. In terms of the
order dated 04.09.2014, a fresh tender notice dated 25.09.2015 was
issued by the authorities for settlement of the Neamati-Kamalabari
Ferry Service but the said NIT was also challenged before this Court by
filing WP(C) No.6302/2015 and WP(C) No.574/2016. By order dated
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                             Page 2 of 9

01.08.2016 this Court had disposed of both these writ petitions with a
direction upon the department to publish a fresh tender notice for
settlement of the Neamati-Kamalabari Ferry Service by bearing in
mind the schedule of rate that was notified on 27.08.2010. In terms of
the directions contained in the order dated 01.08.2016 the respondent
No.5 had issued re-tender notice dated 29.09.2016 inviting bids for
settlement of the Ferry Service but had later cancelled the said notice
vide order dated 17.10.2016. Thereafter, again on 06.12.2016 a re-
tender notice was issued for settlement of the Neamati-Kamalabari
Ferry Service for the remaining period of the financial year 2016-17
fixing the value of the “Ghat” at Rs.1,32,35,000/-.
3.      Responding to the NIT dated 06.12.2016 the petitioner, besides
five other tenderers, had submitted their bids. On opening of the
tenders, the rate quoted by the petitioner emerged as the highest
offer. According to the petitioner, under the rules, the petitioner was
entitled to an order of settlement on the basis of its offered rate but
the authorities did not take any action for awarding the settlement in
favour of the petitioner.
4.      It is pertinent to mention here that earlier, one Kumud Das had
challenged the NIT dated 06.12.2016 by filing WP(C) No.7738/2016
before this Court wherein an interim order dated 20.12.2016 was
passed by this Court restraining the respondents from opening the
tenders. It appears from the record that despite the interim order
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                               Page 3 of 9

dated     20.12.2016,    the   respondents had   opened    the   tenders
apparently due to a communication gap. Subsequently, WP(C)
No.7738/2016 was dismissed on withdrawal. After the dismissal of
WP(C) No.7738/2016, the petitioner was expecting an order of
settlement in its favour, but was surprised to know about the office
order dated 25.01.2017 issued by the Commissioner & Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Transport Department, communicating the
decision of the Government to operate all the three Majuli based Ferry
Services departmentally, under the direct superintendence of the
District Magistrates of Majuli and Jorhat with immediate effect until a
policy decision was in place for proper management and operation
of Majuli based Ferry Services. The result of the Government order
dated 25.01.2017 was that no order of settlement was issued in favour
of the petitioner. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner firm had
approached this Court by filing WP(C) No.611/2017 assailing the order
dated 25.01.2017 with a further prayer for directing the respondents to
issue the order of settlement of the Ferry Service in favour of the
petitioner.
5.      During the pendency of WP(C) No.611/2017, the Inland Water
Transport Department had started running the Neamati Kamalabari
Ferry Service departmentally. In order to further streamline the
operation of the Ferry Services, the respondent No.5 i.e. the Executive
Engineer, Inland Water Transport Division, Dibrugarh, Assam, had
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                               Page 4 of 9

published the Expression of Interest (EoI) dated 10.02.2017 invited offers
from reputed boat owners for operation of their Wooden Single Boats
in the two Majuli based Ferry Services, viz., Neamati-Kamalabari and
Cinnatoli-Bogoriguri-Neamati Ferry Services under the I.W.T. Division,
Dibrugarh. Thereafter, the respondent No.5 had issued an office order
dated 15.02.2017 cancelling the tender of Neamati-Kamalabari Ferry
Service. Aggrieved by the EoI dated 10.02.2017 as well as the office
order dated 10.02.2017 the petitioner had approached this Court by
filing WP(C) No.1705/2017.
6.      Mr. Borthakur, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that
the only reason why the tender was cancelled and a decision was
taken to run the Ferry Service departmentally is to deprive the
petitioner of the fruits of the tender process. Mr. Borthakur further
submits that there was no justification for the departmental authorities
to run the Ferry Services departmentally ignoring the high price offered
by the petitioner merely on the basis of some frivolous complaints
allegedly made by the public which were not even verified through a
proper enquiry process. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that even assuming that the departmental authorities were justified in
operating the Ferry Services departmentally, yet, the Control and
Management of Ferries Rules, 1968 (hereinafter ‘the Rules of 1968’)
does not permit the Government to allow private boat operators to
run the Ferry Services without floating any tender or public auction
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                                Page 5 of 9

and to that extent the EoI issued by the department is in direct
contravention of the provisions of the Rules of 1968. In support of his
aforementioned arguments, Mr. Borthakur has relied upon a decision
of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Narendra Prosad Singh vs.
State of West Bengal and others reported in AIR 1957 Cal 98 to
contend that if a public ferry is leased out it can only be done by way
of public auction on such terms as the Magistrate, with the approval
of the Commissioner, directs. Mr. Borthakur submits that since the Rules
prescribe a procedure for leasing out ferry services, the departmental
authorities could not have issued the EoI and resorted to the present
procedure so as to subvert the scheme of the Rules.
7.     Resisting the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner,
Mr. Y. Doloi, learned Additional Advocate General, Assam, has invited
the attention of this Court to the communications dated 20.10.2016
issued    from     the   Chief Minister'’ Secretariat    and   also    the
communication dated 24.01.2017 issued by the I.W.T. authorities to
contend that taking note of public complaints received on regular
basis regarding the exorbitant fares charged by the lessees of ferry
services and also in view of the safety concerns involved in the matter,
the Government had taken a policy decision to operate the three
vital Ferry Services, viz., Neamati-Kamalabari Ferry Service, Aphala-
Neamati Ferry Service and Cinatoli-Bogoriguri-Neamati Ferry Service
departmentally. Since ferry service is the only available mode of
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                               Page 6 of 9

transportation to Majuli Island, in order to streamline the transportation
system for the benefit of the public, a decision was taken to allow
private boat operators to operate Ferry Services on condition of
payment of tolls to the Government and every boat owner who meets
the requirements laid down in the EoI would get a licence to operate
the Single Wooden Boat as per the Government decision. Mr. Doloi
submits that the decision to operate the Ferry Services departmentally
has been taken bearing the public interest in mind making an open
offer to all boat owners and the said decision cannot be termed as
arbitrary or discriminatory. Under the circumstances, Mr. Doloi has
prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions with exemplary cost.
8.      I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel
for the parties and have also examined the materials available on
record.
9.      From a perusal of the counter-affidavit filed by the department,
it is apparent that the authorities had taken a decision in principle to
operate the Ferry Services through the department and that is the
reason why the process initiated on the basis of NIT dated 06.12.2016
was not taken to its logical conclusion. The mere fact that the tenders
were opened and the petitioner had emerged as the highest bidder
would not confer any indefeasible right upon the petitioner to get the
settlement order and therefore, no right of the petitioner can be
enforced in the present writ proceeding in so far as the NIT dated
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                                 Page 7 of 9

06.12.2016 is concerned. Even after opening of the tenders the
departmental authorities would be well within their jurisdiction and
competence to abandon the tender process for good and sufficient
reasons. As noted above, I find that there were valid reasons for the
departmental authorities to take a decision of operating the Ferry
Services departmentally and the said decision cannot be termed as
arbitrary and illegal in the facts and circumstances of the case. It is
also to be noted herein that the period for which the NIT dated
06.12.2016 was issued had also come to an end on 31.03.2017.
10.    Coming to the second limb of challenge made by the petitioner
to the EoI dated 10.02.2017, I find that the respondent No.5 had issued
the same inviting response from reputed boat owners of the area who
are interested to operate their wooden boats as Ferry Service on
condition of payment of toll to the Government. From a minute
scrutiny of the terms and conditions contained in the EoI it is apparent
that find no settlement of the ferry service has been awarded in favour
of any private party through the aforementioned EoI but the same is
merely an arrangement made by the department to further streamline
and strengthen the transportation system to the Majuli Island by
enforcing stringent safety norms. It is also not in dispute that the I.W.T.
department is still operating the Neamati-Kamalabari Ferry Service
through the departmental vessels.
WP(C) Nos.611/2017 & 1705/2017                                Page 8 of 9

11.    As per Section 4(b) of the Northern India Ferries Act, 1878, the
local Government would be authorised to take possession of private
ferry and declare it to be public ferry. Rule 4(1) of the Rules of 1968
also permits the Government to manage ferries which could not be
settled either by public auction or by calling for tenders, with the
approval of the Government. In view of the above provisions contains
in the Rules, it cannot be said that the EoI published on 10.02.2017 is
contrary to the provisions of law.
12.     It is no doubt true that in matters of public auction the
departmental authorities would be required to follow a fair and
transparent process. But, as has been mentioned above, the present
is not a case where the respondent authorities had acted with any
degree of unfairness or in a discriminatory manner while deciding to
operate the Ferry Services departmentally. The petitioner has also
failed to substantiate the allegations of malafide brought against the
authorities.
13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I am of the view that both
the writ petitions are devoid of any merit and the same are
accordingly dismissed. However, having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, the parties to bear their own costs.
