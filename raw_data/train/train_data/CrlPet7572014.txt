                             Crl. Pet. No. 757 of 2014
                                         BEFORE
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
03.08.2017
            Heard Mr. Pran Bora, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner.      Also
    heard Ms. Shamima Jahan, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for the
    State, respondent No. 1 and Ms. Minakshi Bujarbaruah, learned counsel for the
    informant/opposite party No. 2.
    2)      The petitioner herein is a charge-sheeted accused in All Women Police
    Station Case No. 70/2012, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 6951/2012, now
    pending before the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (Sadar) No. II,
    Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati.
    3)      As an informant the opposite party No. 2, wife of Dr. Rajiv T.P., on
    27.06.2012 lodged an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of the All Women Police
    Station, Guwahati requesting the authority to register a criminal case against her
    husband said Dr. Rajiv T.P. under Sections 494/326/420/468 IPC, for bigamy and
    for causing injury to her, her widowed mother and their daughter, which was
    accordingly registered as All Women P.S. Case No. 70/2012, corresponding to G.R.
    Case No. 6951/2012.
    4)      After completion of the investigation the Officer-in-Charge of said police
    station on 28.02.2013 submitted the Charge-Sheet vide No. 7/2013 in said All
    Women P.S. Case No. 70/2012 (corresponding to G.R. Case No. 6951/2012),
    against the accused Rajiv T.P., wherein, it is stated that sufficient evidence were
    found for committing offence by him under Sections 498-A/325/417/497 IPC and
    with regard to the present accused petitioner. It is stated in the said Charge-Sheet
    that materials have been found regarding her involvement for the offence under
    Section 417 IPC.
    5)      On receipt of the said Charge-Sheet, after perusal of the same, the Chief
    Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati, by his order dated 09.07.2013

passed in said G.R. Case No. 6951/2012 (arising out of said All Women P.S. Case
No. 70/2012) took cognizance of the offences under Sections 498A/325/417/497
IPC against both of the accused persons of the case, including the present
petitioner and Dr. Rajiv T.P. and by the said order dated 09.07.2013, the said CJM
issued summons to both of them fixing 23.09.2013 for their appearance in the said
G.R. Case and transferred the matter to the Court of the learned Sub-Divisional
Judicial Magistrate (Sadar) No. II, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati for disposal of the
same.
6)      Being aggrieved with the same, the petitioner/the other accuse persons of
said All Women P.S. Case No.70/2012 filed this criminal petition praying for setting
aside and quashing the said Charge-Sheet No. 7/2013 dated 28.02.2013 in G.R.
Case No. 6951/2012, arising out of All Women P.S. Case No. 70/2012 as well as the
order dated 09.07.2013 passed in said G.R. Case No. 6951/2012 taking cognizance
of the offences under Sections 498A/325/417/497 IPC against her and summons
issued to her in the said GR Case.
7)      Considered the submissions of the parties.
8)      From the FIR of said All Women P.S. Case No.70/2012, it is seen that the
informant Opposite Party No. 2 did not raise any allegation except making a
statement that the accused petitioner is threatening her to give divorce to her
husband accused Dr. Rajiv T.P. and the FIR of the case, excepting the same, did
not contain any other allegation, including the allegation under Section 417 of the
IPC, which relates to punishment for cheating. The ingredients of Section 417 IPC
are that :-
        (i)   The accused voluntarily or dishonestly induced the complainant,
        (ii)  The accused did so for delivery of some property either to the accused
              or some other person,
        (iii) The accused intentionally induced the complainant to do a thing which
              the complainant would not do or omit to do-a thing which the
              complainant would have done if not induced,
        (iv)  Such act cause was likely to cause some damage or harm to the
              complainant’s body, mind, reputation or property.
9)      Further from the FIR lodged by the informant/opposite party No. 2 on
27.06.2012 as well as the Charge-Sheet filed in the case, it can be seen that both

the FIR and the Charge-Sheet do not reflect any substantive materials regarding
commission of any offence by the accused petitioner under Section 417 IPC.
Moreover, it is also seen that neither in the FIR nor in the Charge-Sheet of the
case, there is any allegation against the petitioner herein regarding her involvement
to the allegation under Section 325 IPC, which relates to punishment for voluntarily
causing grievous hurt as well as the Section under Section 498-A IPC of subjecting
cruelty by the accused petitioner on the informant/opposite party No. 2. With
regard to Section 497 IPC, the same relates to adultery and it is settled that only a
man can be punished for the offence of adultery. Section 497 IPC expressly
provides that wife cannot be punished under this Section even as an abettor.
10)     From the above it is observed that while taking cognizance of the offences
by his order dated 09.07.2013 passed in said G.R. Case No. 6951/2012, the learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati did not apply his judicious
mind and issued summons to the petitioner mechanically. Moreover, there are no
such materials in the Charge-Sheet for commission of any such offences by the
accused petitioner under Section 417 IPC nor there is any allegation against her by
the informant opposite party No. 2 for commission of such offences by the said
petitioner.
11)     For the reasons above, the Court is of the view that if the proceeding of
said G.R. Case No. 6951/2012 arising out of All Women P.S. Case No. 70/2012
against the petitioner under Sections 498A/325/417/497 IPC on the basis of the
said Charge-Sheet No. 07/2012 dated 28.02.2013, which is presently pending
before the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate No. II, Kamrup (M), Guwahati
if allowed to continue, it would be an abuse of the process of the Court. As such,
for the ends of justice, in exercise of the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the
proceeding of said G.R. Case No.6951/2012 against the petitioner, including the
Charge-Sheet No. 07/2012 dated 28.02.2013 filed in the said GR Case as well as
the order dated 09.07.2013 passed in said G.R. Case No. 6951/2012 taking
cognizance of the offences under Sections 498A/325/417/497 IPC against the
petitioner are hereby set aside and quashed.
12)     This criminal petition is accordingly allowed.

13)     The interim order passed earlier in this case on 15.06.2015 with regard to
the petitioner stands merged with this order.
14)     Registry shall return the LCR along with a copy of this order to the Court of
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (Sadar) No. II, Kamrup (Metro),
Guwahati.
