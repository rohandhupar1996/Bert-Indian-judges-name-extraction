                                                  WA No.134 of 2017
                               BEFORE
         HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
            HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
31.7.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr. RM Choudhury, learned counsel for the appellant.
        Mr.R Dhar, learned Additional Senior Government Advocate,
        Assam and Mr. SP Bhattacharjee, learned Standing Counsel,
        Education Department for the Respondents.
        Heard on admission.
        This intra court appeal is directed against the order dated
9.12.2016 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court
whereby he has dismissed appellant’s WP(C) No.7268/2016.
        Appellant’s father worked as Assistant Teacher in a Middle
English School and he died on 17.04.1994 while in service. At that
time, the appellant was aged about only one year. After about 22
years, the appellant filed WP(C) No.7268/2016 for a direction that her
case be placed before the District Level Committee for compassionate
appointment.
        The learned Single Judge by the impugned order has
dismissed the writ petition on the ground that a claim of “dependant
family member” for compassionate appointment after 22 years does
not arise.
        After hearing the learned counsel for the appellant, we find
ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned
Single Judge.
        The appeal has no merit and is accordingly dismissed
summarily.
        JUDGE                                    CHIEF JUSTICE
