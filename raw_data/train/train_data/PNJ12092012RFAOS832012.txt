       Allowed.
RFA(OS) 83/2012
1.            The record of the suit has been summoned and perused.
2.            Shravan Kapur, his minor sister Sakshi Kapur (through her next
friend Neelu Kapur) and their mother Neelu Kapur filed a suit seeking
partition of the assets of the Joint Hindu Family in which they impleaded
only 6 defendants; defendants No.1 to 5 being the three sons of Diwan Kapur,
Diwan Kapur himself and his wife Sudershan Kapur. Defendant No.6 was a
person to whom one of the many joint family properties was stated to be sold.

3.            Later on, daughters of Lajia Ram Kapur, the common ancestor
of the parties were impleaded as defendants No.7 to 11. But, the pleadings in
the suit continued to be the same i.e. as per the plaint only the plaintiffs and
defendants No.1 to 5 had a share in the joint family properties. The newly
impleaded parties i.e. the daughters of Lajia Ram Kapur did not file any
written statement. Applications filed by them to condone the delay in filing
the written statements were dismissed vide order dated September 15, 2010
recording:-
         “The learned counsel for defendants No.7 to 11 seeks to
         withdraw the captioned applications with liberty to file a
         fresh proceedings with regard to the properties mentioned
         in the plaint.”
4.            In other words, there was no defence from the side of defendants
No.7 to 11 to oppose the prayer made in the suit requiring any issues to be
settled with respect to the pleadings in the plaint qua said defendants.
5.            The plaintiffs and defendants No.1 to 5 entered into a settlement
and in terms thereof the learned Single Judge disposed of the suit as per order
dated September 20, 2010, which on being challenged in RFA(OS)
No.98/2010, resulted in the matter being remanded to the learned Single
Judge for re-deciding the application filed under Order XXIII Rule 3 by the
plaintiffs and defendants No.1 to 5 on the issue of right of defendants No.7 to
11; defendant No.6 being given up.
6.            Vide impugned order dated August 30, 2012 the learned Single
Judge has opined that as per the pleadings in the suit and the prayers made
therein and the traverse to the pleadings only by defendants No.1 to 5, and
there being no traverse to the pleadings by defendants No.7 to 11, requires it
to be held that no issue has to be settled inter-se the plaintiffs and defendants
RFA(OS) 83/2012                                                  Page 2 of 4

No.7 to 11, and as regards the other defendants, noting that defendant No.6
has been dropped from the array of defendants and defendants No.1 to 5 have
entered into a settlement, the suit would be decreed in terms of the
compromise effected, but has clearly observed that the rights of defendants
No.7 to 11 would obviously be in terms of the order dated September 15,
2010, in which the counsel for said defendants is recorded to have made a
statement that his clients would be at liberty to file proceedings as per law.
7.            We agree with the reasoning of the learned Single Judge for the
reason as per pleadings in the suit no relief is claimed against defendants
No.7 to 11 who were not even impleaded as parties in the suit. Since the
estate of the joint Hindu family was traced since the days of late Lajia Ram
Kapur who had only one son, Diwan Kapur (impleaded as defendant No.4),
as per the plaint the joint family would be consisting of Lajia Ram Kapur, his
son Diwan Kapur and the sons of Diwan Kapur.
8.            In the absence of defendants No.7 to 11 asserting any right by
filing a written statement as the daughters of Lajia Ram Kapur and claiming a
deemed partition on his death and then staking a claim to the share of Lajia
Ram Kapur to be inherited by succession, the learned Single Judge is correct
in opining that the suit would be disposed of as per the compromise between
the contesting defendants.
9.            But what happens to the right of defendants No.7 to 11 to stake a
claim in the joint family properties, questions the learned counsel for the
appellants?
10.           When told that the appellants have already been granted a right
to institute a proceedings and have the right determined as observed by the
learned Single Judge in the order dated September 15, 2010, which we note
RFA(OS) 83/2012                                                 Page 3 of 4

has become final and has not been challenged, learned counsel for the
appellants states that the appellants would be satisfied if the Division Bench
were to observe that the compromise decree impugned does not affect the
right of the appellants.
11.           We need not so state for the reason, in the impugned order the
learned Single Judge has already clarified so.
12.           Learned counsel for the appellants says, that being satisfied, and
desirous of filing a suit, this Court should preserve the subject properties for
at least a month.
13.           There is no danger of the properties being wasted or secreted
within the next one month. Unless it is a case of a distress sale, it takes time
to find buyers and negotiate the price and then sell immovable properties.
The appellants can file a suit within the next two or three days if they sense
any danger to the properties to which they seek to lay a claim, but we
highlight as of today there is no claim because the appellants did not file any
written statement to the plaint.
14.           The appeal is accordingly dismissed in limine.
15.           No costs.
