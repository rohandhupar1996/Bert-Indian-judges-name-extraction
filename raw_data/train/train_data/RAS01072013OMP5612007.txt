CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER
RAJIV SHAKDHER, J (ORAL)
1.      The captioned petition is filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short the 1996 Act) to lay challenge to the award
dated 10.07.2007 passed by the learned Arbitrator.           The award has been
passed by late Hon‟ble Mr. Justice Arun Kumar; a retired judge of the
Supreme Court.
1.1     The sole ground on which the award has been challenged is the
absence of permission accorded by the Lt. Governor of Delhi, under Section
48(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short the L.A. Act), to withdraw
the acquisition proceedings qua the land in issue.
1.2     In this behalf it is also the stand of the petitioner, i.e., the Delhi
OMP No. 561/2007                                                        Page 1 of 15

Agricultural Marketing Board (in short the Board) that not only an order for
withdrawal of acquisition proceedings had to be passed by the Lt. Governor
but also an appropriate notification had to be issued in that behalf.          It is
submitted that the said actions having not been taken in the instant case, the
settlement which was arrived at between the parties, i.e., written agreement
dated 30.09.1988, could not have been ordered to be specifically enforced,
as has been directed by the learned Arbitrator, by way of the impugned
award.
1.3    I may note, at the very outset, that this is the only ground raised and
argued before me by the learned counsel for the petitioner to assail the
award.
2.     The facts of the case are not in dispute.      The background of facts
which have led to the filing of the present petition are broadly as follows:
2.1    Respondent no. 1, who was the original claimant before the learned
Arbitrator, claimed ownership in respect of the land admeasuring 6 bighas
10 biswas situate in khasra no. 296, 298 and 303 located in village
Mamoorpur, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the land in issue).
2.2    Apparently, the aforementioned land of respondent no. 1 was subject
matter of acquisition proceedings as a part of a larger parcel of land
admeasuring 33 acres. The acquisition proceedings in respect of the said
land, admeasuring 33 acres, was taken out by the Land Acquisition Collector
(LAC) in order to enable expansion of the new grain market, known as the
Narela Anaaj Mandi, by the Board.
2.3    It is towards this end, that a notification under Section 4 of the L.A.
Act was taken out on, 30.10.1963. The aforesaid notification was followed
by a notification under Section 6, which was taken out on 10.01.1969. An
OMP No. 561/2007                                                   Page 2 of 15

award was passed, admittedly, on 19.09.1986.         The Board claims to have
taken possession of the entire 33 acres of land including the land owned by
respondent no. 1 admeasuring 6 bighas and 10 biswas on, 22.09.1986.
2.4    There is no dispute in respect of the fact that respondent no. 1 assailed
the acquisition proceedings by filing a writ petition in this court. This writ
petition was numbered as CWP No. 149/1987. In the said writ petition an
interim order was passed by this court on, 23.01.1987. The aforesaid date,
being the first date when the writ petition was moved, this court issued
notice on the said date and, in the meanwhile, directed stay of dispossession
of respondent no. 1.
2.5    It appears that, while the writ petition was pending in this court
parleys were held between the representatives of the Board and respondent
no. 1 for arriving at an out of court settlement between them. There is no
dispute, a fact which is averred in Section 34 petition filed by the Board, that
the Board, on 22.09.1988, decided to arrive at an out of court settlement
with respondent no. 1.       It is in pursuance of this decision that, on
26.09.1988, the requisite stamp paper was purchased for reducing the
settlement to writing. The exercise of reducing the settlement to writing was
carried out on 27.09.1988. It is also not in dispute, as is averred in the
petition filed before the court that, on 29.09.1988 the matter was placed
before the Board, wherein requisite approval was granted for arriving at a
settlement.      Preliminary steps having been taken, on 30.09.1988, the
Chairman of the Board, signed the settlement agreement, on behalf of the
Board.
3.     I may only note here that, in the settlement agreement of 30.09.1988,
in clause (g), the following is noted. The reason, I am quoting the same is
OMP No. 561/2007                                                   Page 3 of 15

on account of the fact that certain submissions have been made on behalf of
the petitioner with regard to what is noted therein; an aspect which I will
deal with in the latter part of my judgment.
               “(g) That the Board which has become absolute owner of
           the said land which has also been mutated in its favour in the
           revenue record shall execute proper conveyance deed with the
           prior consent of Land Acquisition Collector at her cost in
           favour of the transferee in respect of the portion of the said
           land assigned to her by those present for a valuable
           consideration, which shall be equal to the proportionate
           compensation awarded by the land Acquisition Collector
           under the aforesaid Award dated 19.9.1986 including the
           additional interest and interest under Section 4(3) and
           solutium etc. as per award plus 12 per cent interest from the
           date of deposit of compensation money made by the Board
           with the Land Acquisition Collector till payment of the
           consideration by the transferee to the Board....”
4.     Continuing with the narrative, in view of the settlement arrived at
between the Board and respondent no. 1, the writ petition filed by
respondent no. 1, i.e., CWP No. 149/1987, was disposed of by the court vide
its order dated 05.10.1988.
4.1    Evidently, the Board re-visited the issue after obtaining legal advice.
The issue was re-considered, apparently, at the Board‟s meeting held on
24.11.1988.
4.2    Though the legal advice is not placed on record, an extract of the
resolution has been set out in the petition filed under Section 34. The sum
and substance of the resolution is that the Board appears to have been
advised that, it was not competent to transfer the land in favour of any
person (I would assume in this case respondent no. 1), without a requisite
conveyance deed being executed by the Government of India (in short GOI)
OMP No. 561/2007                                                 Page 4 of 15

in favour of the Board. It appears that the Department of Law and Delhi
Administration was also of the view that: since the land in issue stood
notified/ acquired; with the award having been pronounced; and given the
fact that possession had been taken, the land in issue, could not be de-
notified under Section 16 and 48 of the L.A. Act.
5.     It is in the background of the aforesaid decision taken at the meeting
of 24.11.1988 that the Board filed an application in the disposed of writ
petition i.e., CWP no. 149/1987, being CM No. 2239/1989, for recall of
order dated 05.10.1988. Apparently, prior to the Board‟s application for
recall, respondent no. 1 had filed two interlocutory applications in the said
writ petition being: CM Nos. 2209/1989 and 2210/1989.               By these
applications, in substance, respondent no. 1 sought implementation of the
agreement dated 30.09.1988.
5.1    The court, however, disposed of all three interlocutory applications
vide order dated 06.08.2002. In the operative part of the order passed on
06.08.2002 the court dismissed CM Nos. 2209/1989 and 2210/1989 on the
ground that they were not maintainable, while in respect of CM No.
2239/1989 it was observed that the same had been rendered infructuous.
An observation was, however, made that it would be open to respondent no.
1 to avail of a remedy; albeit in accordance with law. Similar opportunity
was given to the Board to take all objections, as may be permissible,
including the ones taken in its CM No. 2239/1989.
6.     Having regard to aforesaid, respondent no. 1 filed an arbitration
application being A.A. No. 278/2004 and a petition for stay being: OMP No.
444/2004.      Based on the aforementioned applications of respondent no. 1,
this court vide order dated 17.05.2006, appointed late Hon‟ble Mr Justice
OMP No. 561/2007                                                 Page 5 of 15

Arun Kumar as an arbitrator in the matter.                 As indicated above,
deliberations by learned Arbitrator led to the passing of the impugned
award.
7.     In the award the arbitrator framed three substantive issues. The last
and the fourth issue related to relief(s), if any. All issues have been decided
in favour of respondent no. 1 and against the Board. The arbitrator returned
findings of fact with regard to the following aspects: (i) that respondent no.
1 was owner of the land in issue; and (ii) that the Board was competent to
enter into in the settlement agreement dated 30.09.1988.
7.1    It is in the background of the findings arrived at by the learned
arbitrator qua issue nos.(i) and (ii) and based on the evidence on record, that
he has also held that the Board was liable to specifically perform the
obligations contained in the settlement agreement dated 30.09.1988,
executed with respondent no.1.
8.     Being aggrieved, the Board filed a petition under Section 34 of the
1996 Act, as indicated above, to assail the award.
9.     Ms Ahlawat, who appears for the petitioner, submits that the
impugned award deserves to be set aside for the reasons that the Board is not
in a position to release the land in issue, in favour of respondent no.1, as that
power under Section 48 of the L.A. Act vests only in the Lt. Governor. As
indicated above, in support of this submission it is submitted by Ms Ahlawat
that not only was the Lt. Governor required to direct withdrawal of the
acquisition proceedings but due notification had to be issued, which was
required to be gazetted, in accordance with law, for the Board to direct
release of the land in issue, in favour of respondent no. 1. It is submitted
that in the absence of these pre-requisites, the Arbitrator could not have
OMP No. 561/2007                                                   Page 6 of 15

directed specific performance of the settlement agreement.
9.1    To support this submission, Ms.Ahlawat relied upon clause (g) of the
settlement agreement which requires the Board to obtain “prior consent” of
the LAC before executing a conveyance deed.
10.    Mr Gupta, learned senior counsel, on the other hand, has placed
reliance on the findings of fact returned by the learned Arbitrator to contend
that since acquisition proceedings stood completed, the power under Section
48 of the L.A. Act could neither have been exercised nor was required to be
exercised, in the instant case.      Mr Gupta referred me to the various
documents filed before the learned Arbitrator to demonstrate that it was
Board‟s stand that: the acquisition proceedings were completed; paper
possession of the land was taken; and that, the land in issue, stood mutated
in favour of the Board.
10.1 Mr Gupta, in order to buttress his argument, also sought to place
reliance on an exchange deed executed by the Board qua another parcel of
land, which formed part of 33 acres of the land acquired, to demonstrate the
point that the said exchange, transfer of interest could only have been
effectuated if the Board was the owner of the entire land admeasuring 33
acres.
10.2 It is in this context, that Mr Gupta has also urged that respondent no.
1, consciously took the decision of not impleading the LAC or the GOI
before the learned Arbitrator.
10.3 Mr Gupta contended that clause (g), which finds mention in the
settlement agreement (to which I have made a reference above), would have
had significance if, acquisition proceedings were still pending. It is his
contention that, since acquisition proceedings have come to an end,
OMP No. 561/2007                                                  Page 7 of 15

consequent to which the entire land, which included the land in issue, vested
with the Board, the reference to the requirement of obtaining a No Objection
Certificate (NOC) from the LAC is, really a ministerial act, and cannot,
come in the way of the settlement agreement being specifically enforced, as
between the parties, i.e., the Board and respondent no. 1.
11.     In rejoinder, Ms Ahlawat referred me to the resolution dated
24.11.1988 to contend that, in the resolution there is a reference to the fact
that a conveyance deed needs to be executed between the GOI and the Board
for it to acquire legal title to the entire land admeasuring 33 acres, including
the land in issue.
11.1 On this aspect, I put a specific query to Ms Ahlawat as to whether in
all these years the GOI had, as a matter of fact, ever executed a conveyance
deed in favour of the Board to confer title in respect of land acquired for its
purposes.     Ms Ahlawat has fairly conceded that to her knowledge no
conveyance deed had been executed in the past. I also put to Ms Ahlawat,
as to whether, in line with what is stated in the resolution of 24.11.1988 any
evidence had been led before the learned Arbitrator.         Ms Ahlawat fairly
informed me that no evidence had been led before the learned Arbitrator,
with regard to the practice of execution of conveyance deed(s) as between
the GOI and the Board.
11.2 As a matter of fact, Mr Gupta has referred me to the deposition of the
Board‟s witness, before the learned Arbitrator, and contended, based on the
said deposition, that no such procedure of execution of conveyance deed is
adopted. Mr Gupta stressed that the witness has clearly deposed that, apart
from steps required to be taken to effectuate acquisition and the issuance of
a possession letter, no other steps are taken before vesting the ownership in
OMP No. 561/2007                                                   Page 8 of 15

land in the authority for whose purpose the acquisition proceedings are
carried out in the first instance.
12.     Having heard the learned counsels for the parties, according to me,
the challenge based on Section 48 of the L.A. Act to the impugned award,
cannot be sustained.
12.1 The facts have already been set out by me, in respect of which, there
is no dispute. It is clearly not in dispute that respondent no. 1 had assailed
the acquisition proceedings by instituting a writ petition in this court, which
was numbered as, CWP No. 149/1987. In the said writ petition an interim
order was passed in favour of respondent no. 1.
12.2 It is to be noted, a fact which is once again not in dispute, that
respondent no. 1 was claiming, at the relevant time, ownership in the land
admeasuring 6 bighas and 10 biswas. It was while, the writ petition was
pending adjudication, that the Board, arrived at a settlement with respondent
no. 1, which is reflected in the agreement dated 30.09.1988.
12.3 The sum and substance of the agreement was that, respondent no. 1
was to acquire unimpeded ownership rights qua one-half portion of the land,
over which, she claimed ownership rights before the writ court. In order
words, land admeasuring 3 bighas and 5 biswas would enure to the benefit
of respondent no. 1, while the Board would have the benefit of ownership,
and the consequential rights, flowing therefrom, in the remaining portion,
i.e., 3 bighas and 5 biswas. On this broad understanding, as indicated above,
the settlement agreement dated 30.09.1988 was executed between the Board
and respondent no. 1.
13.     The events which led to the execution of the agreement dated
30.09.1988 has already been recorded by me which are not in dispute. It
OMP No. 561/2007                                                   Page 9 of 15

was not an agreement which was entered into in hurry or without due
deliberation.     Stamp paper was bought on 26.09.1998.          The agreement
arrived at between the parties, was reduced to writing on 26.09.1988, and
the same, was duly considered by a requisite quorum of the Board, on
29.09.1988. It was only after due deliberation, that, on 30.09.1988, the then
Chairman of the Board signed the agreement on behalf of the Board.
13.1 It is no one‟s case that the Chairman did not have the authority to
execute the settlement on behalf of the Board.         It may also be noted, as
recorded in the foregoing paragraphs, that the Board all along claimed that it
was the absolute owner of the land in issue. The said aspect is clearly
reflected in clause (g) of the settlement agreement, wherein it is recorded
that the Board became absolute owner of the land in issue and that the said
land stood mutated in its favour in the revenue record.
13.2 As a matter of fact, the Board also claimed possession of the entire
land, which included the land in issue.       Ms Ahlawat at some stage stated
that what the Board had in its favour was the paper possession, while the
physical possession of the land continued with respondent no. 1.               This
aspect is not in dispute as is reflected not only in the interim order passed by
this court on 23.01.1987 but is also evident on a bare perusal of the
possession report which has been placed on record. In this behalf, I may
only refer to the possession proceedings drawn up by the officers of the
LAC. The relevant extract of the same reads as follows:
         “..... The possession of the land bearing Khasra no. 302 (3-12)
         which is within the boundary walls of the temple and where a
         big Samadhi is erected has not been, for the present, is not
         handed over. Except this possession proceedings were
         completed on the spot....”             (emphasis is mine)
OMP No. 561/2007                                                    Page 10 of 15

14.   In this background, could it be said that the Board was not the legal
owner of the land in issue, once acquisition proceedings were concluded.
To deal with this poser, I need not go further than adverting to the counter
affidavit filed by the Board in CWP No. 149/1987.          The relevant extract
reads as follows:
           “...After taking over the possession of the land, this factum
           was recorded in the Police Station Narela vide report of even
           date a copy of which is attached herewith as Annexure R-V.
           The land including the land of the petitioner has also been
           mutated in the revenue record in favour of Delhi Agricultural
           Marketing Board...”
                                                      (emphasis is mine)
14.1 The same aspect is also highlighted in the affidavit of one Mr Bansi
Dhar, filed on behalf of the Board, in CM No. 254/1987 in CWP 149/1987.
The relevant extract reads as follows:
           “.... The land of the petitioner measuring 7 bighas bearing
           Khasra No. 303 (3-0), 298 (3-0), 296 (0-10) situated in village
           Mamurpur, Narela, Delhi, has been acquired by award No.
           195/1986-87 dated 19.9.1986. The possession of the land was
           taken over by the Land Acquisition Collector and handed over
           to the Answering Respondent on the 22nd September, 1986.
           The petitioner has, therefore, no right, title or interest in the
           said land.....
           ..... The Acquisition proceedings have been completed by the
           pronouncement of the award on 19th September, 1986 and
           taking over the possession on 22nd September, 1986. It is
           denied that any balance of convenience lies in favour of the
           applicant.....”.
                                                      (emphasis is mine)
14.2 The same aspect is reiterated in another affidavit filed by Mr S.P.
Ashta, once again in the writ proceedings. The relevant extracts read as
follows:
OMP No. 561/2007                                                    Page 11 of 15

           “....The Delhi Agricultural marketing Board acquired the land
           bearing Khasra No. 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 296, 298/1,
           298/2, 302 and 303 (including the land of the petitioner)
           situated in the revenue estate of village Mumoorpur and
           adjoining the land in the revenue estate of village Khureni
           which had already been notified for acquisition under the
           Land Acquisition Act for the public purpose of “development
           of Nerala Township”. The award was announced on 19th
           September, 1986. The payment of the awarded amount was
           fully made by the Delhi Agricultural marketing Board to the
           Land Acquisition Collector before taking over the
           possession....”.
                                                     (emphasis is mine)
15.    A perusal of the stand taken by the Board before this court in the
aforesaid writ petition would clearly show that, it is the Board‟s stand that
the acquisition proceedings stand concluded and that it had acquired legal
title of the entire land, which included the land in issue. Therefore, as
rightly held by the learned Arbitrator, the only entity which was competent
to execute the settlement agreement was the Board itself. Though, there is
no evidence led that there was an amorphous suggestion made both before
me and the Arbitrator that the settlement agreement was executed by the
then Chairman of the Board with respondent no. 1 for oblique motives.
This aspect has been dealt with by the learned Arbitrator; I need not dwell
on it once more, except to say that admittedly, no evidence has been led
before the learned Arbitrator to establish the veracity of the said assertion.
The dates and events, as referred to hereinabove, belie such a charge.
Surmises and conjectures cannot supplant evidence.
16.    This brings me to the last two aspects pertaining to the necessity of
execution of a conveyance deed by the GOI in favour of the Board, and the
OMP No. 561/2007                                                 Page 12 of 15

requirement of a NOC being issued by the LAC in favour of the Board.
16.1 In so far as execution of conveyance deed is concerned, I have already
recorded, (as I was told by Ms Ahlawat in court today), there is no material
placed before the learned Arbitrator to demonstrate that such a requirement
in law, or any practice, obtained in this behalf.       As a matter of fact, as
indicated above, Mr Gupta referred me to the following deposition of the
Board‟s witness which seems to indicate that there is no requirement of the
nature sought to be banded by the Board.        The witness, who deposed, and
on whose deposition reliance is placed by Mr Gupta, was one Mr M.G.
Prabhakaran. The relevant extract from his deposition is noted hereinafter:
                “...The Narela Mandi at present, is situated on about 33
         acres of land. Since beginning, this land of 33 acres was
         acquired for setting up of the Grain Mandi. This 33 acres of
         land was comprising of the land situated in Village
         Mamoorpur and Village Kureni. It is correct to suggest that
         land of both the villages was acquired by the same acquisition
         proceeding under the Land Acquisition Act. After the
         acquisition of the land, entire land by the Land Acquisition
         Department, we were handed over the physical possession of
         the land of both the villages. A possession letter was issued
         by the Government of India in our favour and there is no other
         document. It is correct that there is no conveyance Deed
         executed by the Government of India in favour of the Board
         in regard to the land situated at Village Kureni. Volunteered –
         Only possession letter is a document executed by the
         Government in favour of the Board in regard to the Village
         Kureni. Similar is the possession letter issued by the
         Government in favour of the Board with respect to the land in
         village Mamoorpur. We have got the possession letters with
         us on record...
         ......The 51 three storeyed shops have not yet been allotted to
         any person. In future, the same shall be allotted to the traders.
         Such allotment shall be made either by the Board or by the
         Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), Narela.

         We don‟t require any permission from any government
         authority or DDA for making such allotments and such
         allotments shall be made solely by our Board only. The
         money(s) received from such allotment shall also go to the
         Board or APMC, Narela and no other person shall have any
         claim over the same. All development and affairs of the
         Mandi/ Grain Market are within the discretion of Board or
         APMC, Narela only. While making the allotments of shops,
         the allotment letters and possession letters will be issued in
         favour of the allottee by the Board or the APMC, Narela.....”

16.2 The aforesaid would clearly show, that there is no requirement of
execution of a conveyance deed by the Government. The Board acquired
the right, title and thus the ownership qua the entire 33 acres of land, which
included the land in issue and, therefore, by a logical corollary, it was
competent to enter into a settlement agreement de hors the conveyance deed
being executed in its favour by the Government, contrary to what is sought
to be contended now.        As a matter of fact, the Board had taken physical
possession of entire land save and except that portion of the land over which
respondent no. 1 claimed ownership. In respect of this land, it had what is
loosely referred to as „paper possession‟.
17.    The last aspect with regard to that which finds a mention in clause (g)
of the settlement agreement, i.e., issuance of a NOC, I am in agreement with
Mr Gupta‟s contention that a NOC by LAC is required to be issued only to
establish that there are no acquisition proceedings pending qua the land in
respect of which parties intend to execute a conveyance deed. There are no
acquisition proceedings pending in the instant case, and therefore, if at all,
issuance of a NOC by the LAC will only be a ministerial act.                  The
contention of the Board that the learned Arbitrator has, in making
OMP No. 561/2007                                                  Page 14 of 15

observation in that regard, gone beyond the scope of the arbitration,
according to me, is an argument that is untenable and hence is rejected.
18.    For the reasons given hereinabove, I find no error in the award. The
petition under Section 34 of the 1996 Act is, accordingly, dismissed. The
parties shall, however, bear their own costs.
