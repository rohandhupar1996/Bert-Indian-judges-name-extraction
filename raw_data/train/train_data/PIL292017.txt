                               BEFORE
         HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
            HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
20.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
         Mr.J Laskar, learned counsel for the petitioner.
         Mr. BN Sarma, learned senior Government Advocate,
         Assam for the Respondents.
         Heard on admission.
         In the present Public Interest Litigation, the petitioner is
aggrieved with the shifting of District Transport Office from one
area to another in Hailakandi District.
         The present District Transport Office is situated in a rented
house and now it is being shifted to another area.
         According to the petitioner, the present premises of the
District Transport Office, although on rent, has sufficient parking
area etc. whereas the place where it proposed to be shifted is
crowded and will cause great inconvenience to public.
         In which locality the District Transport Office should be
located can best be decided by the State Government and the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution should refrain
itself from interfering with such decision.
         We do not find any merit in this petition. It is accordingly
dismissed summarily.
               JUDGE                              CHIEF JUSTICE
