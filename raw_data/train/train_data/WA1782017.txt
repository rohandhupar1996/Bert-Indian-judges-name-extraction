                                     BEFORE
               HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN

(Ajit Singh, CJ)
         Mr. BK Das, learned counsel for the appellant.
         None for the respondents.
         Heard on admission.
         This appeal is directed against an interlocutory order dated 31.05.2017
passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court, whereby he has
allowed respondents’ I.A. (Civil) No. 643/2016 and vacated the stay order
dated 07.04.2016 passed in WP(C) No. 2378/2016.
         The appellant was employed by the respondent Bank as a part time
Sweeper on need basis. He then participated in the selection process for the
post of Peon-cum-House Keeper but was unsuccessful. And suppressing all
these facts, he has filed WP(C) No. 2378/2016 for regularisation of his service
as a Grade-IV employee. The learned Single Judge initially vide order dated
07.04.2016 directed that engagement of appellant as part time Sweeper shall
not be disturbed by the respondent Bank and one vacancy in Grade-IV shall
also not be filled up. But when the correct facts were brought to the notice of
learned Single Judge by the Bank vide I.A. (Civil) No. 643/2016, the stay
order dated 07.04.2016 has been recalled. Aggrieved, the appellant has filed
the present appeal.
         After hearing the learned counsel for the appellant, we find no merit in
appeal. The appellant was only a part time employee and his services were
used on need basis. Admittedly, he participated in the selection process for
the post of Peon-cum-House Keeper and was unsuccessful. He has no right to
remain in service of the Bank as part time Sweeper.
         The appeal is accordingly dismissed summarily.
                JUDGE                            CHIEF JUSTICE
