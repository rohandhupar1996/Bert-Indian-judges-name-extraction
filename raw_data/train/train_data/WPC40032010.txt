                          IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
           (High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh)
                                      WP(C) No.4003 of 2010
                                     Sri Harendra Nath Borah
                                                                   ............ Petitioner
                                             - Versus –
                                      The State of Assam and others
                                                                    ........ Respondents
                                             BEFORE
                       HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.M. BUJOR BARUA
                       For the petitioner:       Ms. R. Phukan, Adv
                       For the respondents:      Dr. B. Ahmed, Adv.
                       Date of Hearing :        10.07.2017.
                      Date of Judgment:         10.07.2017.
                          JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
              Heard Ms. R. Phukan, learned counsel for the petitioner and Dr. B.
      Ahmed, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.1. Although Mr. A.K.
      Sarma, learned counsel had appeared for the respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 4 as
      the Standing Counsel of the Assam State Co-Operative Agriculture and Rural
      Development Bank, but it is stated that in the meantime, the learned counsel
      had been appointed as a Member of the Foreigners Tribunal and as such, he
      is no longer practicing as a lawyer. It is also noticed from the order sheet that
      since the said learned Standing Counsel had been appointed as the Member
      of the Foreigners Tribunal, the respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 4 had not taken any
      required steps for appointing any other counsel to represent their case. But,
      however, an affidavit in opposition of the respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 4 dated
      29.04.2015 is found on record and as such, this Court deems it appropriate to
      proceed with the matter on the basis of the said affidavit in opposition.
WP(C) No.4003 of 2010                                                            Page 1 of 6

      2.      The petitioner was earlier serving as the Secretary of the Assam State
      Co-operative Agriculture and Land Mortgage Bank since his appointment on
      01.01.1982. Later on, the Assam State Co-operative Agriculture and Land
      Mortgage Bank was renamed as the Assam State Co-operative Agriculture and
      Rural Development Bank (in short ASCARD Bank).
      3.      While the petitioner was working as a Deputy Manager of the ASCARD
      Bank and was posted at Nagaon Branch, two employees of the bank, namely,
      Md. Hasen Ali and Late Gopal Bora were placed on voluntary retirement. The
      said act of the respondent bank in placing the said two employees on
      voluntary retirement was assailed by the two employees before this Court in
      two writ petitions being WP(C) No.2103/2001 and WP(C) No.7273/2001. The
      said two writ petitions were disposed of by the common judgment and order
      dated 14.09.2006. It is stated that by the said judgment and order of
      14.09.2006, this Court was pleased to set aside the order of voluntary
      retirement and had directed the respondent ASCARD Bank to make the
      payment of the dues to the said two employees, including the arrear pay and
      other benefits after necessary calculation. It is stated that after necessary
      calculation it was found that the respondent bank was required to pay a total
      amount of Rs.2,61,859/- in respect of Md. Hasen Ali and Late Gopal Bora.
      4.      It is stated that subsequently as per the meeting of the Board of
      Directors of the ASCARD Bank held on 25.05.2010, the amount payable to
      Md. Hasen Ali was assessed at Rs.3,72,856/-, whereas the amount payable to
      late Gopal Bora was assessed at Rs.1,99,775/-.
      5.      In the aforesaid background the order dated 22.06.2010 was passed
      by the Chief Executive Director of the ASCARD Bank whereby an amount of
      Rs.8,83,319/- had been ordered to be recovered from the present petitioner
      from his monthly salary @ 25% of his salary. Being aggrieved, the petitioner
      prefers this writ petition. It is also stated that in the meantime, the petitioner
      has superannuated from service in the month of December, 2016.
      6.      From a perusal of the order dated 22.06.2010, it is noticed that in
      paragraph-1 of the said order, it had been stated that the petitioner being the
      in-charge Secretary of the Nagaon Branch of the respondent ASCARD Bank
      had placed the aforesaid Hasen Ali and Gopal Bora on voluntary retirement
WP(C) No.4003 of 2010                                                            Page 2 of 6

      without obtaining the written consent from the said two employees. In the
      second paragraph of the said order, it is stated that the Board of Directors of
      the then Nagaon Branch of the respondent ASCARD Bank had resolved to give
      voluntary retirement to Md. Hasen Ali due to his heart ailment and Gopal Bora
      on the ground of sitting idle and suffering from cancer. The order also states
      that as the orders of voluntary retirement were interfered by this Court and
      the respondent ASCARD Bank had to pay the financial benefits to the
      concerned employees, the respondent ASCARD Bank was required to make a
      payment of Rs.4,83,969/- to Ms. Hasen Ali and Rs.3,99,350/- to the legal
      heirs of late Gopal Bora.
      7.      In the 9th paragraph of the said order, it is stated that all those
      happenings had taken place due to the negligence and lack of interest
      towards the bank by the writ petitioner and accordingly, the bank was made
      to suffer a financial loss. It is also stated that the letter dated 27.02.2008 was
      issued to the present petitioner stating that loss had been caused to the
      respondent ASCARD Bank due to his negligence and accordingly penal actions
      were taken u/s 8(2) of The Assam Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
      M anagem ent Act, 2005 (in short FR BM Act) . It was further stated that
      the reply of the petitioner to the letter dated 27.02.2008 under Section 8(2) of
      the FRBM Actwas not found satisfactory and he had failed to justify his action
      in the matter.
      8.      Accordingly, the respondent ASCARD Bank seeks to recover an amount
      of Rs.8,83,319/- from the writ petitioner, as contained in the order dated
      22.06.2010.
      9.      In the affidavit in opposition dated 20.01.2014 filed by the respondent
      Nos. 2, 3 and 4, in paragraph-7, it had been stated that the Board of Directors
      of the ASCARD bank had taken the decision in its meeting held on 05.05.2000
      to place the concerned employees in voluntary retirement. It is further stated
      that though the Board of Directors had taken the decision, it was the duty of
      the petitioner to observe the rules and procedures at the time of execution of
      any decision of the Board of Directors and that it was the bounden duty of the
      petitioner to obtain the applications for voluntary retirement from the
      employees concerned prior to issuance of the order of voluntary retirement.
WP(C) No.4003 of 2010                                                              Page 3 of 6

      10.     The said stand of the respondent bank appears to be self
      contradictory. On one hand the respondent bank stated that the Board of
      Directors of the ASCARD Bank had taken the decision to place the concerned
      employees on voluntary retirement in its meeting held on 05.05.2007 and
      again it is stated that it was the duty of the executing officer to follow the
      rules and procedures before executing the decision of the Board of Directors.
      The said stand of the Board of Directors cannot prima-facie be accepted. The
      decision to put the concerned employees under voluntary retirement is either
      a decision of the Board of Directors, in which case no further discretion is with
      the Secretary to invite application and decide the grant of voluntary
      retirement, or the entire decision to either grant or not to grant the voluntary
      retirement is left to the discretion of the concerned Secretary, in which case
      he is required to do the needful by following the rules and procedures. Both
      stands cannot simultaneously go together.
      11.     In such view of the matter, this Court is of the view that the impugned
      decision dated 22.06.2010 of the Executive Director of the respondent
      ASCARD Bank to recover an amount of Rs.8,83,319/-from the petitioner is not
      sustainable.
      12.     Further, the recovery of amount is stated to be a penal action that has
      been taken against the petitioner. In order to take a penal action, the
      respondent authorities are bound under the law to follow the required
      procedure. A mere letter dated 02.02.2008 indicating that the penal action
      was taken under Section 8(2) of the Assam Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
      Management Act, 2005 is not sufficient compliance of the required procedure
      to impose a penalty of recovery of an amount from an employee. In such
      view of the matter also, the order dated 22.06.2010 to recover the amount of
      Rs.8,83,319/- is hereby held to be unsustainable.
      13.     Further, Section 8(2) of the Assam Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
      Management Act, 2005, inter-alia, provides that whoever causes financial loss
      to the State Government, willfully and with a malafide intention in respect of
      assessment or realization of revenue due to the State Government or by
      incurring unauthorized expenditure, shall commit an offence, which would be
WP(C) No.4003 of 2010                                                           Page 4 of 6

      punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three
      years, and/or recovery of the amount of loss caused.
      14.     Section 8(4) of the         Assam Fiscal Responsibility      and   Budget
      Management Act, 2005 states that notwithstanding anything contained in the
      Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the offences committed under the Act shall
      be treated as cognizable offences. While Section 8(5) provides that offences
      under the Act shall be triable by a Magistrate not lower in rank than of a
      Judicial Magistrate of 1st class.
      15.     From the aforesaid provisions of Section 8 of the Assam Fiscal
      Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2005, it is clear that firstly, a
      financial loss is required to be caused to the State Government by an under-
      assessment or under-realization of revenue or by incurring unauthorized
      expenditure and secondly, such act would constitute an offence, which is
      triable by a Judicial Magistrate, 1st class. The provisions of Section 8(5) makes
      it apparently clear that even if any act on the part of a Government employee
      constitutes an offence u/s 8(2) of the Assam Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
      Management Act, 2005, the statutory remedy for the same would be a trial by
      the Judicial Magistrate, 1st class as per Section 8(5) of the Act.
      16.     The impugned decision dated 22.06.2010 of the Executive Director of
      the respondent ASCARD Bank, even if sought to be justified by relying upon
      Section 8(2) of the Assam Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act,
      2005, the same would still constitute a decision without any jurisdiction and
      authority inasmuch as, the Executive Director does not exercise the power of
      a Judicial Magistrate 1st Class.
      17.     In such view of the matter also, the decision dated 22.06.2010 of the
      Executive Director of the respondent ASCARD Bank to recover an amount of
      Rs.8,83,319/- from the petitioner is not sustainable.
      18.     Accordingly, the order dated 22.06.2010 is hereby set aside. Although
      the respondent bank in their affidavit in opposition had taken a stand that the
      writ petition is not maintainable inasmuch as the bank itself has not been
      arrayed as a respondent, but be that as it may as the concerned officers, who
      had passed the impugned order and also involved in the impugned decision
      have been arrayed as respondents in this proceeding, this Court deems it
WP(C) No.4003 of 2010                                                             Page 5 of 6

      appropriate that the aforesaid technical objection raised by the respondent
      authorities should not come in the way in deciding this writ petition on its own
      merit.
             In terms of the above, the writ petition stands disposed of.
                                                                            JUDGE
