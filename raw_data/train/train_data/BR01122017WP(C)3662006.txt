       Date of Hearing :22.11.2017                               Date of Judgment:01.12.2017
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biswanath Rath, J. This writ petition involves challenge to the order of the
       Commissioner, Consolidation & Settlement, Cuttack passed in R.C. No.395 of
       2004 thereby dismissing the claim of the petitioner involving an application
       under Section 37(1) of the O.C.H. & P.F.L. Act.
       2.     Short background involved in the case is that the land under dispute in
       the nature of homestead was recorded in the name of Mayadhar Mishra and
       others in Khata No.295, Plot No.916, Ac.0.130 decimals and the plot was
       claimed to be under possession of Hadibandhu Behera in Sikim Khata No.19
       in 1930 record of rights.             Hadibandhu Behera died prior to 1939 leaving
       behind his widow, namely, Nila and daughter                      Sukhi. Nila, out of Ac.0.130
       decimals alienated Ac.0.30 decimals in favour of Rasananda Behera, the

                                      2
father of the opposite party nos.2 and 3 by Registered Sale Deed No.4801
dated 17.11.1939 and balance Ac.0.100 decimals in favour of her daughter
Sukhi by Registered Sale Deed No.4802 dated 27.11.1939.Said Rasananda
Behera     sold Ac.0.015 decimals out of Ac.0.030 decimals of            land by
Registered Sale Deed No.5385 dated 27.11.1943 in favour of Sukhi Dei and,
thus, after the purchase Sukhi became the owner of Ac.0.115 decimals in
Plot No.916. It is further stated that Sukhi Dei was remaining as owner in
possession of Ac.0.115 decimals of land and the father of opposite party
nos.2 and 3 was the owner of Ac.0.015 decimals of land. Vide notification
dated 21.6.1961, Government of Orissa acquired Ac.0.010 decimals of land
from the ownership of Sukhi Dei for government purpose and Sukhi Dei has
also been paid with due compensation. Thus, at this stage, Sukhi Dei
continued to be the owner of Ac.0.105 decimals of land from which she
alienated Ac.0. Ac.0.095 decimals of land in favour of the petitioner by
Registered Sale Deed No.1300 dated 25.2.1963 with due delivery of
possession of the land in favour of the petitioner. After alienation of the land,
Ac.0.090 decimals of land in favour of the petitioner, Sakhi Dei remained
owner of Ac.0.015 decimals of land and it is at this point of time, opposite
party nos.2 and 3 purchased Ac.0.025 decimals of land from Sukhi Dei by
way of Registered Sale Deed No.6818 dated 3.12.1980 but without
considering the land remained in existence of the vendor of the petitioner so
also the vender of the opposite party nos.2 and 3. It is at this point of time,
consolidation operation started in the area where the Consolidation Authority

                                      3
recorded Ac.0.080 decimals of land as against the petitioner alleged to have
been lesser than the land sold to the petitioner by Registered Sale Deed
No.1300 dated      25.2.1963 and final record of rights are also published
accordingly as appearing in the year 1992.     Petitioner having come to know
the recording of lesser land involving the petitioner, petitioner preferred R.C.
No.395 of 2004 challenging the illegalities made in hal consolidation record
and thereby prayed for due correction in the consolidation record of right.
The revision was dismissed by final order vide Annexure-4 holding against
the petitioner.
3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner assailing the impugned order
contended that despite of a clear picture available, particularly, with regard to
Sukhi Dei alienating Ac.0.090 decimals of land in favour of the petitioner by
way of Registered Sale Deed dated 25.2.1963 and Registered Sale Deed in
favour of opposite party nos.2 and 3 of a higher extent of land and there
being a sale of higher extent of land in favour of opposite party nos.2 and 3
without entitlement of the vendor, the Revisional authority failed in
appreciating this aspect of the matter and thereby arrived at the wrong and
illegal impugned order. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that
unless the impugned order is interfered with the petitioner will suffer great
prejudice for no fault of him.
4.    To the contrary, Sri U.K. Mohanty, learned counsel appearing for the
opposite party nos.2 and 3 referring to the contentions of opposite party nos.2
and 3, as narrated in the counter affidavit, contended that the claim of sale in

                                         4
favour of the petitioner by Sukhi Dei to the extent of Ac.0.090 decimals of land
by virtue of Registered Sale Deed dated 25.2.1963 and giving delivery of its
possession to the petitioner of the while land are all false for non filing of the
sale deed by the petitioner nor filing of a certified copy thereof to establish his
case in the writ petition. Learned counsel for the opposite party nos. 2 and 3
claimed that the petitioner has no sustainable claim.         The opposite party
nos.2 and 3 also alleged involvement of malafide intention and stage
managed sale deed obtained fraudulently in the guise of a will, which also
was the bone of contention at the instance of Sukhi Bewa in T.S.No.69 of
1981. But unfortunately, the suit was dismissed for default on account of
death of Sukhi Bewa.          Referring to the plaint narrations, the counsel
appearing for the opposite party nos.2 and 3 attempted to justify the claim on
behalf of the opposite party nos.2 and 3. Denying the allegation in the writ
petition, learned counsel appearing for the opposite party nos.2 and 3 prayed
for dismissal of the writ petition.
5.     Sri  Birkam    Senapati,     learned   Additional  government     Advocate
supporting the stand of opposite party nos.2 and 3 and taking this Court to
the observations of the learned           authority below vide impugned order
submitted that there is no infirmity in the impugned order.
6.           Considering the rival contentions of the parties, this Court finds
there is no dispute that even after acquisition of land by the State
Government belonging to Sukhi Dei, Sukhi Dei still remains owner of
Ac.0.105 decimals of land. There also appears a sale deed in favour of the

                                      5
petitioner establishing the sale of Ac.0.090 decimals of land in favour of the
petitioner by virtue of a sale deed dated 25.2.1963. There is also no denial to
the fact that at the same time there also exists a sale deed dated 3.11.1980 in
favour of opposite party nos.2 and 3 establishing sale of Ac.0.025 decimals of
land to the father of the opposite party nos.2 and 3. Thus, here the question
remains to be decided until and unless the sale deed standing in favour of the
petitioner is not nullified by any court of law in spite of the vendor of the
opposite party nos.2 and 3 had a sale deed with the opposite party nos.2 and
3 to the extent of Ac.0.025 decimals of land, no right of opposite party nos.2
and 3 can accrue in respect of Ac.0.025 decimals as their vendor did not have
such land with her as on the date of that sale deed. Taking into consideration
of the facts involving sale transaction between the petitioner and opposite
party nos.1 and 2 and on perusal of the discussions on the case of the parties
involving impugned order at Annexure-4, this Court finds the authority below
has taken into account the above facts in deciding the claim of the petitioner.
When the authority below taking into consideration the rival contentions
parties and materials available in their support, came to observe that in 1930
settlement Plot No.916, Ac.0.13 decimals under Malik Khata No.295 was
recorded n favour of Mayadhar Mishra, Jagnyeswar Mishra and Trilochan
Mishra     as stitiban status with note of sikim possession of Hadibandhu
Mishra.     After the death of Hadibandhu Mishra, his wife Nila Bewa alienated
the sikim right for an area of Ac.0.03 decimals of land out of Sabik Plot
No.916, Ac.0.13 decimals out of Sabik Plot No.916, Ac.0.13 decimals to

                                        6
Rasananda Behera, the deceased father of the opposite party nos.2 and 3.
Similarly, on the same day, Nila Bewa alienated her sikim right over rest of
the area Ac.0.10 decimals out of Sabik Plot No.916, Ac.0.13 decimals to her
own daughter Sakhi Dei through Registered Sale Deed dated 17.11.1939
where after Rasananda Behera further alienated Ac.0.015 decimals out of his
purchased sikim area Ac.0.030 decimals of land to Sakhi Dei. Thus, Sakhi
Dei became the owner of total land Ac.0.115 decimals. Accepting the claim
of opposite party nos.2 and 3 that Sakhi Dei alienated Ac.0.025 decimals to
Rasananda Behera through Registered Sale Deed dated 3.12.1980,
petitioner became the sikim right purchaser of Ac.0.09 decimals. Records
further also revealed that from the purchased land of the petitioner adjoins to
the canal of the Irrigation Department. The Irrigation Department acquired
Ac.0.010 decimals of land for canal purpose. So the petitioner remained with
balance Ac.0.080 decimals of land as against his purchased sikim area
Ac.0.090 decimals of land. It is fur the detailed discussions and the above
observations of the lower authority and taking into consideration the claim of
the petitioner that the petitioner had purchased all total Ac.0.090 decimals of
land and for fact revelation that Irrigation Department has acquired land from
the portion of the petitioner’s land, this Court finds there no illegality in the
sale of Sakhi Dei to an extent of Ac.0.025 decimals in favour of opposite party
nos.2 and 3.
7.    As a result, this Court finds there remains no wrong recording in the
settlement record of right so far as the petitioner is concerned. For the above,

                                        7
this Court finds there is no infirmity in the impugned order leaving any scope
for this Court to interfere in the same.
8.    The writ petition thus failed. However, there is no order as to cost.
