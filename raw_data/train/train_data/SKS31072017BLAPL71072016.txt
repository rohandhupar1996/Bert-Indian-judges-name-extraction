       P R E S E N T:
                    THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S.K. SAHOO
       ………………………………………………………………………………………
       Date of Argument: 20.07.2017                    Date of order: 31.07.2017
       ………………………………………………………………………………………
S.K.SAHOO, J.       The petitioner Surendranath Mishra in BLAPL NO.
       7106 Of 2016 is the father of the petitioner Trilochana Mishra in

                                 2
BLAPL No. 7107 Of 2016. The petitioners earlier approached this
Court for bail in BLAPL No. 7367 of 2015 and BLAPL NO. 7060 of
2015 respectively which were heard analogously and dismissed
by a common order dated 25.05.2016. The petitioners moved
the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the said order for bail vide
S.L.P. (Crl.) Nos. 4540 of 2016 and 4541 of 2016 which were
also dismissed vide order dated 20.06.2016 giving liberty to the
petitioners to apply for bail at a later stage after completion of
investigation with further observation that the same shall be
considered without being influenced by the observations made in
the impugned order.
2.          There is no dispute that the First Information Report
was lodged in this case by one Mochiram Sahoo on 03.09.2015
before Inspector in Charge, Chatrapur Police Station, on the
basis of which Chatrapur P.S. Case No.119 of 2015 dated
03.09.2015 was registered under sections 420, 423, 467, 468,
471, 506, 120-B read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code
and the Inspector in charge himself took up investigation of the
case. The Crime Branch assumed full control over investigation
of the case as per the CID CB Office Order No.152/CID dated
04.09.2015 and the case was re-registered as CID, CB, Odisha,
Cuttack P.S. Case No.28 of 2015 on dated 04.09.2015 for

                                  3
offences punishable under sections 420, 423, 467, 468, 471,
506, 120-B read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and
the petitioners were taken on remand in this case on 24.09.2015
and charge sheet was submitted on 20.01.2016 against the
petitioners under sections 420, 423, 467, 468, 471, 406, 506,
120-B    read   with   34  of   Indian  Penal   Code   and   further
investigation was kept open under section 173(8) of Cr.P.C. for
arrest of the absconding accused and to ascertain complicity of
other persons, if any, collection of other evidence and to recover
more proceeds of crime.
3.           The bail applications of the petitioners were earlier
rejected by this Court, inter alia, on the ground that there were
prima    facie  materials   regarding   the   involvement   of   the
petitioners in the commission of crime and also considering the
nature and gravity of the accusation, the criminal proclivity of
the   petitioners,   chance   of  tampering    with  the   evidence
particularly when the investigation was under progress and many
important facets of the case were to be unearthed.
             In the meantime, after completion of investigation,
final chargesheet was submitted against the petitioners under
sections 420, 423, 467, 468, 471, 406, 506, 120-B read with 34
of Indian Penal Code on 30.12.2016.

                                   4
4.           As per the final chargesheet, the petitioners hatched
out a criminal conspiracy to cheat the informant Mochiram Sahu
to garb his valuable land and accordingly, they managed to
record it in the name of the Trust by preparing forged sale deed
on 12.04.2013. The petitioners managed to prepare the deed as
a sale deed in place of a gift deed falsely mentioning payment of
Rs.26,84,570/-      to  the   informant  (seller)  as  consideration
amount. Thus the petitioners prepared a false registered deed
and mutated the said land using the false document as genuine.
The Trust did not contribute anything towards the purchase or
acquisition of land for branch Ashram and the disciples of
Chatrapur and Berhampur area also did not arrange fund for the
land. It is falsely mentioned in the deed that consideration
amount of Rs.26,84,570/- has been paid to Mochiram Sahu
earlier in the village in presence of deed witnesses, i.e., Binayak
Sahu (the son of the informant) and G. Jawaharlal. On
examination,     these    witnesses  stated   that  they  have    no
knowledge about payment of the consideration amount. The
petitioners made Sri Binayak Sahu (son of the informant
Mochiram Sahu) as a witness in the deed knowing full well that
Binayak Sahu was mentally unsound and unfit to stand as a
witness. It is further mentioned in the final chargesheet that the

                                5
petitioners misappropriated Rs.33,05,997/- of Shree Shree Shree
Mahapurusha Achyutananda Trust by making false declaration in
income tax returns of the year 2013-14 that it was the
contribution of the Trust for purchase of land at branches. The
bank statements of the informant Mochiram Sahu do not show
the deposit of consideration money. The bank accounts of the
Trust or the petitioners do not disclose withdrawal of such
amount for payment of consideration amount to the informant,
as falsely claimed by the petitioners. It is further mentioned in
the final chargesheet that from the statements of witnesses and
medical reports and prescriptions, it is evident that Binayak
Sahu, the son of the informant Mochiram Sahu was mentally
infirm and has not recovered contrary to the promise/assurance
made    by   petitioner Surendranath    Mishra.   The   petitioners
fraudulently collected huge money and valuables from thousands
of people by cheating by using so-called palm leaf POTHI of
Mahapurusha       Achyutananda.    During    investigation,    cash
amounting to Rs.29,93,910/-, gold ornaments weighing 533.240
grams and silver ornaments weighing 1984.98 grams were
seized from the possession of the petitioners along with palm
leaf POTHI used for cheating. It is further mentioned in the final
chargesheet that total amount of Rs.2,78,71,473/- was found

                                  6
deposited in different banks in 92 accounts in respect of the
Trust    and   petitioner  Surendranath   Mishra  and   his   family
members. An amount of Rs.21,54,516/- was found deposited in
36 policies and three fixed deposits in LIC., Rs.35,28,300/- was
found     deposited    in   H.D.F.C.   Standard  Life    Insurance,
Rs.1,97,000/- in H.D.F.C. Mutual Fund and Rs.1,14,000/- in Birla
Sun Life Mutual Fund. It is further mentioned in the final
chargesheet that around 88 acres of land at different places were
recorded in the names of Trust, the petitioners and their family
members and there was reason to believe that those properties
were the proceeds of crime. It is further mentioned in the final
chargesheet that the petitioner Surendranath Mishra was the
founder     Trustee     of  Shree    Shree   Shree    Mahapurusha
Achyutananda Trust and the petitioner Trilochan Mishra was
holding the office of Chairman-cum-Managing Trustee and all the
activities of Trahi Achyuta Ashram and of Trust were managed by
the petitioners. Trahi Achyuta Ashram was evaluated by a team
of Assistant Engineer of R & B Department and the value of built
up structure of the Ashram is Rs.20,44,43,000/-.       It is further
mentioned in the final chargesheet that the petitioners had no
source of income and could not account for those movable and
immovable properties and there was reason to believe that most

                                 7
of those properties were acquired illegally by cheating the public
including the informant of the case with an intention to
misappropriate for personal gains. It is further mentioned in the
chargesheet that the Joint Director, Enforcement Directorate,
Bhubaneswar registered a case under section 3 of the Prevention
of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against the petitioners and
others   and    prima    facie  evidence   under   sections  120-
B/420/423/467/468/471/406/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code
was found against the petitioners.
5.          Mr.    Asok    Mohanty,   learned   Senior   Advocate
appearing for the petitioners contended that the offences are
triable by Magistrate and final chargesheet has been submitted
and there is no chance of absconding of the petitioners who are
in custody in connection with this case since 24.09.2015 and
therefore, the bail application may be favourably considered.
            Mr. Janmejaya Katikia, learned Addl. Government
Advocate on the other hand contended that the petitioner
Surendranath Mishra challenged the entire criminal proceeding in
G.R. Case No.258 of 2015 pending in the Court of learned
S.D.J.M., Chatrapur before this Court in CRLMC No.2344 of 2016
which was dismissed vide order dated 18.01.2017. He further
submitted that the petitioners filed CRLMC No.1272 of 2016 and

                                 8
1271 of 2016 along with others challenging the order passed by
the learned S.D.J.M., Chatrapur in G.R. Case No.258 of 2015 for
release of their different bank and postal accounts, which were
frozen by the C.I.D. C.B., Cuttack which were also dismissed
vide judgment and order dated 19.05.2017. It is further
contended that the petitioner Surendranath Mishra is a very
influential person who may bias and intimidate witnesses and
tamper with the evidence, if released on bail and in fact the
petitioners have started tampering with the evidence of the
informant    even  remaining   inside jail custody.  He  further
submitted that there are number of cases pending against the
petitioners i.e., Balipatna P.S. Case No.187 dated 30.08.2015
under sections 341/341/323/294/506/34 of I.P.C. read with
section 3(1)(x) of SC & ST (PA) Act, Balipatna P.S. Case No.189
dated 31.08.2015 under sections 294/506/120-B/420/509/34 of
I.P.C., Balipatna P.S. Case No.190 dated 31.08.2015 under
sections 341/342/294/506/34 of I.P.C., Balipatna P.S. Case
No.191 dated 31.08.2015 under section 25 of Arms Act and 34
of I.P.C., Balipatna P.S. Case No.196 dated 01.09.2015 under
sections 365/506/34 of I.P.C., Chatrapur P.S. CaseNo.119 dated
03.09.2015 under sections 420/423/467/468/471/506/120-B/34
of I.P.C., Balipatna P.S. Case No.219 dated 01.10.2015 under

                                   9
sections 342/347/323/466/467/468/294/506/420/34 of I.P.C.
read with section 25 and 27 of Arms Act and therefore, in view of
the criminal proclivity of the petitioners and absence of any
change    in   the   circumstances    except  submission   of   final
chargesheet, there is nothing to reconsider the successive bail
applications    of  the   petitioners  and   accordingly, the    bail
applications should be rejected.
6.           Bentham said, "Witnesses are the eyes and ears of
justice". When the witnesses are not able to depose in the Court
of law freely and correctly due to threat/intimidation/inducement
by various means by use of muscle and money power by the
accused, it shakes public confidence in the criminal justice
delivery system. Therefore, at the time of grant of bail, apart
from considering the nature and gravity of the accusation, it is
also to be seen whether the accused would be readily available
for his trial and whether he is likely to abuse the discretion
granted in his favour by tampering with the evidence.
             During hearing of these bail applications, an affidavit
was filed on behalf of the petitioners by one Biranchi Narayan
Mishra, another son of petitioner Surendranath Mishra             on
07.03.2017 and in the said affidavit, it is mentioned as follows:-
             “2. That during the pendency of the aforesaid
             bail applications, the informant Mochiram Sahu

                                 10
            has amicably settled the matter for which he has
            filed an application under section 320 of Cr.P.C.
            before the learned Court of S.D.J.M., Chatrapur
            in G.R. Case No.258 of 2015 arising out of
            Chatrapur P.S. Case No.119 of 2015 converted
            to C.D.C.I.B. P.S. Case No.28 of 2015 under
            sections 420/423/467/468/471/506/120-B and
            34 of IPC. A copy of the petition u/s. 320 of
            Cr.P.C. is annexed herewith and marked as
            Annexure-7.
            3. That, the informant has filed an application
            before   the   learned  Civil Judge   (Sr.   Div.),
            Chatrapur in C.S. No.15 of 2016 praying for
            production of Defendant No.1 i.e., Trilochan
            Mishra to sign and execute the compromise
            petition as the Jail Authority of Special Jail,
            Jharpada,      Bhubaneswar      where      present
            petitioners are residing, are not cooperating to
            either execute special power of attorney or not
            allowing the petitioners to sign the compromise
            petition. A copy of the application filed by the
            informant before the Court of Civil Judge (Sr.
            Div.),  Chatrapur    is annexed    herewith    and
            marked as Annexure-8.”
            The copy of the affidavit was served on the learned
counsel for State and when the matter was taken up for orders
on 12.05.2017, the learned counsel for the petitioners relied

                                 11
upon the affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners. When the
learned counsel for the State was asked about the compromise
between the parties, he submitted that he had not obtained any
instruction in that respect. This Court on the prayer of the
learned counsel for the petitioners permitted to implead the
informant as opposite party no.2 and issued notice to him. The
matter was again taken up on 30.06.2017 for orders and the
informant Mochiram Sahu was present in Court on that day. The
Investigating Officer was also present. When the compromise
petition filed before the learned S.D.J.M., Chatrapur in G.R. Case
No.258 of 2015 as well as petition filed by the plaintiff
(informant) before the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Chatrapur in
C.S. No.15 of 2016 which were annexed to the affidavit filed on
behalf of the petitioners were confronted to the informant, he
made pre-varicating statements relating to the contents of such
documents and accordingly, on the prayer of the learned counsel
for the State, the learned S.D.J.M., Chatrapur was directed to
record the 164 Cr.P.C. statement of the informant to ascertain
the genuineness and truthfulness of the contents of the
compromise petition filed before his Court as well as the petition
which was filed before the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division),
Chatrapur in Civil Suit No.15 of 2016. The Investigating Officer

                                12
was directed to produce the 164 Cr.P.C. statement of the
informant on the next date. Subsequently the learned counsel for
the State produced the certified copy of the 164 Cr.P.C.
statement of the informant. On perusal of such statement, it is
found that the same was recorded by the learned S.D.J.M.,
Chatrapur on 04.07.2017 in which the informant has stated that
in order to return his lands, Dharani Jena, Subhakanta Jena,
Biranchi Mishra and Rajendra Sahu who are the active members
of Trahi Achyuta Ashram took his signatures and submitted the
same in the Court. He further stated that subsequently he came
to know that they have adopted fraudulent means and misguided
him by way of filing a compromise petition in order to obtain bail
order for Sura Baba and the other accused. He further stated
that even though the signatures appearing in the documents
belonged to him but he was not aware about the contents of the
documents and that by cheating him, the compromise petition
has been filed without his knowledge. He further stated that he
was also unaware about the contents of the compromise petition
which was filed before the learned Civil Judge (Sr. Div.),
Chatrapur in C.S. No.15 of 2016 and without his knowledge,
such petition has been filed. He further stated that there was no

                                 13
compromise between him and the accused persons and there
was no amicable settlement and he wants to prosecute the case.
7.           Adverting to the contentions raised by the learned
counsels   for  the   respective  parties   and  the  lis  pendens
development and from the entire episode narrated above, it is
crystal clear that even though the petitioners are inside jail
custody, attempts are being made by their henchmen to tamper
with the evidence, fabricating documents and filing false affidavit
in Court to pave way for the bail of the petitioners. The
reasonable apprehension of the prosecution that the entire
episode has been stage managed at the instance of petitioner
Surendranath     Mishra  cannot be    ruled   out. The    petitioner
Surendranath Mishra has thousands of followers as per the
prosecution report and when remaining inside jail custody,
attempts are being made by the petitioners to throttle the neck
of justice by adopting unfair method, granting of bail to the
petitioners in such circumstances would be just like giving death
knell to the prosecution case. It cannot be lost sight of the fact
that the petitioners have criminal proclivity and they have played
with the religious feelings and sentiments of innocent persons in
the name of bringing divine blessings for them. Therefore,
without being influenced by the observations made in the earlier

                                     14
rejection order but on going through the materials on record as
per final charge sheet as well as the conduct of the petitioners in
tampering with the evidence, I am of the humble view that in
order to have a free and fair trial of the case and to uphold the
majesty of the law, grant of bail to the petitioners would not be
conducive in the interests of justice.
                  Accordingly,   the bail applications   filed by  the
petitioners Surendranath Mishra and Trilochan Mishra sans merit
and hence stand rejected.
                  Urgent certified copy of this order be granted on
proper application.
                                                    ...…………………………
