      KURIAN, J.
                           Leave granted.
                       2.  In the nature of order we propose to pass, it is
                       not  necessary    to  issue  notice   to  the  respondents
                       since   the   interest    of   the   respondents    is  not
                       otherwise affected.
                       3.  The appellant has been non-suited by the High
                       Court on the ground that the second writ petition
                       filed is not maintainable, having withdrawn earlier
                       writ petition without any leave.
                       4.  The order dated 28.07.2016 passed in the earlier
                       Writ Petition No.2748/2016 reads as follows:-
                                 “Shri V.A. Dhabe, the learned counsel
                           for   the   petitioner    seeks   permission   to
Signature Not Verified
                           withdraw the Writ Petition.

                                 Permission    is   granted.      The   Writ
Reason:
                           Petition stands disposed of as withdrawn.”
                                                      1

5.   It   is   fairly    clear     that    the   petition   was
withdrawn    only  on  account     of   the  pendency   of  the
appeal.    Apparently, that is why the High Court has,
in  fact,   not   dismissed    the    petition;   it  has  only
disposed it of.
6.   In  the    second   writ    petition     leading   to  the
impugned judgment, there is a specific prayer, which
reads as follows:-
     “(iii)      quash     and      set     aside     the
     communication dated 3.9.2016 at Annexure-10
     issued by respondent No.5 being           violative
     of principles of natural justice and bad in
     law;”
7.   It  appears     that   the     prayer   challenging    the
subsequent order passed in appeal was not brought to
the notice of the High Court.
8.   In that view of the matter, the writ petition
certainly is maintainable.        Accordingly, we set aside
the  impugned    judgment   with     a  request   to  the  High
Court   to    consider    Writ    Petition     No.484/2017   on
merits.
9.   We make it clear that we have not considered the
merits of the matter.
10. The appellant is also directed to serve a copy of
this    judgment     along     with      a   copy    of    this
petition/appeal to the respondents.
11. The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
                                 2

 12. Pending   applications,    if  any,   shall   stand
 disposed of.
 13. There shall be no orders as to costs.
