        PROF RAM BUX JAT                                    ..... Petitioner
                            Through:    Mr. Piyush Sharma, Advocate

                                                             ..... Respondent
                            Through: Mr. Aly Mirza, Advocate
        CORAM:
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR
                           ORDER
                            (ORAL)
1.      This is second round of litigation. In the first round of litigation,
vide order of 7th May, 2015 (Annexure P-24), petitioner was permitted to
pursue remedy with respondent-University. According to petitioner, a
Representation of 29th June, 2015 (Annexure P-27) seeking dearness
allowance on pension payable to him since the year 2008, was made to
respondent-University.
2.      Learned counsel for petitioner submits that despite reminder of 18 th
August, 2016 (Annexure P-30) and another reminder of 28th December,
2016 (Annexure P-32), petitioner’s Representation of 29th June, 2015
(Annexure P-27) has not been decided by respondent-University till date.
It is pointed out by petitioner’s counsel that a Representation of 10 th June,
2016 (Annexure P-29) was also made to Ministry of Human Resource
and Development (HRD) which was forwarded to the said Ministry.
3.      So far as petitioner’s claim for grant of 57 days’ half pay leave
encashment and travel grant/ composite transfer grant and travel
W.P.(C) 1302/2018                                                    Page 1 of 2

allowance on retirement is concerned, it is a stale claim, as petitioner had
admittedly retired in the year 2008 and had raised this claim by way of
Representation purportedly made in the year 2016-17, which is not on
record. So, this stale claim is declined for the reason that after a decade
or so, respondent may not be having relevant record in respect of this
belated claim.
4.      In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is deemed
appropriate to direct respondent-University to expedite obtaining of
clarification from Ministry of HRD regarding payment of dearness
allowance on pension and to decide petitioner’s Representation of 29th
June, 2015 (Annexure P-27) within a period of twelve weeks by passing a
speaking order and its fate be conveyed to petitioner within two weeks
thereafter, so that petitioner may avail of the remedy, as available in law,
if need be.
5.     With aforesaid directions, this petition is disposed of.
                                                            (SUNIL GAUR)
