                    JUDGMENT & ORDER (Oral)
       Heard Ms. S. Senapati, learned counsel, appearing for the
appellant/ defendant. None appears for the respondents/ plaintiffs.
2]           The judgment and decree impugned in this second appeal
is dated 13.12.2012, passed in T.S. No. 6/2007, by the court of the

                                     2
learned District Judge, Nalbari. The appellant/ defendant before this
court is the defendant No. 2 in T.S. No. 6 of 2003 in the court of the
learned Civil Judge, Nalbari. The respondents, as the plaintiffs, filed the
said suit for declaration of the right, title, interest, possession, partition
and injunction of the suit land. The land measuring 10 Bighas, 3
Kathas and 3 Lechas described in schedule “kha” of the plaint out of 24
Bighas 17 Lechas as described in schedule “ka” was purchased by late
Maheswar Barman, the father of the plaintiffs/ respondents by way of
sale deed dated 19.1.1965 from one Tarini Barman, the vendor and
the possession was delivered and accepted. The defendant No. 1
Ramesh Barman is the nephew of Maheswar Barman and the said
defendant No.1 was an employee of Maheswar Barman, who was a
shop keeper. The said Maheswar Barman entrusted the said defendant
No. 1 to look after his works and taking the advantage of it, the
defendant No. 1 mutated his name in the Chita in respect of the
disputed land.
3]             The said Maheswar Barman came to know about the said
mutation of the defendant No. 1. He filed Mutation Case No. 38/1989
and the defendant No. 1 on 4.9.1989 executed a document stating that
his name was wrongly mutated and he has no objection in the event of
mutation of the name of Maheswar Barman is allowed and corrected.

                                     3
Thereafter, Maheswar Barman died on 16.6.1999 and the plaintiffs/
respondents pleaded that after the death of their father they enquired
about the said mutation case, but could not trace out the record of the
Mutation Case No. 38/1989. They filed another mutation case being
Mutation Case No. 4/1999 and the same was allowed in favour of the
plaintiffs/ respondents and their names were allowed to be corrected in
the Jama Bandi. The said defendant No.1 preferred an appeal which
was registered as R.A. No. 6/1999-2000 and in that appeal, the
defendant No.1 disclosed that he sold the disputed land to the
defendant No. 2, the present appellant on 8.9.1999 by a registered
sale deed No. 897/1999.
4]             After hearing the said appeal, the same was allowed in
favour of the defendant No.1 whereafter the plaintiffs/ respondents
filed the present suit for declaration of their right, title, interest and
confirmation of possession etc. and for cancellation of the sale deed
No. 897/1999. The defendant No.1 alongwith the defendant No. 2 i.e.
the present appellant filed their joint written statement wherein it was
pleaded that the defendant No.1 was engaged by late Maheswar
Barman for house hold works without any remuneration and as such
the said land was purchased in the name of defendant No.1 by
Maheswar Barman. Thereafter his name was mutated in respect of the

                                     4
said land. If any sale deed was executed with respect to the suit land
in favour of the Maheswar Barman, it was pleaded in the written
statement that the same was fraudulent one. The defendant No. 1
after the mutation had all along in possession of the suit land for about
28 years for which the title of Maheswar Barman extinguished over the
suit land and prayed for dismissal of the suit land.
5]             On the basis of the pleadings, following issues were
        framed:
               (1)   Whether there is any cause of action for the
                     present suit?
               (2)    Whether the suit is barred by limitation?
               (3)   Whether the plaintiff has right, title and interest
                     over the land, which is described in the “Kha”
                     schedule of the plaint?
               (4)   Whether the sale deed No. 897/1999 dated
                     8.9.1999 is liable to be cancelled?
               (5)   Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the decree of
                     partition?
               (6)   Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the decree as
                     prayed for?
               (7)   To what other relief/ relieves the parties are
                     entitled?
6]             Evidences were led by both the parties and thereafter the
trial court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiffs/ respondents.

                                    5
7]            Being aggrieved, the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 preferred
Title Appeal No. 6/2007 which was finally dismissed vide judgment and
decree dated 13.12.2013 by the first appellate court.
8]            This second appeal was thereafter filed against the said
judgment and decree dated 13.12.2012 passed in T.A. No. 6/2007,
which is taken up for admission under Order 41 Rule 11 CPC.
9]            Ms. Senapati, learned counsel, appearing on behalf of the
appellant/ defendant submits that the courts below failed to give
appropriate finding while discussing the issue No.2 that whether the
suit is barred by law of limitation. It is submitted that the name of
Ramesh Barman, the defendant No. 1 was very much on record since
1983. Further it was also in the knowledge of the plaintiffs/
respondents that the defendant No. 1 had sold the suit land by way of
registered sale deed No. 897/1999 dated 8.9.1999 to the present
defendant/ appellant. In such a situation, the suit ought to have been
filed within the period of three years as provided under Article 59 of
the Limitation Act, 1963.
10]           Considered the submission of the learned counsel. Under
Article 59 of the Limitation Act, 1963 it prescribes that to cancel or set

                                      6
aside an instrument, the period is 3 years when the facts entitling the
plaintiffs/ respondents to have the instrument cancelled first became
known to him.
11]            It is the pleadings of the plaintiffs/ respondents that they
have sought for the relief of declaration of their right, title alongwith
the cancellation of the registered sale deed No. 897/1999 dated
8.9.1999 as their names which were mutated were ordered to be
cancelled in RA No. 6/1999-2000 vide order dated 26.9.2002. It is also
pleaded that after the death of their father, Maheswar Barman, the
names of all the plaintiffs/ respondents were mutated vide order dated
9.11.1999, passed by the concerned Circle Officer. Subsequent thereto
only the said Revenue appeal was preferred by the defendant No. 1,
Ramesh Barman wherein it was stated that he had sold the land way
back in 1999 by way of registered sale deed to the present defendant
appellant. On the basis of the said prayer of the defendant No.1, the
Revenue Authority cancelled the mutation of the plaintiffs/ respondents
vide order dated 26.9.2002 and thereafter they have preferred the suit
for declaration of right, title and interest along with the consequential
reliefs including the cancellation of the sale deed bearing No.
897/1999, Ext. “ka”.

                                     7
12]             It is on record that during the life time of Maheswar
Barman, the defendant No. 1, Ramesh Barman by way of a written up
document submitted before the Circle Officer stated that his name was
wrongly mutated in place of Maheswar Barman. On the basis of the
said document, a correction was made on record by the Revenue
Authority which indicates that the name of Maheswar Barman was
recorded and thereafter the names of the plaintiffs/ respondents were
accordingly mutated on the basis of their application. The suit land was
in the possession of the plaintiffs/ respondents and they were under
the bona fide impression that the suit land was under the joint title of
the plaintiffs/ respondents. The subsequent appeal and its order
cancelling their names as pleaded by them gave rise to the cause of
action for filing the suit which they have done within one year from the
date of cancellation of their names. Under such circumstances, the
submission of Ms. Senapati cannot be accepted. It is only on the
cancellation of the mutation of the names of the plaintiffs/ respondents
the cause of action accrued to them to come up with the title suit.
13]             Ms. Senapati submits that the present defendant/
appellant is a bona fide purchaser. The said submission though not in
the pleadings, however, this court keeping in view of Section 55 (1)(a)
of the T.P. Act holds that the act of defendant No.1, Romesh Barman is

                                    8
itself a fraudulent act as stipulated under Section 55 of the T.P. Act.
The said defendant No. 1 was very much aware that by way of said
written up document, he informed the revenue authority that the name
of Maheswar Barman ought to be recorded instead of his name and to
that effect by way of the said document he informed that he has no
objection in the event of the correction made by mutating the name of
Maheswar Barman in place of him. The said document is Ext. 8 in the
case record as apparent from the judgment and decree passed in the
court. Hence, this court finds no substantial question of law in the
instant appeal and accordingly the same is dismissed.
14]           The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No order as to the
costs.
