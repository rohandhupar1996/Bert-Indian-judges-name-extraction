WP(C) No.1834/2008                                                       Page 1 of 5

                        JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
            Heard Mr. R. De, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard Mr. P.J.
Saikia, learned counsel, appearing for the respondent Nos.1 to 4 and Mr. S. Tai,
learned State counsel, appearing for the respondent No.5.
2.          The petitioner was appointed as Project Scientist in the Bio-Research
Centre at Madan Kamdev under the Environment Division of the Assam Science
Technology & Environment Council (AST&EC) at a consolidated pay of Rs.2,000/-
(Rupees Two Thousand) by an order dated 22.12.1994 issued by the Director of
AST&EC. Subsequently, an advertisement dated 28.02.1995 was issued inviting
applications in respect of some temporary posts including 1(one) post of Junior
Scientific Officer in the Assam Bio-Research Centre. The job description as indicated
in the advertisement indicated that incumbent would have to work at Madan Kamdev
site of the Bio-Research Centre of AST&EC and any other such centres/Sub-Centres.
Pursuant to the selection made by the Selection Committee, the petitioner was
appointed temporarily as Junior Scientific Officer in the Assam Bio-Research Centre
at Madan Kamdev by an order dated 30.01.1996. Subsequently, by an office order
dated 12.07.2000, because of heavy pressure of work, the petitioner was also
directed to work in the Environment Division for 3(three) days in a week in addition
to his own duty.
3.          On 22.01.2003, an office order was passed regularizing the services of the
petitioner as Junior Scientific Officer under Environment Division of the AST&EC
w.e.f. 07.12.2002. The order reads as under:-
                                           “OFFICE ORDER
                     As per the decision of the 8th Governing Body meeting held on 7th
            December, 02, Dr. Chandra Baruah who was appointed under ABRC project
            on temporary basis earlier is hereby regularised subject to discharge without
            notice and assigning any reason thereof as Jr. Scientific Officer under
            Environment Division of the ASTE Council in the Scale of pay of Rs.4390-90-
            4480 - 120 - 5200 - 175 - 6075 - EB - 175 - 6600 - 250 - 8100 - 325 - 11025
WP(C) No.1834/2008                                                           Page 2 of 5

            - 400 - 11425/- p.m. and other allowances as admissible under rules with
            effect from the date of approval of the 8th Governing Body.
                     The appointment is subject to police verification of character and
            antecedents.”
4.          Against the aforesaid order of regularization, the petitioner had submitted
a representation to the Director, AST&EC, which was forwarded to the Government
of Assam in the Science & Technology Department. However, the representation
was not favourably considered.
5.          By filing this application, the petitioner prays for extension of service
benefits from 01.02.1996, i.e. from the date of his initial appointment.
6.          Mr. De submits that the petitioner was appointed under AST&EC as a
Junior Scientific Officer pursuant to a selection process and, therefore, there can be
no justification for regularizing the service of the petitioner only w.e.f. 07.12.2002
and not from the date of his initial appointment and, therefore, it is a fit case for
issuing a direction to the respondents to consider the case of the petitioner for
regularization of his service and consequently to grant all benefits w.e.f. 01.02.1996.
7.          Mr. Saikia has submitted that the issue raised in the writ petition is
covered by judgment & order dated 17.09.2009 passed in WP(C) No.3604/2007
(Sandeep Bhattacharjee -Vs- AST&EC & Ors.) and other connected cases,
whereby similar plea raised by the petitioners therein for regularization of their
service from the date of their initial appointment, was rejected.
8.          The petitioners in the aforesaid writ petitions, engaged in different
Projects under AST&EC, were also regularized w.e.f. 07.12.2002 along with the
present petitioner and their prayer for retrospective regularization from the date of
joining was negated by this Court holding that no such posts existed in AST&EC.
9.          Placing reliance on the affidavit filed, it is submitted by Mr. Saikia that
that Assam Bio-Resarch Centre is a Project under the Environment Division of the
AST&EC and the pay and allowances of the employees appointed under the Project
are paid from the fund of the Project. It is submitted by him that the petitioner was
WP(C) No.1834/2008                                                          Page 3 of 5

appointed in a temporary post under the sponsored Project located at Madan
Kamdev. The temporary post of Junior Scientific Officer was a post in Assam Bio-
Research Centre and not under AST&EC. It is further submitted by him that the
sanctioned post of Junior Scientific Officer in the Environment Division of AST&EC
having been created pursuant to a policy decision of the AST&EC to regularize the
service of the employees engaged in different Projects, on 07.12.2002 in the 8th
Governing Body’s meeting of the AST&EC, the service of the petitioner was
regularized on and from that day in AST&EC as Junior Scientific Officer.
10.        This Court in Paragraphs-12 and 13 of Sandeep Bhattacharjee (supra),
has held as follows:-
           “12.        Upon perusal of the pleadings of the parties and also on
           consideration of the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for
           the parties, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners in WP(C)
           Nos.3604, 3605, 3606, 3607 of 2007 did not hold any sanctioned/regular
           posts prior to 7.12.2002 and, similarly, no posts were in existence prior to
           1.9.2005 in respect of petitioners in WP(C) Nos.3608/2007 and 3624/2007.
           The above position is not disputed by the learned counsel appearing for the
           petitioners, rather, the same is admitted as discussed above. Thus, the
           period of service rendered by the petitioners in work charged capacity prior
           to regularisation, can neither be regularised retrospectively nor can the same
           be counted towards seniority and pension for the simple reason that there
           were no posts in existence prior to 7.12.2002 and 1.9.2005, as discussed
           above.
           13.         There is no dispute that Assam Science Technology and
           Environment Council (ASTEC) is a Non Government Organization (NGO)
           which functions with grant-in-aid from the Government and all the relevant
           decisions of the Council are taken by its Governing Body and as such, it is
           clearly distinguishable from the Government Department. Therefore, the
           service of the employees of the Council is not comparable with the service of
           Govt. employees though there are some area of similarity with regard to
           certain service benefits and facilities. In view of the above, the arguments
WP(C) No.1834/2008                                                            Page 4 of 5

           advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that the
           benefits applicable to Govt. employees, shall also be applicable to the
           petitioners, is not acceptable.”
11.        The submission of Mr. De that the petitioner was appointed in the
temporary post of Junior Scientific Officer under the AST&EC pursuant to the
advertisement dated 28.11.1995 on the basis of an observation in the
advertisement, which reads, “temporary posts under the ASTE Council”, is found to
be without any merit. It is very specifically stipulated in the said advertisement that
temporary post of Junior Scientific Officer was in the Assam Bio-Research Centre and
accordingly, he was also appointed by the order dated 30.01.1996 at Assam Bio-
Research Centre. Assam Bio-Research Centre is a Project under the Environment
Division of AST&EC and the expression “temporary posts under the ASTE Council”
has to be understood in that context.
12.        It is not stated in the reply affidavit that a sanctioned vacant post of
Junior Scientific Officer was available prior to the meeting of the 8th Governing Body
held on 07.12.2002. Existence of a valid sanctioned post is a condition precedent for
regularization of the service of a person. Apparently, there was no available
sanctioned vacant post of Junior Scientific Officer for appointment of the petitioner
in ASTEC prior to 07.12.2002. Therefore, the claim of the petitioner for retrospective
regularisation is not tenable in law.
13.        Having regard to the above, I am of the considered opinion that there is
no merit in this writ petition and accordingly, the same is dismissed. No cost.
