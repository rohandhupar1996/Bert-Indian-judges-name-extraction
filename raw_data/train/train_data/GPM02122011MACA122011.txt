                                JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      In MAC. APP. No.10/2011 Appellant seeks enhancement of
        compensation in respect of a death of young boy Sushil Kumar
        aged about 20 years at the time of accident, which took place on
        30.07.2007.         The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the
        Tribunal) by the impugned award granted a compensation of `
        5,70,000/-.

2.      Similarly in MAC. APP. No.12/2011 Appellant seeks
        enhancement of compensation in respect of death of a young
        boy Rahul Sharma aged about 22 years at the time of accident,
        which took place on 30.10.2007. The Motor Accident Claims
        Tribunal (the Tribunal) by the impugned award assessed the
        compensation as ` 4,98,000/-.
3.      The difference in the compensation was on account of the age
        of the dependents, which is not in dispute.
4.      The common ground of challenge in both the appeals is that the
        deceased were doing a Fitter’s course from ITI, Bhalla (District
        Karnal) and, therefore, their potential employment and earning
        ought to have been considered by the Tribunal. A reference
        was made to Ramesh Chand Joshi v. New Indian Assurance
        Company, C-APP No.212-13/2006 wherein the potential
        earning of a B.E. student from Delhi College of Engineering
        was considered. The Tribunal reasoned that in Ramesh Chand
        Joshi case placement offers were filed on record to show that
        the candidates were being offered an average salary of `
        38,000/- per month. It is urged by the learned counsel for the
        Appellant that in this case also during hearing of the appeal the
        salary paid to one Praveen Kumar in the month of March, 2011
        was verified on the orders of this Court and it was found that
        Praveen Kumar was getting a gross salary of ` 9,040/- per
        month and a net salary of ` 8,182/- per month.

5.      The Tribunal while awarding the compensation considered the
        minimum wages of a skilled workmen (as the deceased was
        receiving vocational training for Fitter); the Tribunal added
        50% towards future prospects/ inflation and considered `
        6,000/- per month as the deceased’s income.          The learned
        counsel for the Respondent Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. placed
        on record a report from Hindustan Times dated 09.11.2011 to
        show that 30% of the ITI trained graduates were not getting
        jobs. It has to be borne in mind that ITI is not a prestigious
        institution. It is only a few, who gets placement in the reputed
        public sector companies, whereas, the rest have to be content in
        private organized and unorganized sector where they are paid
        the wages as fixed by the government under the Minimum
        Wages Act. Many do not even get employment.
6.      In the circumstances computation of compensation on the basis
        of the annual income of ` 72,000/- is just and reasonable.
7.      There is no ground to interfere with the impugned award, which
        was passed by a common judgment in both the appeals.
8.      The appeals are devoid of any merit. The same are accordingly
        dismissed.
                                                         (G.P. MITTAL)
