CORAM:-
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE BADAR DURREZ AHMED
      1.      Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see
              the judgment ?
      2.      To be referred to the Reporter or not ?
      3.      Whether the judgment should be reported in Digest ?
BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J. (ORAL)
1.      After hearing the counsel for the parties on preliminary issues, it appears
that the petitioners' case in all these matters, is founded upon the notification
dated 09.02.1978 issued by the Ministry of Works and Housing, Government of
India whereby the State Governments / Union Territories were directed to sell
the quarters built under the scheme to the allottees / occupants who have been
occupying the same. Essentially, this notification applied to Industrial Workers.
The notification also provided a rebate of 20% in the original costs in working
out the sale price to the occupants. It is on the basis and foundation of this
notification that the petitioners are challenging the impugned orders dated
10.05.2007 and 17.05.2007 passed by two different Additional District Judges
in appeals preferred by the petitioners under Section 9 of the Public Premises
(Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. In all these appeals the orders
of the Estate Officer directing eviction of the petitioners from the premises /
WP (C) No3992.07 & ors.                                                  Page No.4 of 7

quarters occupied by them in the course their (and/or their predecessor-in-
interests') former employment have been upheld.
2.      It has come to light in the course of arguments that earlier a writ petition
being WP(C) 570/1986 had been filed by some of the petitioners herein and / or
their predecessors-in-interest. That writ petition was filed in connection with
the said notification dated 09.02.1978. The petitioners therein had claimed
benefit under the said notification. However, a Division Bench of this court
while disposing of the said writ petition on 23.10.1986 rejected the plea taken
by the petitioners therein in the following terms :
              “CW No.572/86
                      After going through the counter-affidavit filed by
              Shri B.N. Chatterjee, General Manager, Hindustan
              insecticides Limited, respondent herein, we are satisfied
              that the quarters in dispute are not covered by the
              communication dated 9th February, 1978 sent by the
              Government of India, Ministry of Works and Housing to
              the Secretaries Incharge of Housing Departments to all the
              State Governments and Union Territories Administration.
              These quarters are simply owned by the company for the
              benefit of giving them on lease/licence to their employees.
              Therefore, no question arises for the quarters being
              transferred to the employees on ownership basis. There is
              thus no merit in the writ petition and the same is
              accordingly dismissed.
                                                 Yogeshwar Dayal, J
                                                 Malik Sharief-ud-Din, J
              October 23, 1986.”

3.      I am also informed by the counsel for the parties that the matter was
taken up to the Supreme Court in SLP (Civil) 976/1987. The Special Leave
Petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court at the admission stage on
23.03.1987.
4.      This makes it clear that the question of applicability of the notification
dated 09.02.1978 had been determined by a Division Bench of this court and the
same had not been disturbed by the Supreme Court.             As such, the said
determination that the quarters belonging to the petitioners are not covered by
the notification dated 09.02.1978 has become final. It is, therefore, not open for
this court to examine that issue again.
5.      Mr Rajiv Dutta, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners, submitted that subsequently in other petitions, in respect of other
concerns, the notification dated 09.02.1978 has been applied.          He further
submits that there are press notes available with him which indicate that, in
respect of other areas and other concerns, transfers of quarters occupied by
Industrial workers under this scheme have been carried out. However, that is
not for this court to consider inasmuch as I am bound by the decision of the
Division bench in WP(C) 572/1986 passed on 23.10.1986.

6.      The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners would
vacate the quarters occupied by them within two months. The undertaking in
the usual format to this effect be filed within four weeks.
        In view of the foregoing, these writ petitions are dismissed. No costs.
