Reason:
      (2)              The case in nutshell is as follows.    On 29 th January, 1995
      the deceased-Siddaramreddy went to his field along with his

                                      2
wife, Annapoornama (PW-3), and daughter, Tayamma (PW-4) for
keeping   watch   over  the   harvested   crops.    The   respondents,
accused no.1 to 8, are said to have formed an unlawful assembly
and attacked Siddaramreddy by beating him with clubs.
(3)  Upon    appreciation   of   evidence,   the  trial   court  found
accused No.1 guilty for the offence punishable under Section
302 I.P.C. and accused No(s).2 to 5 and 7 were found guilty for
the  offence    punishable   under  Section   302  I.P.C.   read  with
Section 149 I.P.C.      In the appeal, the conviction of accused
No(s).4 and 5 was set aside and they were on the ground that no
specific act was attributed to them.           So far as the other
accused, the conviction of accused No(s).1, 2, 3 and 7 was
modified into Section 304 Part-II read with Section 149 I.P.C.
as aforesaid.
(4)  Being aggrieved by the acquittal of accused No(s).4 and 5
and also the modification of the conviction as well as the
reduction   of   sentence   of  imprisonment   in  respect   of  other
accused, the State is before us.
(5)  The    respondents    though    initially   entered    appearance
through a counsel but by the time when the matter was taken up
for hearing learned counsel appearing for the respondents had
become   the   standing    counsel   of  the   State   of   Karnataka.
Therefore, the respondents-accused were remained unrepresented.
We  have    heard   Mr.   Joseph   Aristotle   S.,   learned   counsel
appearing for the appellant-State, who has taken us through the

                                    3
impugned order.   We have also perused the materials on record.
(6)  So  far   as   acquittal   of   accused   No(s).4    and  5  are
concerned,   the    High   Court   has   held    that   even   though
Annapoornama (PW-3) has mentioned the names of all the accused
in the complaint, she has not attributed any overt act to
accused No(s).4 and 5 and the High Court observed that in the
absence of any specific overt act attributed to accused no.4
and 5 they cannot be held guilty under Section 302 I.P.C. which
in  our  considered   view   cannot  be  said   to   be  unreasonable
warranting   interference    by  this   Court.      Insofar   as  the
modification   of  the   conviction  from  Section    302  I.P.C.  to
Section 304 Part-II I.P.C. and the reduction of the sentence of
imprisonment in respect of other accused are concerned, the
High Court has recorded its reasoning in para ‘15’ of the
order.  The High Court has observed that accused No.1 alone had
previous enmity with the deceased-Siddaramreddy and the other
accused appeared to have joined accused no.1 only to help him.
Considering the weapons used, namely, sticks and the nature of
the injuries, the High Court thought it fit to modify the
sentence of imprisonment under Section 302 I.P.C. to Section
304 Part-II I.P.C.    Occurrence was of the year 1995 and at this
distant point of time and also in view of the findings by the
High Court in para “55”, we are not inclined to interfere with
the impugned order.

                                 4
(7)  In the result, the appeal is dismissed.
