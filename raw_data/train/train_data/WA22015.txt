(M anojit Bhuyan, J)
         Heard Dr. B.N. Gogoi, learned counsel for the appellant as well
as Mr. S.K. Ghosh, learned counsel representing respondent no. 1/writ
petitioner. Also heard Mr. R.K.D. Choudhury, Senior Additional
Government Advocate for respondent nos. 2 to 6. Respondent no. 7
has put in appearance through Mr. D. Choudhury, Advocate.
         Leave to file the present appeal against the Order dated
12.12.2013 passed in WP(C) 2956/2008 was granted vide Order dated
16.12.2014 in MC 2059/2014 and the appeal was admitted for hearing
on 21.06.2017.
                                                                    Page 1 of 6

2.      The basic challenge to the Judgment & Order dated
12.12.2013 is on the point that the appellant was not arrayed as a
party respondent, despite being a necessary party and, as such, was
denied any opportunity of hearing and/or to highlight its stand on the
actual state of affairs as regards the land in question over which
dispute arose. To appreciate the stand of the appellant, it would be
essential to notice the basic facts involved in the present case.
3.      A plot of land measuring 12 Bighas 1 Katha 9 Dhoor covered
by Dag No. 45 of Khatian No. 1 in Dhubri Town was originally settled
with the respondent no. 1/writ petitioner’s father late Gayanath
Biswas. On the demise of Gayanath Biswas, the land in question was
mutated in the name of the appellant N.F. Railways instead of being
mutated in the name of the respondent no. 1/writ petitioner. This led
to institution of a suit i.e. Title Suit No. 320/1998 by the respondent
no. 1/writ petitioner before the Court of the Civil Judge (Junior
Division) No. 1, Dhubri for declaration of right, title and interest as
well as for confirmation of possession over the suit land in question.
Both the State of Assam as well as N.F. Railways were arrayed as
party defendants. The Title Suit was decreed on contest on
07.12.1999. The said respondent no. 1/writ petitioner instituted Title
Execution Case No. 12/2000 and the Executing Court passed Order
dated 20.06.2000 directing the District Collector, Dhubri to correct the
land records as per the decree. Events occurring thereafter came in
the form of applications made by third parties before the Settlement
Officer, Dhubri as well as before the Director of Land Records &
Surveys, Assam to refrain from making such correction in the land
records. Although such applications were rejected by the Director of
Land Records & Surveys by Order dated 25.11.2002 with consequent
direction to the Settlement Officer, Dhubri to correct the land records
as per the decree of the Civil Court, a letter came to be issued on
                                                               Page 2 of 6

13.12.2002 by the Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Revenue
(Settlement) Department, instructing the Settlement Officer, Dhubri
not to take steps for correction of land records. This letter of the
Deputy Secretary was issued on a petition filed by the respondent no.
7. Aggrieved, the respondent no. 1/writ petitioner had instituted
WP(C) 139/2003. As during the pendency of the said writ petition the
Revenue Authorities corrected the land records on 21.04.2003 by
recording the name of the respondent no. 1/writ petitioner as patta
holder of the suit land, the writ petition was closed on 14.05.2007 as
having been rendered infructuous and interim stay earlier granted
was vacated. The matter did not rest there. On 28.8.2007 the
Settlement Officer, Dhubri directed the Assistant Settlement Officer to
record the name of N.F. Railways as pattadar of the suit land, which
was accordingly done on 10.09.2007. This action prompted the
respondent no. 1/writ petitioner to prefer appeal under Section 147 of
the Assam Land & Revenue Regulation, 1886 before the Assam Board
of Revenue. The said appeal, however, stood dismissed on 08.7.2008
holding that in view of the bar under Section 154 of the Regulation,
the Civil Court was without jurisdiction to pass order or to issue
directions for correction of record-of-right. Constrained thus, the
related writ petition i.e. WP(C) 2956/2008 was instituted.
4.      The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition by setting
aside the order of the Assam Board of Revenue dated 08.7.2008 as
well as the order of the Assistant Settlement Officer, Dhubri dated
10.9.2007. Cost of Rs. 10,000.00 was imposed, to be payable in equal
proportion between the Settlement Officer, Dhubri and the Assistant
Settlement Officer, Dhubri for forcing unnecessary litigation on the
respondent no. 1/writ petitioner. The learned Single Judge held that
vacation of the interim order as and when WP(C) 139/2003 had
become infructuous could not have been construed in a manner that
                                                             Page 3 of 6

the name of the respondent no. 1/writ petitioner as recorded pattadar
of the suit land should be replaced with that of the name of the N.F.
Railways. The learned Single Judge also held that the Assam Board of
Revenue misconstrued Section 154 of the Regulation and by placing
reliance in the Full Bench decision of this Court in Daulatram Lakhani
v. the State of Assam and Others, reported in (1989) 1 GLR 131 held
that Section 154 of the Regulation does not bar the Civil Court from
entertaining suit for declaration of title. Further, without any order of
a higher forum reversing the decree passed by the Civil Court, it was
not open to a Revenue Board or any other authority to say that the
order of the Civil Court is a nullity and therefore they are not bound
by the order of the Civil Court.
5.      In the present proceedings the appellant submits that the
respondent no.1/ writ petitioner had obtained the decree in Title Suit
No. 320/1998 in a surreptitious and fraudulent manner without giving
notice to the Railways and by suppressing material facts that the land
in question actually belong to the Railways. It is further submitted
that the land in question has been under occupation of the appellant
since 1947 and in the Revenue records the said land was classified as
Khas land. The respondent no.1/ writ petitioner had only obtained
licence from the Railways for the purpose of fishing in the said land
and had once filed a writ petition, being WP(C) 6846/2001 challenging
cancellation of the licence. The appellant submits that these facts
could not be brought to the notice of the learned Single Judge as the
appellant was not impleaded as party respondent in the writ petition.
It is also averred by the appellant that the respondent no. 7 filed Title
Suit No. 249/2002 for cancellation of the decree passed in Title Suit
No. 320/1998 and since the same was pending adjudication, the
learned Single Judge ought not to have passed the impugned
Judgment & Order dated 12.12.2013.
                                                                Page 4 of 6

6.     We have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have
perused the materials on record. As regards the decree passed in Title
Suit 320/1998 is concerned, the pleadings on record show that the
N.F. Railways had challenged the same in Title Appeal No. 29/2015
along with delay condonation petition before the Court of Civil Judge,
Dhubri. The said appeal was dismissed on 05.01.2016, whereafter the
N.F. Railways preferred second appeal i.e. RSA No. 15/2017 before
this Court. Even the said second appeal was dismissed on 06.02.2017
after hearing both the parties and the Judgement & Decree dated
07.12.1999 passed in Title Suit No. 320/1998 was affirmed. It is also
seen that the decree has already been executed and the land records
have been duly corrected by the Revenue Authority. On a pointed
query, Dr. Gogoi informs this Court that a Special Leave Petition to
Appeal is pending before the Supreme Court as against the order
passed in RSA 15/2017.
7.     What is discernible from the above is that notwithstanding the
submissions of the appellant that the decree in Title Suit No.
320/1998 was obtained by misrepresentation and in a fraudulent
manner and Title Suit No. 249/2002 filed by the respondent no. 7 for
cancellation of the said decree is pending adjudication before the
competent court of law, fact remains that the said decree dated
07.12.1999 declaring right, title and interest of the respondent no.1/
writ petitioner over the land in question with confirmation of his
possession over it has remained undisturbed until this date. Without
reversal of the said decree by any higher forum, it was not open to
the Revenue Authority or the Assam Board of Revenue to question
the same. Taking judicial notice of subsequent events, it is also seen
that the decree dated 07.12.1999 was also confirmed in Title Appeal
No. 29/2015 filed by the N.F. Railways and also affirmed by this Court
in RSA 15/2017 vide Order dated 06.02.2017. As regards the pleading
                                                             Page 5 of 6

that the appellant was not made party respondent in the related writ
petition, we find that this position cannot go to dent the decree dated
07.12.1999 even if the appellant had been arrayed as respondent in
the writ petition. Legal remedies upto the filing of second appeal have
already been availed by the appellant challenging the decree dated
07.12.1999 by means of Title Appeal No. 29/2015 and RSA 15/2017,
albeit without any success. In fact, the decree dated 07.12.1999 has
already been executed and the land records recording the name of
the respondent no.1/ writ petitioner as patta holder of the suit land
has already been effected. In this view of the matter, we find that the
present writ appeal is misconceived and no relief whatsoever can be
granted to the appellant. To reiterate, the decree dated 07.12.1999 in
Title Suit No. 320/1998 have remained undisturbed until this date.
The right, title and interest of the respondent no.1/ writ petitioner
over the land in question in the light of the decree dated 07.12.1999
have thus      remained intact until this date. Steps taken by the
Revenue Authority in correcting the land records in favour of the
respondent no.1/ writ petitioner have also stood complete. As such,
we find no merit in the present appeal and/or to cause any
interference to the judgment & order passed by the learned Single
Judge in WP(C) 2956/2008. As a necessary corollary, this writ appeal
fails and stands dismissed, however, without any order as to costs.
