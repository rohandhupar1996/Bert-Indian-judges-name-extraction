         Heard Mr. D Borah, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Y
Doloi the learned Senior Central Government counsel for all the respondents.
2.          The brief facts for disposal of the writ petition may be noticed at the
outset. The writ petitioner was appointed as Executive Engineer (Electrical and
Mechanical) on 1.11.1985. He was thereafter promoted to the post of
Superintending Engineer (Electrical and Mechanical) on 1.9.2004. As per the 6th
Central Pay Commission recommendation, in order to remove stagnation, non-
functional upgradation scheme for Group-A services in Pay Band -3 and Pay
Band-4 was introduced in the organisation vide BRDB Office Memorandum
No.AB- 14017/64/2008-Estt.(RR) dated 24.4.2009, No.AD -14017/64/2008-Estt
(RR) dated 1.7.2010 and AB 14017/30/2011-Estt (RR) dated 11.7.2011. The non-
functional upgradation was in the pay scale of Rs.37400- 67000 with Grade pay
of Rs.10000/- in Pay Band-4. The officer junior to the petitioner was extended
the benefit of non-functional upgradation w.e.f 1.4.2011 vide communication
dated 2.2.2012. However, the petitioner was not given the benefit of non-
functional pay upgradation.
3.       The next grievance highlighted by the petitioner is with regard to his
downgrading the upgradation of his Annual Performance Assessment Report
        WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                 Page 2 of 11

(APAR) by the respondent authorities for the period (i) 17.8.2009- 31.3.2010 (ii)
13.8.2010 – 31.3.2011 and (iii) 26.4.2011 – 29.12.2011.
4.       For the purpose of convenience, the 3 APARS in question may be referred
to as (i), (ii), and (iii) respectively.
5.       For APAR (i), although the petitioner was graded as ‘very good’ with 7.9.
points by the Initiating Officer (I.O), the Reviewing Officer (R.O) downgraded
him to ‘good’ with 5 points and the same was accepted by the accepting
authority (A.O). For APAR (ii), the grading of ‘very good’ with 6 points given by
the I.O. was downgraded to ‘good’ with 5.8 points by the R.O and A.O . Likewise
the grading for the period (iii), I.O graded him as ‘very good’ with 6 points.
Although the R.O. maintained the grading, the A.O. downgraded the APAR
grading to ‘good’ (5.8 points). The downgrading according to the petitioner is
illegal and against the established norms and guidelines.
6.       The third grievance of the petitioner is that he was not given a command
posting by the respondent authorities despite his representation and which
otherwise was necessary to be eligible for non-functional upgradation of pay.
7.         Appearing for the petitioner, Mr. D Borah, the learned counsel submits
that there is no dispute with regard to the seniority list of Superintending
Engineer (Electrical and Mechanical) under the organisation as on 1.1.2011
         WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                 Page 3 of 11

wherein the petitioner has been placed at Serial No.2 of the list. However, the
respondent authorities by ignoring the seniority position of the petitioner have
given the person immediately junior to the petitioner whose name appears at
Serial No.3 of the seniority list the benefit of non-functional upgradation of pay
w.e.f. 1.4.2011 vide communication dated 2.2.2012. He submits that without
there being any adverse service record of the petitioner, the petitioner could not
have been deprived of the upgradation especially when his next junior officer in
the seniority list was given such benefit.
8.                  The learned counsel by referring to the APAR for the period (i)
submits that the grading of ‘very good’ given by the I.O. could not have been
downgraded to ‘good’ by the R.O. and subsequently accepted as ‘good’ by the
A.O. By referring to the dossier on preparation and maintenance of Annual
Performance Assessment Report (the guidelines), he submits that the system of
APAR on the performance of a Government Servant is a means to an end and not
an end in itself. The petitioner should therefore have been communicated about
the downgrading of his APAR by R.O on the decision to downgrading him prior to
same being accepted by the A.O within 15 days of the entries made in terms of
paragraph No.-2.13 (iii) of the guidelines. It is only when the petitioner fails to
submit his representation within the prescribed time that the grading given in his
APAR can be treated as final.
        WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                 Page 4 of 11

9.       Similarly for the assessment period of (ii) and (iii) of the APAR of the
petitioner, the grading given to him by the I.O. could not have been downgraded
without an intimation to him.
10.     The learned counsel for the petitioner by referring to the justification
assigned by the R.O. and A.O. for the period in question submits that the same
can hardly be a meaningful and relevant justification. No reasons have been
assigned by the superior officer concerned in downgrading the APAR of the
petitioner besides the non-compliance of the relevant guidelines.
11.        The petitioner after having submitted several representation to the
respondent authorities for downgrading of is APAR in question rejected his claim
for appropriate upgradation vide office memorandum dated 23.10.2013
(Annexure-P-13). However, by the impugned office memorandum dated
23.10.2013, the down grading APAR for the period (ii) was not considered by the
respondent authorities. He submits that the petitioner retired from service on
28.2.2017 and it was only for the panel year 2014-15 that he was given the
benefit of non-functional upgradation.
12.      The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that as regards the
command posting required for at least two years as per the relevant rules for
being considered for non-functional upgradation of pay, the discretion lies with
the respondent authorities and therefore to be posted as such is beyond the
        WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                 Page 5 of 11

control of the petitioner. The petitioner therefore having not been granted the
non-functional upgradation w.e.f. 1.4.2011 i.e. the date on which his next junior
was granted such benefit is before this Court.
13.       In order to substantiate his submission, the learned counsel Mr. D Borah
relies upon the decision of this Court in the case of Bharat Singh Panwar –vs-
Union of India reported in 2013 (2) GLT 1096 and the judgment and order dated
12.8.2015 rendered by a co-ordinate bench of this Court in WP (C) No.2218 of
2013 i.e. Sheo Balak Singh –vs- Union of India and Ors.
14.      The learned counsel submits that in case of Bharat Singh Panwar (supra),
this Court held that the system of APAR on the performance of a Government
servant is a means to an end and not an end in itself in as much the ultimate
goal is to optimise the achievement of Government policy and programme. This
is possible only if the APAR lead to the optimisation of the performance of the
concerned Government servant. The main focus of the R.O. should therefore be
developmental rather than judgmental. APAR should be a true indication of the
achievement of the Government servant. It should not be a mere tool to control
or discipline him. Besides accepting the dossier on preparation and maintenance
of confidential report, Court found that the downgrading of the APAR were
virtually without recording any reasons there of. The view of the Court was
endorsed adopted in case of Sheo Balak Singh (supra) wherein this Court by
referring to the Apex Court’s decision rendered in the case of Dev Dutt –vs-
         WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                Page 6 of 11

Union of India reported in 2008 (8) SCC 725 and Sukdev Singh –vs- Union of
India & Ors reported in 2013 (9) SCC 573 held that the respondent authorities
should promptly communicate to every Government Servant the grading given in
its APAR so that minimum remedial steps can be taken by the officer being
graded. Having found that the petitioner therein was not communicated about
the adverse entries made in the APARs of the petitioner, Court directed for fresh
consideration of the petitioner by remanding the matter back to the authority
concerned.
15.          The learned counsel for the petitioner therefore submits that the
petitioner similarly was denied of the same opportunity although he was
communicated his APAR grading in a much later stage, the respondent
authorities therefore be directed to grant the petitioner the non-functional
upgradation of his pay scale to Pay Band- 4 in the Grade Pay of Rs.10,000/-
w.e.f. 1.4.2011.
16.        Appearing for the respondents, the learned Senior Central Government
Counsel Mr. Y Doloi refers to the stand taken by the respondents in the affidavit-
in-opposition filed on 28.8.2015. He submits that the petitioner is only eligible for
grant of non-functional upgradation in accordance with the hierarchy of post
subject to fulfilling the criteria as laid down in R and P Rules. The petitioner was
required to complete two years of command experience as per the Rules to be
eligible for being given the benefit of non-functional upgradation. The petitioner
         WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                  Page 7 of 11

having completed the required steps only on 26.1.2013, he became eligible for
upgradation in the panel year of 2014-15. He further submits that the command
posting is not based on seniority alone. In fact in order to be eligible for such
posting, the performance of the officer concerned is also accounted for at the
consideration of APAR is not limited only for a certain period but is related to the
performance and overall efficiency in the post held by the officer. He submits
that although the petitioner may have not been timely communicated with the
downgrading in his APAR but nevertheless the R.O. and A.O. after properly
considering and evaluating the performance of the petitioner decided not to
accept the grading given by the I.O. and accordingly gave him a lower grading.
Mr. Y Doloi submits that proper means were in fact assigned by the R.O. and
A.O. before finally deciding upon the grading of the petitioner as was accepted.
17.       Mr. Y Doloi by referring to the Annexure-R-1 of the additional affidavit
filed by the respondent authorities on 20.4.2017 submits that the APARs of the
petitioner were indeed communicated to him although there was slight delay in
communicating the same to him.
18.        I have considered the submissions advanced by the learned counsel
appearing for the rival parties and I have also perused the materials available on
record. Clause-1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 of the dossier on preparation and
maintenance of Annual Performance Assessment Report provides the guidelines
as to how the I.O, R.O. and A.O. should act given a situation when there is
        WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                 Page 8 of 11

difference of opinion in the authority concerned as regard the grading given to
the employee concerned . Clause-2.13 (iii) provides a period of 15 days from the
date of receipt of entries in APAR to be communicated to the Assessed officer. It
is only upon the failure on the part of the officer concerned to submit his
representation upon the findings in the APARs that findings can be treated as
final. By perusing the chart prepared by the respondents and annexed as
Annexure-R-1 to their affidavit filed on 20.4.2017, it can be seen that the
petitioner was communicated the grading or downgrading made by the authority
concerned much beyond the period prescribed. Furthermore, the guidelines also
provides that the objective of the assessment officer is primarily to improved the
performance of the subordinate officer in his job and to assess the potentialities
of the subordinate officer by providing him appropriate feedback and guidelines
for future possible opportunity in services by timely communicating the
assessment made upon him. However, it can be seen that such opportunity was
not available to the petitioner and the impugned order passed through the office
memorandum dated 23.10.2013 besides failing to apprise the APAR for the
period (ii) do not disclose any reasoning by authority concerned in rejecting the
claim of the petitioner.
19.          The law with regard to non-communication of ACRs whether with
adverse remarks or otherwise is well settled as can be seen from the case of Dev
Dutt (supra) and Sukdev Singh (supra). Having regard to the facts and
circumstances in the case in its entirety, I am of the considered opinion that the
        WP (C) No. 2409 of 2015                                Page 9 of 11

petitioner was denied of the opportunity to make representation against the
downgrading made in his APARs under consideration by the respondent
authorities. In that view of the matter, the writ petition is disposed of with a
direction to the respondent No.2 to consider the case of the petitioner afresh
with regard to the APARs pertaining to the period (i) 17.8.2009 – 31.3.2010 (ii)
13.8.2010 – 31.3.2011 and (iii) 26.4.2011 – 29.12.2011 for granting him the
Non-Functional Grade of pay in the pay scale of Rs.37400- 67000 with Grade pay
of Rs.10,000/- in Pay Band-4 from the date on which his junior was given the
benefit i.e. 1.4.2011. The respondent No. 3 shall forward all the relevant records
required for consideration by the respondent No.2 within 15 days of receipt of a
certified copy of this order and the respondent No.2 shall thereafter consider and
take a decision within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of
communication from the respondent No.3. The impugned Office Memorandum
dated 23.10.2013 in so far as paragraph (b) of the same is concerned is set
aside. The decision taken by the respondent authorities shall be communicated
to the petitioner.
20.       It is needless to mention herein that in the event, the petitioner is found
to be eligible for upgradation of his pay, anterior to the date on which he was
given the benefit , his pay scale shall accordingly be refixed irrespective of the
fact that he has since retired from his service.

21.       With the above observations and directions, this writ petition stands
allowed. No cost.
