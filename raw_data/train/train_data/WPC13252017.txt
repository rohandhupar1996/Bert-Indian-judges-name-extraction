who had subsequently filed an application seeking leave of this Court to withdraw from
WP (C) 1325/2017.
2.      The facts, giving rise to the filing of these writ petitions, as apparent from the
record, lie in a short campus and are briefly narrated herein-below :-
        I)        The Deori Autonomous Council Act, 2005,( hereinafter referred to as
                 the Act of 2005) was enacted by the Assam Legislative Assembly so as
                 to provide for establishment of an autonomous authority within the
                 constitutional framework for social, economic, educational, ethnic and
                 cultural advancement of the members of Deori community. The General
                 Council of the said autonomous body consists of elected members and
                 in terms of the provisions of the Act of 2005, elections were held on
                 15/12/2016 for constitution of the General Council of the Deori
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                        Page 2 of 20

              Autonomous Council (hereinafter referred to as the DAC) . The results
              were declared on 17/12/2016. In the elections held on 15/12/2016, as
              many as 18 (eighteen) members were elected to the General Council.
       II)     On 04/02/2017, the Government of Assam had issued a notification
              convening the first meeting of the elected General Council on
              09/02/2017. The Deputy Commissioner of Lakhimpur district was
              authorised to administer the oath of office to the elected members of
              the General Council. Accordingly, the 18 elected members of the
              General Council took oath on 09/02/2017 and the said fact was also
              intimated to the Government by the communication dated 27/02/2017
              issued by the Principal Secretary of the DAC.
       III)   On 16/02/2017, 10 (ten) elected members of the council i.e. the writ
              petitioners in WP(C) 1325/2017, submitted a requisition addressed to
              the Chairman of the DAC making a request for convening a General
              Meeting of the General Council within a period of 7 (seven) days. When
              the said requisition was not acted upon, the aforesaid ten members had
              circulated a notice dated 22/02/2017 informing all elected members of
              the DAC that a Special General Meeting had been convened on
              23/02/2017 for discussing the agendas mentioned therein. The notice
              dated 22/02/2017 contained three agenda items, viz.-
              (i)     No Confidence motion against the Chief Executive Councillor
                      (CEC) Shri Madhab Deori and his Executive Council;
              (ii)    Removal of the Chief Executive Councillor Shri Madhab Deori
                      and his other Executive Councillors from their respective posts;
                      and
WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                    Page 3 of 20

              (iii)   Discussion regarding constitution of a new Executive Council
                      from the elected members.
       IV)    On the basis of the notice dated 22/02/2017, a meeting was held on
              23/02/2017 wherein, a resolution expressing want of confidence in the
              Chief Executive Councillor and his Executive Councillors was adopted.
              In the said meeting, the writ petitioner no. 1 in W.P.(c) No. 1325/2017
              was elected as the Chairman of the Council, the petitioner 11 was
              elected as the Deputy Chairman, the petitioner no. 3 was elected as
              Chief Executive Councillor, the petitioner no. 8 was elected as Deputy
              Chief Executive Councillor and the petitioner nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were
              elected as Executive Councillors. A copy of the aforesaid resolution was
              thereafter, sent to the Government with a request to approve the same
              and take necessary steps for fixing the date of oath taking ceremony of
              the newly constituted body. Since the Government refused to act on the
              said   resolution,   the   present   writ   petition was   filed   by  the
              aforementioned petitioners seeking a writ of mandamus directing the
              respondent authorities to approve the resolution dated 23/02/2017 and
              also to administer oath of office to the newly elected Executive
              Councillors.
       V)     During the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition, an additional
              affidavit was filed on behalf of the petitioners in WP(C) 1325/2017 with
              a supplementary prayer for issuance of a direction upon the authorities
              to arrange for a floor test to prove the majority support of the Executive
              Council of the DAC.
       VI)    WP(C) 1371/2017, on the other hand, was preferred by the 7 (seven)
              petitioners i.e. the respondent nos 6 to 12 in W.P.(c) 1325/2017, who
WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                     Page 4 of 20

                constitute the Executive Council, assailing the resolution dated
                23/02/2017 inter-alia on the ground that the same was de hors the
                statute and, hence, liable to be declared as illegal and non-est in the
                eye of law.
3.      The respondent no. 2 i.e. the Commissioner and Secretary, Government of
Assam, WPT & BC Department, has filed counter affidavit in WP(C) 1325/2017
contesting the claim of the petitioners therein, inter-alia contending that the meeting
held on 23/02/2017 was in clear violation of the statutory provisions contained in
Section 13(1) and 17(3) of the Act of 2005 and, therefore, the resolution adopted
there-in was illegal and in-operable in the eye of law. In the said affidavit, it has
further been stated that the writ petitioners have approached this Court by making
contradictory prayers, inasmuch as, they could not have prayed for a mandamus
seeking approval of the resolution dated 23/02/2017 and at the same time ask for a
floor test.
4.      Mr. K.N. Choudhury, learned senior counsel has argued that the respondent
nos. 6 to 12, who are the office bearers of the Executive Council, in their failure to
appropriately respond to the requisition dated 16/02/2017 has displayed complete
apathy towards the cause of the General Council members. Under the circumstances,
the only option left open for the writ petitioners was to seek their removal by invoking
Section 9 of the Act of 2005. Mr. Choudhury further submits that the notice dated
22/02/2017 had been duly circulated amongst all the members of the Executive
Council and the said fact would stand established from the records. Since the
Executive Council members including the Chief Executive Councillor were aware of the
agenda items to be discussed in the meeting, it must be presumed that they had
sufficient notice about the convention of the meeting by the writ petitioners. According
to the learned senior counsel, in the absence of any specific provision in the Act 2005
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                      Page 5 of 20

requiring the requisition for convening a special meeting for discussing the no
confidence motion to be addressed to a particular authority, the recourse adopted by
the petitioners for removal of the existing members of the Executive Council, in the
circumstances of the case, cannot be held to be un-lawful.
5.       Mr. Choudhury, has further contended that an elected body in a democratic
institution such as the DAC would have a right to continue in office so long as it enjoys
the confidence of the majority of the elected members. The fact that ten out of
eighteen elected members had signed the resolution 23/02/2017 seeking removal of
the existing body from office would establish beyond doubt that the existing executive
body was in a minority and, therefore, did not have the right to continue in office. At
the same time, submits Mr. Choudhury, the support of the majority members in favour
of the newly elected body is apparent from the resolution dated 23/02/2017, which
holds out a clear mandate to govern in their favour. Under such circumstances,
submits Mr. Choudhury, even if there is any technical deficiency in the convention of
the meeting on 23/02/2017, the same would not per se invalidate the mandate
contained in the resolution adopted therein since the requisition dated 22/02/2017 was
in substantive compliance with the democratic norms traceable to the constitutional
philosophy. Mr. Choudhury submits that the procedure for discussing no confidence
motion cannot be equated with the process required to be followed for removal from
office pursuant to a disciplinary action. As such, observance of the principles of natural
justice, according to the learned senior counsel, would be un-necessary in such a
situation. In support of his aforesaid arguments, Mr. Choudhury has relied upon the
following decisions :-
         i)     (1992) 4SCC 80 (Mohan Lal Tripathi Vs. District Magistrate, Rai Bareilly
                and others);
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                     Page 6 of 20

        ii)    (2011) 9 SCC 573 (Pratap Chandra Mehta Vs. State Bar Council of
               Madhya Pradesh and others);
        iii)   (1974) 2 SCC 706 (Babubhai Muljibhai Patel Vs. Nandlal Khodidas Barot
               and others);
        iv)    (2010) 12 SCC 1 (Bhanumati and others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh
               through Principal Secretary and others); and
        v)     (2014) 7 SCC 663 (Usha Bharati Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others).
6.       Mr. S.N. Sarma, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in WP(C)
1371/2017, on the other hand, contends that the procedure for removal of the Chief
Executive Councillor and other Councillors has been provided under Section 9(1) of the
Act of 2005. Section 13 of the Act prescribed the procedures for convening a meeting
of the General Council, according to which, the meeting is required to be held at the
headquarters of the DAC and at such time as may be notified by the DAC. Therefore,
submits Mr. Sarma, the resolution adopted in a meeting not convened as per the
mandate of Section 13 of the Act would be illegal and, therefore, would not have any
force in the eye of law. Mr. Sarma has further argued that although the Act of 2005
does not indicate as to who should convene the meeting, yet, by reading the provision
of the Act, the Court would be called upon to constructively interpret the different
provisions of the Act so as to give due meaning to the legislative intent. Since the
Legislature had never intended to permit any meeting to be privately convened by the
elected members, that too for expressing “no confidence” on the Executive Body, the
resolution dated 23/02/2017, according to Mr Sarma, is liable to be declared as illegal,
null and void. In support of his aforesaid argument, Mr. Sarma has relied upon a
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Vipulbhai M. Chaudhary Vs. Gujarat
Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited and others reported in (2015) 8 SCC 1.
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                   Page 7 of 20

7.      Mr. D. Saikia, learned Senior Additional Advocate General, Assam, appearing
for the State has supported the arguments advanced by Mr. S.N.Sarma, learned senior
counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) 1371/2017 and has further contended that as per
section 17(3) of the Act of 2005, the presence of the Principal Secretary of the Council
in every meeting of the DAC is mandatory but in the meeting held on 23/02/2017, the
Secretary of the DAC was admittedly not present. As a matter of fact, submits Mr.
Saikia, there was no requisition submitted to the Principal Secretary requesting for
convening a special meeting. Since, section 17(3) of the Act mentions about all
meetings, hence, submits Mr. Saikia, the said provision would also be applicable to a
special meeting convened so as to transact business under section 9(1) of the Act as
well.
8.      Referring to the contents of the notice dated 22/02/2017, Mr. Saikia submits
that a bare reading of the same would go to show that it is not a requisition but in
fact, was a notice informing about the meeting convened on 23/02.2017 by the writ
petitioner in W.P. (C) No 1325/2017. Since section 9 permits a special meeting to be
called on the basis of a requisition made in writing, the meeting convened on
23/02/2017 de hors a requisition cannot be held to be valid. Mr. Saikia, has summed
up his arguments with the submission that a resolution adopted in a privately
organised meeting, in an undisclosed venue and in violation of Section 13(1) and 17(3)
of the Act cannot be taken cognizance of by the State and that is the reason no action
had been taken in the matter by the Government.
9.      I have considered the rival submissions made at the bar and have also perused
the records produced by Mr. J.C. Gogoi, learned counsel representing the DAC. After
hearing the learned counsel for the parties at length, it is apparent that the outcome
of these writ petitions would depend on the answer to the key question as to whether
the resolution dated 23/02/2017 can be clothed with any degree of legitimacy in the
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                    Page 8 of 20

facts and circumstances of the case. In order to answer the said question, a brief
reference to the relevant provision of the Act of 2005 is deemed necessary.
10.     Pursuant to the signing of the “Deori Accord”, the Assam State Legislative
Assembly had enacted “The Deori Autonomous Council Act, 2005”, paving the way for
establishment of Deori Autonomous Counsel (DAC). As mentioned above, the
underlying objective of the Act is to provide maximum autonomy to the council within
the constitutional framework, providing an opportunity for rapid, social, economical,
cultural autonomy of the Deori community living within the State.
11.      Section 5 of the Act of 2005 provides for a General Council, which shall be a
body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal with powers to
acquire, hold and dispose of property. Section 6(1) of the Act provides that the
General Council shall consist of 20 members, out of which 18 (eighteen) shall be
elected members and the remaining 2 (two) shall be nominated by the Government of
Assam to represent those groups/communities within the Council area which are
otherwise not represented. In addition, the Members of Parliament and the Members
of the Assam Legislative Assembly belonging to the Schedule Tribe reserved
constituencies coming under the Council area would be the ex-officio members of the
General Council. Section 6(4) further provides that at the first meeting after the
election, the elected members of the General Council, for the purpose of constitution
of the Executive Council, shall elect one member to be the Chairman, one member to
be the Deputy Chairman, one Chief Executive Councillor, one Deputy Chief Executive
Councillor and as many Executive Councillors, as may be decided by the General
Council but not exceeding one third of the total number of members of the General
Council.
12.      As per Section 7 of the Act of 2005, the term of office of the General Council is
for 5 (five) years with effect from the date of the first meeting as appointed by the
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                      Page 9 of 20

Government after the election of the members unless dissolved earlier. Section 8
stipulates that a member of the General Council can demit office by tendering
resignation in writing to the Chief Executive Councillor but in the case of the Chief
Executive Councillor, such notice of resignation is required to be addressed to any of
the Executive Councillor.
13.      Section 9 of the Act of 2005 makes provision for removal of the members of
the General Council by a resolution carried by the total number of the elected
members in a special meeting of the General Council called for the purpose. As per
section 9(2), the Government may also, after giving an opportunity to show cause,
remove a member of the General Council from office on the grounds mentioned there-
in.
Section 9 is quoted herein below for ready reference :-
        “9. R em oval of M em bers of General Council. - (1) The Chief Executive
        Councilor or the Executive Councilors or any one of them or all of them may be
        removed from office by a resolution carried by a majority of the total number
        of the elected members at a special meeting of the General Council called for
        the purpose upon a requisition made in writing by not less than one third of the
        Members of the General Council.
        (2) The Government, after giving an opportunity to an elected Member of the
        General Council to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against
        him and after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard, may by order,
        remove him from the office, if he-
                (a) after his election, is convicted by a criminal court of an offence
                involving moral turpitude punishable with imprisonment for any period
                exceeding six months, or
                (b) Incurs any of the disqualifications mentioned in section 54 after his
                election as Member of the General Council, or
                (c) is absent from three consecutive meetings of the General Council.

         (3) Any Member of the General Council who is removed from the office under
         sub-section (2) above, may within thirty days from the date of the order,
         appeal to such Judicial Authority as the Government may prescribe and the
         authority so prescribed after admitting an appeal may, after complying with the
         normal and fundamental principles of judicial proceedings, pass such order or
         orders either confirming or modifying or setting aside the order appealed
         against and pending the final disposal of the appeal may pass such other
         interlocutory order or orders including stay of. operation of the order appealed
         against.
         (4) The order passed by the Judicial Authority referred to in sub-section(3)
         above, on such appeal shall be final.”
14.      Section 24 of the Act of 2005 makes provision for an “Executive Council” which
shall consist of the Chief Executive Councillor (CEC) and as many Executive Councillors
as may be permissible under section 6(4). Section 25 of the Act of 2005 deals with the
term of Office of the members of the Executive Council, according to which, a member
shall hold office until he ceases to be a member of the General Council or resigns from
his office in writing.
15.      A careful reading of the different provisions of the Act of 2005 goes to show
that there is a provision in the form of section 9 of the Act permitting removal of the
members of the General Council from office but the Act of 2005 is silent about removal
of a member of the Executive Council including the Chief Executive Councillor from
office. Rather, a combine reading of section 9 and 25 of the Act of 2005 goes to show
that the only way the Chief Executive Councillor or an Executive Councillor can be
removed from office is by way of removing him from the membership of the General
Council by invoking section 9.
16.      Section 13 of the Act lays down the procedure for holding meetings of the
General Council. Section 13 is quoted herein below for ready reference :-
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                       Page 11 of 20

        “13. M eeting of the General Council. - (1) The General Council shall meet
        at least once in every three months for transaction of its business.
        (2) The meeting of the General Council shall be held at the headquarter of the
        Deori Autonomous Council at such time as may be notified by the Chief
        Executive Councilor :
        Provided that the first meeting of the General Council after the election shall be
        held on such date as may be appointed by the Government.”
17.     Section 17(1) of the Act provides for a Secretariat for the Council to be headed
by a Principal Secretary to be appointed by the Government in consultation with the
Chief Executive Councillor. As per Section 17(2), the Principal Secretary shall be the
Principal Executive Officer of the General Council and all other officers of the General
Council shall be subordinate to him. Section 17(3) mandates that the Principal
Secretary shall remain present and take part in all the discussions and meetings of the
General Council. Section 17(3) is quoted herein below for ready reference :-
        “17 (3). The Principal Secretary shall be present and take part in the discussion
        of all the meetings of the General Council or the Executive Council or any
        Committee of the General Council and may, with the consent of the Chief
        Executive Councilor or any other person presiding over such meeting for the
        time being, as the case may be, at any time make a statement or give
        explanation of the facts and circumstances but shall not be entitled to vote in
        any such meeting.”
18.     As noticed above, section 9 of the Act of 2005 only makes provision for
removal of Members of the General Council in a special meeting convened on the basis
of a requisition made in writing by not less than 1/3rd of the members. However, the
Act of 2005 does not indicate as to the authority to whom the requisition should be
addressed nor does it indicate as to who should convene the special meeting and with
whose approval. The Act of 2005 is also silent about the procedure to be followed in
case no special meeting is convened for removal of Members of the General Council as
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                      Page 12 of 20

per the requisition submitted by one third of the members. The absence of any specific
provision in the Act of 2005 covering the above aspect of the matter assumes special
significance in a case where a no confidence motion is being proposed against a
member of the General Council who is also holding the office of the Chief Executive
Councillor or Executive Councillors. In the Act of 2005 there is also no indication as to
the procedure that needs to be followed on receipt of a requisition for convening a
meeting for discussion of a No Confidence Motion. Under the above facts and
circumstances, this Court is called upon to interpret the provisions of the Act of 2005
so as to adjudicate upon the question of legality and validity of the resolution dated
23/02/2017.
19.      Law is settled that when the codifying statute is silent on a point than it is
permissible to look at other similar laws [see (1999) 7 SCC 359, 11 Port of Bombay v
Sriyanesh Knitters ]. As such, a cursory look at the Assam Panchayat Act, 1994, which
contains legal provisions laying down the procedure for removal of the elected
President and Vice-President of the Goan Panchayat from office, may be useful. The
Assam Panchayat Act, 1994 had          been enacted by the Assam State Legislative
Assembly, which contains a      provision in the form of section 15     laying down the
procedure for removal of the President/ Vice -President of the Gaon Panchayat on the
basis of “No confidence” motion proposed by the members. As per section 15(2) of the
Act of 1994, a special meeting for discussing the no-confidence motion brought against
the President/ Vice-President of the Gaon Panchayat can be convened when a
requisition, signed by not less than one third of the total number of members of the
Gaon Panchayat, is delivered to the President or the Vice President, as the case may
be. As per section 15 (1), such a meeting is required to be specially convened by the
Secretary of the Gaon Panchayat with the approval of the President. It is only when
the president fails to give approval for holding the meeting within the prescribed
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                     Page 13 of 20

period that the Secretary is required to move the higher authority i.e. the Anchalik
Panchayat President for convening the meeting within the time frame provided in the
Act. Section 15(5) of the Act of 1994 further provides that when the members express
want of confidence both in the President and the Vice-President of the Gaon Panchayat
at the same time, the Secretary of the Gaon Panchayat to report the matter to the
President of the Anchalik Panchayat. In the above manner, section 15(1) to 15 (5) of
the Act of 1994 lays down the code for convening the special meeting for removal of
the President/ Vice-President of the Gaon Panchayat based on a no-confidence motion.
20.      Similarly, section 28 of the Assam Municipal Act, 1956, provides for removal of
the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Municipal Board by a resolution of the Board in
favour of which not less than half of the total number of Commissioners has given
their votes at a meeting specially convened for the purpose. Section 43 of the Act of
1956 lays down the procedure for holding Ordinary and Special meetings and
according to section 43(2),the Chairman or in his absence, the Vice-Chairman may call
a special meeting whenever he thinks fit and shall call one on a requisition by not less
than three of the Commissioner. As per subsection 3 of section 43, the persons who
signed the requisition may call the meeting if the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman fails
to call the special meeting within twenty days after such a requisition has been made.
Therefore, the Act of 1956 makes a statutory provision for permitting the members
who had submitted the requisition to convene a special meeting if the condition
precedent is met.
21.      Likewise, section 169 of the Companies Act 1956 permits the members of the
company to call for Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (EOGM) if the Board of Directors
fails to call the meeting within twenty days from the date of deposit of a valid
requisition.
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                     Page 14 of 20

22.     Both in the case the Assam Municipal Act, 1956 and the Companies Act, 1956,
the statute itself makes provision permitting the members submitting the requisition to
convene the special meeting/ EOGM on their own in the event of failure of the
designated authority to do so within the prescribed time limit. But in the Act of 2005,
there is no such provision permitting the members of the General Council to convene a
meeting on their own in case the designated authority fails to discharge their
obligation under the statute.
23.     In the case of Vipulbhai M. Chaudhury (supra) the Hon’ble Supreme Court has
categorically held that if a statute is silent or imprecise on requirements under the
Constitution, it is for the Court to read constitutional mandate into those provisions
and make declaration accordingly. Observations made in paragraph 46 is deemed to
be relevant for the purpose of this case and is therefore, extracted herein below :-
                “46.    In the background of the constitutional mandate, the question is
                not what the statute does say but what the statute must say. If the Act
                or the Rules or the Bye-laws do not say what they should say in terms
                of the Constitution, it is the duty of the court to read the constitutional
                spirit and concept into the Acts. "In so far as in its Act Parliament does
                not convey its intention clearly, expressly and completely, it is taken to
                require the enforcement agencies who are charged with the duty of
                applying legislation to spell out the detail of its legal meaning. This may
                be done either- (a) by finding and declaring implications in the words
                used by the legislator, or (b) by regarding the breadth or other
                obscurity of the express language as conferring a delegated legislative
                power to elaborate its meaning in accordance with public policy
                (including legal policy) and the purpose of the legislation."
24.     In a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Goa v Western
Builders reported in (2006) 6 SCC 239 it has been observed that if the statute is silent
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                         Page 15 of 20

and there is no specific prohibition then the statute should be interpreted in a manner
which advances the cause of justice.
25.     Again, in the case of State of Kerala v Unni (2007) 2 SCC 365, it has been held
that interpretation of statute rests on the principles of reasonableness, equity as well
as good conscience.
26.     In the case of Gurudevdutta VKSSS Maryadit v State of Maharastra reported in
(2001) 4 SCC 534, the Supreme Court has observed that the cardinal principle of
interpretation of statute is that the words of a statute must be understood in their
natural, ordinary or popular sense and construed according to their grammatical
meaning, unless such construction leads to some absurdity or there is something in
the context or in the object of the statute to suggest to the contrary.
27.      Law is well settled that the general principle of interpretation of statute
requires that the statute must e read as a whole. As noted above, the Act of 2005
does not contain any specific provision laying down the manner in which a special
meeting for discussion of no confidence motion is required to be convened. Section 13
(1) of the Act, which deals with meetings of the General Council, merely speaks of the
duration between two such meeting and the place and time of holding the meeting.
Sub-section 2 of section 13, however, categorically mentioned that it is the Chief
Executive Councillor who would notify the time of holding the meeting. There is no
other provision in the Act which deals with holding of meeting of the General Council.
28.      From the scheme of the Act of 2005, it is clear that a member of the General
Council can be removed in a special meeting of the General Council. Therefore, in the
absence of any contrary provision contained in the Act, the meeting referred to in
section 13(1) of the Act must be held to include all meetings of the General Council
including a special meeting to discuss the no-confidence motion. Since, such meeting
is required to be held at a time to be notified by the Chief Executive Councillor, it
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                       Page 16 of 20

would logically follow that the meeting has to be convened with the approval of the
Chief Executive Councillor. Therefore, this court is of the view that the requisition
referred to in section 9 of the Act of 2005 must be presented before the Chief
Executive Councillor seeking his approval for convening the meeting, unless ofcourse
the motion of no confidence is proposed against the Chef Executive himself, in which
event, it must be put up before any of the Executive Councillor.
29.      A reading of Section 17(3) also indicates of a definite role of the Principal
Secretary of the Council in every meeting of the General Council. For the reasons
stated above, a special meeting for removal of the Executive Councillor would also
have to be treated as a meeting of the General Council since such a meeting would
require notice to be circulated to the members of the General Council. Convention of a
meeting is undoubtedly a Secretarial function. Since, the presence of the Principal
Secretary in all meeting of the General Council is mandated by section 17(3), it is thus
obvious that under the Act of 2005, it is the Principal Secretary who is entrusted with
the responsibility of convening the special meeting under section 9 of the Act so as to
discuss a no confidence motion brought against the members.
30.     Coming to the facts of the case in hand, the Executive Council of the DAC had
been constituted on 09/02/2017 and within a period of less than two weeks, the Notice
dated 22/02/2017 was circulated by ten members of the General Council seeking
removal of the Chief Executive Councillor and the other Executive Councillors but in
the said notice it has no where been mentioned that their removal is being sought
from the membership of the General Council. Since, the Act of 2005 does not contain
any provision for removal of the Chief Executive Councillor or the other Executive
Councillors from office without seeking their removal from the membership of the
General Council, the question of removal of the members of the Executive Council in a
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                    Page 17 of 20

meeting held on the basis of the Notice dated 22/02/2017 cannot arise in the eye of
law.
31.     That apart, the ten members issuing the notice dated 22/02/2017 were not
competent to convene the meeting on 23/02/2017 on their own since there is no such
provision in the Act of 2005 permitting them to do so. Moreover, I find from the record
that the notice dated 22/02/2017 is not a requisition for convening a special meeting
and there is no valid requisition submitted before any authority with a request to
convene a special meeting to discuss a no confidence motion. It is not in dispute that
the requisition dated 16/02/2017 was not for convening a special meeting to discuss
proposal of no confidence against the Executive Council members.
32.      Record further reveals that no copy of the Notice dated 22/02/2017 was
formally served upon the Principal Secretary of the Council. For the above stated
reasons, the notice circulated on 22/02/2017 cannot be held to be a requisition within
the meaning of section 9 of the Act and hence, the proceedings held on 23/02/2017
was evidently dehors the law .
33.     There is another significant aspect of the matter which needs to be mentioned
herein. While section 9 of the Act of 2005 permits removal of the members of the
General Council from office, the said provisions does not permit election of a new
Executive Council members in the same meeting. Under the Act of 2005, the
constitution of the Executive Council can only be done as per the procedure laid down
in section 6(4) of the Act and that too at the first meeting of the General Council after
the election. The Act of 2005, however, does not clearly spell out as to what would be
the procedure to be followed for constitution of the Executive Council in the event the
office of the Chief Executive Councillor or Executive Councillors falls vacant before
completion of the term. What is, however, clear beyond any shade of doubt is that the
ten members of the General Council, did not have any authority or jurisdiction to
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                     Page 18 of 20

constitute a new Executive Council in a privately convened meeting without the
involvement of the Government of Assam. I, therefore, find sufficient force in the
submission of Mr Siakia on the above point.
34.     As noticed above, the DAC is a statutory body having a fixed tenure of 5 years
which can be cut short on being dissolved under section 68 of the Act. The members
of the General Council are directly elected by a special electorate on the basis of a
voters’ list prepared as per section 50 of the Act of 2005. The Executive Council is
constituted from amongst the elected members of the General Council. It is, therefore,
obvious that the members of the Executive Council would remain in office during the
elected term as long as they enjoy the confidence of the majority of the elected
members. There can be no quarrel with the proposition advanced by Mr. Choudhury,
that in a democratic institution, no executive body can continue to remain in power
without the confidence of the majority of the elected members. But what must also be
borne in mind is that the removal of the Chief Executive Councillor/ Executive
Councillors or for that matter, any elected member from office has to be done strictly
in accordance with the prescription of law as otherwise the same would lead to chaos
and instability in the organisation posing a serious a threat to the very survival of the
democratic institution. It would be pertinent to mention here-in that although the
petitioners in W.P.(c) 1325/2017 had initially made a prayer for “floor test”, yet, during
the course of argument, Mr. Choudhury did not press for the same although the
opponent group was apparently ready to face a “floor test”.
35.     Section 13 of the Act of 2005 speaks of a meeting of the General Council which
is required to be notified by the Chief Executive Councillor. Although the term
“notified” has not been defined in the Act, yet, in the absence of any contrary
provision contained in the Act, it must be understood that the Chief Executive
Councillor would have a statutory role in granting approval and ensuring convention of
 WP(C) 1325/2017 & 1371/2017- CAV                                     Page 19 of 20

every meeting of the General Council. Moreover, since a proposal expressing want of
confidence against the Chief Executive Councillor is likely to entail serious adverse
consequences, it would be wholly un-just to deny reasonable time and opportunity to
the said elected authority to suitably respond to the requisition. Therefore, the
interpretation assigned to section 9 of the Act by Mr. Choudhury, if accepted, in the
opinion of this court, would not only negate the intention of the legislature but would
also frustrate the Act of 2005.
36.       For the reasons stated here-in above, the proceeding held on 23/02/2017 on
the basis of the notice dated 22/02/2017 is held to unsustainable in the eye of law and
the same is hereby, declared as null and void.
    Consequently, WP(C) No.1325/2017 is held to be devoid of any merit and is
accordingly dismissed.
    In the result, WP(c) No.1371/2017 stands allowed.
37.       Before parting with the record, this court would like to observe that as noticed
above, the Act of 2005 appears to be imprecise on a few important aspects leaving
room for more such controversies in the future. The learned Senior Additional
Advocate General, Assam has also fairly submitted that the Act of 2005 calls for a re-
visit. It is for the legislature to remedy the situation by making suitable amendments to
the Act. Therefore, in the light of the observations made here-in above, the
Government may take appropriate steps in the matter, if so advised.
               There would be no order as to costs.
               The records be returned back forthwith.
                                                                             JUDGE
