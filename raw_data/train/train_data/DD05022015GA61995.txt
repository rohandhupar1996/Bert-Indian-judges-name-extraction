PRESENT :
                         THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE D.DASH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date of hearing : 30.01.2015                 :     Date of judgment: 05.02.2015
                  The State has filed this appeal for enhancement of
sentence imposed upon the respondents having been found guilty for
commission of offence under section 307 of IPC. By the said order
these      respondents           have      been       directed       to     undergo        rigorous
imprisonment for a period of three years and six months with the
usual benefit of set off.
2.                Learned counsel for the State submits that in a case of
such nature, where respondents have been found to have committed

                                    -2-
offence under section 307 of IPC, the sentence is highly inappropriate
and that according to her does not fit in with the nature and gravity of
the offence even though the factum of enmity is found out. So, she
urges that it is a fit case for enhancement of sentence. According to
her, in view of the quantum of sentence which is on a lower side,
there has been failure of justice.
3.           Learned counsel for the respondents submits that after
lapse of two decades now, at this distance of time it would be rather
causing injustice by enhancement of sentence. According to him, if
the factual setting of the case is seen, the sentence imposed cannot be
said to be so low as to shock the conscience. Therefore, he urges that
the appeal bears no merit.
4.           On such rival submission, it is seen that the incident for
which the case was initiated had taken place on 01.02.1994 and the
last round of the incident is said to have taken place on the land of
the injured where the respondents had gone being armed with
weapons. It is also the case that they were in enmical terms at that
time. The incident took place after hurling of abusive language and
throwing of stones. Three respondents are by now in the age group of
seventy   to  seventy    five  and   rest  two   respondents  are  now
approximately aged about forty five and forty three.

                                     -3-
5.      Cumulatively viewing all those above said, this Court is not
inclined to enhance the sentence inflicted upon the respondents.
6.             In the result, the appeal stands dismissed.
                                                   …………………………
