1.            This writ petition was filed by the petitioner challenging the
order dated 28.5.1996 whereby the petitioner was dismissed from services.
2.            Before me, the only point which is urged on behalf of the
petitioner is that after the report of the enquiry officer was received, and
which exonerated the petitioner on some charges, the disciplinary authority
upset the findings of the enquiry officer by holding the petitioner guilty
without giving a hearing to the petitioner. The disciplinary authority on
WP(C) No.1026/1997                                                  Page 1 of 3

disagreeing with the findings of the enquiry officer imposed a penalty of
dismissal from services on the petitioner. It is therefore argued before me
that with respect to those charges for which the petitioner was exonerated by
the enquiry officer, before the disciplinary authority passed an order to set
aside such findings of the enquiry officer qua those charges, the petitioner
ought to have been personally heard.
3.            I have perused the record which is brought of the departmental
proceedings. There is no record of the disciplinary authority showing that
any written notice was given to the petitioner that the disciplinary authority
proposes to set aside the conclusions and findings of the enquiry officer and
the petitioner is thus called for a hearing.        Though the noting of the
disciplinary authority records that petitioner was present, however,
signatures of the present petitioner do not appear in the noting to show that
the petitioner was ever present. Also, there is nothing on record to indicate
that the petitioner was informed of the proposed action by the disciplinary
authority to set aside the findings of the enquiry officer.
4.            In view of the aforesaid position, since the petitioner had been
prejudiced by the action of the disciplinary authority whereby the
disciplinary authority had passed        an order against the petitioner for
WP(C) No.1026/1997                                                 Page 2 of 3

dismissal from services by setting aside the findings and conclusions of the
enquiry officer qua some of the findings inasmuch as the petitioner was not
given any hearing, the impugned order dated 28.5.1996 is set aside for the
limited purpose of the disciplinary authority giving a personal hearing to the
petitioner and whereafter the disciplinary authority may pass its orders in
accordance with law.
5.           For the sake of clarification, I note that it is agreed by the
petitioner that though the impugned order dated 28.5.1996 is set aside, the
effect thereof will however remain till a fresh order is passed by the
disciplinary authority, but in case the disciplinary authority does not pass an
order of removal of the petitioner from services, then, the disciplinary
authority will pass appropriate consequential orders.         The disciplinary
authority will after hearing the petitioner pass its orders within a period of
three months from today. The petitioner or his counsel will be given a
written notice of the date of hearing which is fixed before the disciplinary
authority.
6.           Writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid observations.
                                               VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J
