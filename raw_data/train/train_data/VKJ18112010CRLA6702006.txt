: V.K. JAIN, J.
1.             These appeals are directed against the judgment
dated 8th March, 2006 and Order On Sentence dated 13th
March, 2006, whereby all the appellants were convicted
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                             Page 1 of 14

under Section 392 IPC read with Section 397 thereof and the
appellant Rajesh as well as his co-accused Mohd. Nazim were
also convicted under Section 25 of Arms Act. All the
appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment
for 7 years each and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- or to undergo
RI for 6 months each in default under Section 392 read with
Section 397 IPC. The appellant Rajesh was also sentenced to
undergo RI for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- or to
undergo RI for one month in default under Section 25 of
Arms Act.
2.             The case of the prosecution, as disclosed in the FIR
lodged by Shri Kaushal Kishore was that on 28th November,
2000, at about 10.45 P.M., he was waiting at ISBT in order to
take a bus for going to railway station. One auto rickshaw
bearing No. DL 1RC 5704 came up to him. One person was
sitting alongwith the auto rickshaw driver whereas two
persons were sitting on the rear seat of the auto rickshaw.
The boys who were sitting on the rear seat invited him to join
them in the auto rickshaw. On enquiry, the auto rickshaw
driver told him that he would charge Rs.10/- for taking him
to railway station. The complainant thereupon sat on the rear
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                        Page 2 of 14

seat of the auto rickshaw, in between the boys who were
sitting there. The driver took the auto rickshaw via Ring
Road. When the auto rickshaw reached behind Red Fort, one
of the boys sitting on the rear seat, put a knife on his neck,
while the other boy put a knife on his stomach. The boy, who
was sitting with the driver, pressed his mouth with a muffler
and thereupon all of them threatened to kill him, in case he
raised alarm and asked him to handover whatever he had
with him. They removed Rs.1500/- from his pocket, besides
removing the wrist watch, which he was wearing. They also
snatched his briefcase which contained a number of articles,
including one blanket, one shawl, one calculator making
CITIZEN and one camera making YASHICA and Rs.700/-
cash. The auto rickshaw driver then stopped the auto
rickshaw and all of them pushed him out, threatening to kill
him in case he made noise. The complainant took the help of
a police vehicle and lodged a report, which led to registration
of the case.
3.             Appellant No. 2 in Crl.A. 236-237/2006, Shri Anil
Kumar @ Ajju died during pendency of the appeal and the
information regarding his death has been confirmed by the
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                     Page 3 of 14

concerned SHO vide his report dated 5th October, 2009.
4.           During trial, the complainant came in the witness
box as PW-1 and supported the case stated by him in the
FIR. He identified the appellant Lal Singh as the person who
was sitting with the driver and appellant Rajesh as one of the
two persons who were sitting on the rear seat of the auto
rickshaw.        Anil was identified as the driver of the auto
rickshaw. According to him, when the auto rickshaw came
behind Red Fort, the appellant Rajesh kept knife on his neck
whereas Lal Singh pressed his mouth with a muffler and
thereafter those persons asked him to handover whatever he
had in possession or else they would kill him. They removed
Rs. 1500/- besides his wrist watch and briefcase which
contained camera make YASHICA, calculator make CITIZEN
and important documents.          After going a little ahead, Anil
stopped the auto rickshaw and then he was pushed out of the
auto rickshaw.
5.             PW-5 Constable Raj Pal has stated that on 29 th
November, 2000, he alongwith Investigating Officer went to
ISBT in search of the accused persons. At about 3.00 P.M.,
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                        Page 4 of 14

they received a secret information that four persons who were
wanted in this case, were coming from Gandhi Nagar side in
three-wheeler scooter bearing No. 5704. When they stopped
the auto rickshaw, its occupants started running, but were
apprehended. He identified appellant Rajesh and Lal Singh
amongst the person who were apprehended by them and
stated that one knife was recovered from Rajesh and one from
his co-accused Mohd. Nazim. He further stated that accused
Rajesh got recovered one camera from his house whereas Lal
Singh got recovered one suitcase. According to him, Anil also
got recovered one calculator from the rear seat of the auto
rickshaw alongwith a ladies shawl and some cash. Cash was
also seized from Lal Singh. The recovered articles were
identified by the witness during trial.
6.             PW-7 ASI Bhagwan Dass has corroborated the
statement of PW-5 as regards apprehension of the appellants
and recovery from them. PW-8 SI Satpal has corroborated the
deposition of PW-5 Constable Raj Pal regarding arrest of the
appellants and recovery of one buttondar knife Ex. P-3 from
the appellant Rajesh.         PW-10, SI Arvind Pratap Singh, has
also corroborated the deposition of PW-5, Constable Raj Pal,
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                       Page 5 of 14

and PW-7, ASI Bhagwan Das, as regards apprehension of the
appellants and recovery from them.      He has also identified
the articles which were recovered from the appellants, as also
the knife which was recovered from Rajesh.
7.          PW-4 Shri Narender Kumar, Metropolitan Magistrate
has stated that on 2nd December, 2000, all the accused were
produced before him in muffled face. They, however, refused
to join Test Identification Parade (TIP) despite a warning to
them that an adverse inference may be drawn during trial.
The proceedings conducted by him in this regard are Ex.1/B.
He has further stated that on 13 th December, 2000, he also
conducted TIP of the case property and complainant Kaushal
Kishore correctly identified camera, calculator, two pants,
underwear, woolen cap, towel, two shirts, jarsi, one bed
sheet, one pillow cover, two pairs of kurta paijama vide
proceedings Ex.PW-4/D.
8.      In their statement u/s 313 of Cr.P.C., the appellants
denied the allegations against them. They, however, admitted
that they had refused to join test-identification-parade. The
appellant, Rajesh claimed that he refused to join test
identification parade as he did not know the meaning of test
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                    Page 6 of 14

identification parade and he did so at the instance of the
police. The appellant Lal Singh stated that he was shown to
the complainant and witnesses in police station and,
therefore, he refused to join test-identification-parade.
9.      I see no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the
complainant as regards the incident that took place with him
and the identity of the persons involved in commission of
robbery. He had no enmity or ill-will against the appellants
and, therefore, had no reason to implicate them in a false
case of robbery.
10.     Though the appellant Lal Singh claims that he was
shown to the complainant and the witnesses at the police
station, there is no material on record to substantiate the
plea taken by him.            In fact during cross-examination of
complainant, Kamal Kishore, no suggestion was given to him
that the appellant Lal Singh was shown to him in the police
station. The complainant specifically stated that he had not
seen the accused persons prior to giving the statement to the
police and even before coming to the court.              Thus, the
appellant Lal Singh had no justified reason to refuse to join
the test identification parade.         The reason given by the
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                        Page 7 of 14

appellant Rajesh to the Trial Court for refusing to join test-
identification-parade is just meaningless.      A perusal of the
proceedings conducted by PW-4, Sh. Narender Kumar,
Metropolitan Magistrate shows that a specific warning was
given to him that an adverse inference may be drawn against
him on account of his refusal to join it. Despite the warning
he persisted in refusing to join the test-identification-parade.
There is no material on record which may give rise to the
inference that the appellant had refused to join T.I.P. at the
instance of some police officer.        The reason given by the
appellants to the learned Metropolitan Magistrate for refusing
to join T.I.P. was that the police was in possession of their
photographs. There is no material on record to show that the
photographs of the appellants were taken by the police before
they were produced in the court on 2nd December, 2000,
when they refused to join test-identification-parade. In any
case, even if the police had photographs of the appellants in
its custody that has no consequence unless the photographs
were shown to the witness, before the appellants refused to
join T.I.P.      This is not the case of the appellants that their
photographs were shown to the complainant prior to 2nd
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                       Page 8 of 14

December, 2000.              No such suggestion was given to the
complainant, when he came in the witness box.
11.     Since the appellants refused to join T.I.P. without any
justified reason, an adverse inference can be drawn against
them that had they participated in the test-identification-
parade, they would have been identified by the complainant.
If the accused of his own volition declines to join T.I.P.
without reasonable cause, he does so at his own risk and
cannot be heard to say that in the absence of T.I.P., his
identification was not proper.         Similar view was taken in
Suraj Pal Vs. State of Haryana, (1995) 2 SCC 64.
12.     The testimony of the complainant as regards identity of
the appellants also finds corroboration from recovery of the
stolen articles from them.           The deposition of the police
officials shows that one camera was recovered from the
almirah of the house of the appellant Rajesh whereas one
suitcase was recovered from the house of the appellant Lal
Singh.        The suit-case contained a number of articles
including some clothes and bed-sheet. PW-1 Kamal Kishore
has duly identified the camera as well as the clothes which
were recovered from the appellants.            He identified these
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                       Page 9 of 14

articles firstly during judicial T.I.P. and thereafter during
trial.     The appellants do not claim any of these articles.
Therefore, there is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of
the complainant as regards ownership of the articles which
were recovered from the possession of the appellants. In fact
articles such as wearing apparel can be identified by a person
merely by having a look at them as he has been wearing
those articles from time to time. A particular article may be
identified by frequent use which leads to recognition of the
article. In the present case, not only have the articles been
identified during trial, they were also identified during Test-
Identification-Parade conducted by the learned M.M. Since
the appellants were found in possession of stolen articles
soon after the theft, and they have not come forward with any
explanation for these articles being in their possession, it can
be presumed, as provided in Section 114(a) of Evidence Act
that either they had committed theft of these articles or they
had received or retained the same knowing the same to be
stolen property. Since this is not the case of the appellants
that they had received these stolen articles from some other
person, the appropriate presumption should be that they had
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                     Page 10 of 14

committed theft of these articles from the possession of the
complainant.
13.     The testimony of the complainant shows that the
appellant Rajesh kept a knife on his neck and then he was
asked to hand over whatever he was carrying with him.             A
knife was, thus, used in commission of the robbery. Even if a
person simply carries a weapon with him and that weapon is
seen by the victim at the time of the commission of the
robbery that amounts to use of weapon in commission of
robbery. Here, the weapon has been actually used for
threatening the complainant.
14.     In Phool Kumar Vs. Delhi Admn. AIR 1975 SC 905 the
accused was carrying a knife in his hand at the time the
robbery was committed. It was found from the deposition of
PW-16 that the appellant/accused Phool Kumar had a knife
in his hand. The Hon’ble Supreme Court held that he was
therefore carrying a deadly weapon. In Salim Vs. State 1987
(3) Crimes 794 the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi held that to
categorise knife or to fix its size for it to be a deadly weapon
may not be appropriate. It was held that to say that a knife
to be a deadly weapon should be of a particular size would
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                       Page 11 of 14

not be a correct statement.        In State of Maharasthra Vs.
Vinayak 1997 Cr.L.J. 3988 Bombay High Court held that
knife is a deadly weapon within the ambit of expression
‘deadly weapon’ used in section 397 of IPC.             Therefore,
irrespective of the size, any knife is a deadly weapon and
therefore, accused Rajesh is liable to be punished under
Section 392 of IPC read with Section 397 thereof.
15.     However, as far as the appellant Lal Singh is concerned,
admittedly neither he was carrying any weapon nor did he
use the weapon in commission of the offence.             Therefore
Section 397 of IPC does not apply in his case. The testimony
of the complainant, however, shows that the appellant Lal
Singh who was sitting on the front seat alongwith the driver
had pressed his mouth with a muffler and thereafter all of
them including Lal Singh had asked the complainant to hand
over whatever he had with him and then removed cash and
other articles which the complainant was carrying with him
in the auto-rickshaw.         Therefore, it is evident that the
appellant Lal Singh is guilty of commission of robbery, which
is punishable u/s 392 of Indian Penal Code.          It would be
pertinent to note here that Section 397 of the Indian Penal
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                      Page 12 of 14

Code by itself does not create any offence. It only makes the
robbery punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall
not be less than seven years in case a deadly weapon is used
or grievous hurt is caused or an attempt to cause death or
grievous hurt is made.        The substantive offence for which
Section 397 provides minimum punishment is robbery or
dacoity, as the case may be. Therefore, it is not necessary to
award sentence of minimum 7 years to the appellant Lal
Singh.
16.     As regards conviction of the appellant Rajesh u/s 25 of
Arms Act, no arguments were advanced on his behalf. In any
case, the deposition of PW-5 Ct. Raj Pal, PW-8 SI Satpal and
PW-10 SI Arvind Pratap Singh shows that he was found in
possession of a buttondar knife at a public place.          He has
therefore been rightly convicted u/s 25 of the Arms Act.
17.     For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs,
while maintaining conviction of the appellant Rajesh u/s 392
of IPC r/w Section 397 thereof, the conviction of the appellant
Lal Singh is upheld only u/s 392 of IPC without application
of Section 397 thereof. The conviction of the appellant Rajesh
under Section 25 of Arms Act, which otherwise was not
Crl.A.No.236-37 & 670 of 2006                      Page 13 of 14

assailed during arguments is also maintained. The sentence
awarded to the appellant Rajesh does not call for any
interference and is accordingly maintained.      The sentence
awarded to the appellant Lal Singh is, however, reduced to
rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and fine of Rs.1000/-. In
default of payment of fine, he shall undergo SI for three
months. One copy of this judgment be sent to trial court and
one copy be sent to Jail Superintendent for information of the
appellants and for record.
                                              (V.K.JAIN)
