    1.       The appellant filed a suit for infringement of trademark,
             passing off, rendition of accounts etc. against the
             respondents in respect of wheel covers for use in motor
             vehicles and other allied and cognate goods being used
             as      accessories     in    such     motor      vehicles       under       the

             trademark        ‘PRINCE’.         The     appellant       also     filed      an
             application seeking interim relief under Order 39 Rules 1
             and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (‘the said
             Code’ for short).             The claim of the appellant was
             predicated on a registered trade mark since 27.09.2004
             with the allegation that the respondents had come into
             the trade subsequently to tarnish the reputation and
             goodwill of the appellant.            An interim order was granted
             in favour of the appellant on 02.06.2006. However, on
             the respondents moving an application under Order 39
             Rule 4 of the said Code, interim order was modified on a
             statement of the counsel for the appellant that the
             appellant had no objection if the respondents continue
             using their firm name as ‘PRINCE Auto Industries’ but
             they should not use the trademark ‘PRINCE’.                         The said
             two applications for stay and vacation of stay were,
             thereafter, decided in terms of the impugned order dated
             15.10.2009.        The application filed by the appellant under
             Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the said Code was dismissed
             and the interim orders were vacated. The present appeal
             has been preferred against the said order.
    2.       A reading of the plaint filed by the appellant shows that
             the appellant claims continuous, open and extensive use
             of the mark ‘PRINCE’ since April, 2001 with huge sales
             though the mark ‘PRINCE’ is stated to have been
             registered on 27.09.2004 in respect of the accessories

             used in cars included in Class 12.                 The appellant claims
             to have come to know in May, 2006 that the goods of
             respondents were in the market with the identical trade
             mark ‘PRINCE’. Respondents filed their written statement
             and contested the pleas raised by the appellant.                            The
             respondents claimed that R-2 had adopted the trade
             mark/trade name ‘PRINCE Auto Industries’ in the year
             1998 which was much prior to the alleged adoption of the
             trademark ‘PRINCE’ by the appellant in the year 2001.
             The respondents alleged suppression of facts by the
             appellant. The most important suppression is stated to
             be non dis-closure of the fact that the appellant was one
             of the authorized stockiest of R-2 since the year 2001
             and, in fact, subsequently had entered into the written
             agreements dated 19.08.2002 and 20.09.2002 in that
             capacity. The registration of the mark by the appellant is
             alleged to be fraudulent soon after R-2 ceased to have
             any business dealing with the appellant on account of the
             alleged      defaults       in    payments         due      to    R-2.      The
             respondents have filed documents in support of the plea
             including the appellant’s application for registration to
             the     sales    tax    authorities       in    September,         2001         as
             distributor of R-2 which fact is endorsed on the sales tax
             certificate of the appellant.
    3.       In order to arrive at the conclusion, learned Single Judge,
             in our considered view, has rightly framed the question
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
FAO(OS) No.1 of 2010                                                             Page 3 of 8

             as to whether the appellant being a prior user since 1998
             of the business name ‘PRINCE Auto Industries’ with
             emphasis on the mark ‘Prince’ be deprived and divested
             of its rights to use the trademark/trade name ‘PRINCE’
             even though there is a close relationship and nexus
             between the trademark and trade name.                             The other
             aspect which the learned Single Judge has examined
             relates to the allegation of suppression of material facts.
             The factor which has weighed with the learned Single
             Judge is complete suppression in the plaint of the written
             agreements dated 19.08.2002 and 20.09.2002 whereby
             the appellant agreed to be the authorized stockiest of R-
             2. There is neither a whisper of these agreements in the
             plaint nor these documents were filed with the plaint.
    4.       The learned Single Judge thus found the appellant dis-
             entitled to any equitable relief of injunction on account of
             the deliberate suppression of material facts. The factual
             discussion is contained in para 18 of the impugned
             judgment, which is reproduced below:
                     18. The plaintiff, therefore, has disentitled
                     itself to the equitable relief of injunction on
                     account of deliberate suppression of
                     material facts in the plaint as well as
                     suppression of documentary evidence from
                     the scrutiny of this Court. Concealment of
                     material facts or documents deserves to be
                     seriously viewed, for one who comes to the
                     Court owes a duty to the Court to disclose
                     all facts and documents to the Court. The
                     contention of the plaintiff in the instant case
                     that it had disclosed in the plaint that it was
                     purchasing goods from the defendants is
                     neither here nor there.                     The plaintiff
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
FAO(OS) No.1 of 2010                                                             Page 4 of 8

                      deliberately and intentionally, in my view,
                      hid from the Court the fact that the
                      defendant No.2, M/s. PRINCE Auto Industries
                      had been dealing with the same goods, viz.
                      wheel covers and auto accessories and had
                      made a mark in its field of activity well
                      before the plaintiff got registered the
                      trademark 'PRINCE'. The plaintiff also hid
                      from the Court the exact relationship
                      between the plaintiff and the defendants
                      and that there were written agreements to
                      ensure the smooth working of the said
                      relationship duly executed by the parties
                      and      registered         with       the       statutory
                      authorities. The reason for suppression of
                      such material facts is clearly discernible.
                      Had the plaintiff stated in the plaint that the
                      defendant No.2 had been in the same field
                      of activity from the year 1998 under the
                      trade name 'PRINCE Automobile Industries'
                      and had the plaintiff further stated in the
                      plaint that it had been working as the
                      authorised stockist of the plaintiff from the
                      year 2001 to the 15th of September, 2004,
                      the plaintiff, in my view, may not have
                      succeeded in obtaining an ex parte ad
                      interim injunction from this Court, which is
                      enuring to the benefit of the plaintiff till
                      date, though with some modification.
    5.       In our considered view, the learned Single Judge has
             applied the correct approach to the matter in question as
             it is trite to say that a party approaching the Court must
             come       with     clean      hands.       The      non-disclosure             or
             concealment of material facts dis-entitles a party to any
             relief, more so the discretionary relief of injunction. Had
             the relevant fact of prior relationship between the parties
             been disclosed of the appellant working as an authorized
             stockiest of R-2 from 2001 to 15.09.2004, there was little
             chance of obtaining an ex parte injunction.                    It can hardly
             be said that the facts not disclosed were not relevant.

             The knowledge of these facts with the appellant of course
             is not even an issue.
    6.       It is in these circumstances that the reference to the
             judgment of the Supreme Court in S.P.Chengalvaraya
             Naidu (Dead) by LRs. v. Jagananath(Dead) by LRs. and
             Ors; (1994) 1 SCC 1 (=AIR 1994 SC 853) becomes
             relevant and thus any endeavour to withhold a vital
             document in order to gain advantage over the other side
             would amount to a fraud being played on the Court as
             well as on the opposite party.
    7.       We are of the view that this aspect alone is sufficient to
             dis-entitle the appellant to grant of any interim relief.
    8.       The learned Single Judge has proceeded thereafter to
             even analyze the case on merits.
    9.       The use by the appellant of the trade mark/trade name
             ‘PRINCE’ during the currency of the stockiest agreement
             was thus without substance and these aspects are fully
             supported by contemporaneous documents of competent
             authorities       including       sales      tax      department.           The
             documents placed on record by R-2 of almost 70 sample
             copies of its bills of sales show the dealing with third
             parties from the month of April, 1999 while the appellant
             has failed to file any relevant document. Only a few bills
             were placed on record by the appellant relating to the
             mark ‘PRINCE’ and these bills (which are four in number)
             are subsequent to the year 2005. The sale figures of R-2
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
FAO(OS) No.1 of 2010                                                             Page 6 of 8

             have been found to be nearly four times the sales figures
             of the appellant.
    10.      Taking into consideration the nature of the products and
             the emphasis on ‘PRINCE’, the trade name and trade
             style are almost one and the same and are thus closely
             associated in the public mind. The assumption of use of
             trademark ‘PRINCE’ would be that it is manufactured by
             ‘PRINCE Auto Industries’.
    11.      Interestingly, it is not the respondents who approached
             the Court but the appellant filed the suit. Despite having
             obtained registration, the appellant cannot be permitted
             to appropriate the trademark ‘PRINCE’ and prevent its
             rival trader from using the mark in which the rival trader
             ‘respondents’ have prior user.
    12.      We are, in fact, surprised that after such clear and
             undisputed findings about the concealment by the
             appellant, the appellant has still traversed the path of
             filing an appeal.           If one may say, the learned Single
             Judge has been more than considerate in only dismissing
             the interim application and not the suit since in view of
             the observations in S.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) by
             LRs. v. Jagananath(Dead) by LRs. and Ors’ case (supra)
             even the suit could have been thrown out on the ground
             of such concealment of facts. The parties which choose
             to approach the Court with untruths or half-baked truths
             must be dealt with firmly and discouraged from pursuing

             such course of action. The appellant is a prime example
             of this.
    13.      The appeal and the stay application are without merit
             and the same are dismissed with costs quantified at
             Rs.50,000/- to be paid to the respondents within fifteen
             days.
