                                 ORDER
 P.K BHASIN,J:
         This revision petition is at the instance of an employee who is
fighting against his erstwhile employer, respondent no.2 herein, for
getting damages on account of the employer having conducted a
malicious enquiry against him. He is aggrieved by the order dated
27.11.2010 passed by the trial Court whereby his application under
Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC in short) for
enlargement of time in making the payment of costs of adjournment
imposed on him 09/02/04 has been dismissed.
 C.R.P. 200/2010                                              Page 1 of 6

2.       The petitioner-plaintiff had filed a suit for damages against the
respondents for defaming him by holding a malicious domestic enquiry
against him. On 07-01-2004, when the case was fixed for cross-
examination of defendants’ witness(DW-1) the petitioner-plaintiff had
sought an adjournment because of non-availability of his counsel. The
learned trial Judge granted the adjournment but subject to payment of
costs of Rs.5,000/-. The case was adjourned to 09.02.2004. The costs
were not paid on the adjourned date but no adverse order was passed
on that date of hearing and thereafter on some ground or the other the
trial was adjourned on many dates and finally on 27.03.05 the suit
came to be dismissed by the trial Court by invoking Section 35-B CPC.
Challenge to that order of dismissal of the suit before this Court failed
and then petitioner-plaintiff approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court
where he succeeded in getting an order for the revival of his suit. It
was held by the Supreme Court in its order dated 13.12.2009 passed (in
civil appeal no. 7554 - 7555 of 2009) that the suit could not be
dismissed for non-payment of costs under Section 35B CPC. While
disposing of the appeal the Hon’ble Supreme Court had observed in
para no.6 of its order as under :-
       “ 6. We may also refer to an incidental issue. When section 35B
         states that payment of such costs on the date next following the date
         of the order shall be a condition precedent for further prosecution,
         it clearly indicates that when the costs are levied, it should be paid
         on the next date of hearing and if it is not paid, the consequences
         mentioned therein shall follow. But the said provision will not
         come in the way of the court, in its discretion extending the time for
         such payment , in exercise of its general power to extend the time
         under section 148 of CPC. Having regard to the scheme and
         object of section 35B, it is needless to say that such extension can
 C.R.P. 200/2010                                                       Page 2 of 6

         be only in exceptional circumstances and by subjecting the
         defaulting party to the further terms. No party can routinely be
         given extension of time for payment of costs, having regard to the
         fact that such costs under section 35B were itself levied for causing
         delay.”
Then after observing in para no.9 the plaintiff had harassed the
defendant and its witnesses in the concluding para no. 10 it was
held as under:-
         “ 10. (i) The right of the plaintiff to cross –examine DW-2 stands
         forfeited and he is barred from prosecuting the suit further.
                   (ii) The trial court shall however permit the defendants to
         let in any further evidence ,hear arguments and then dispose of the
         suit.
                (iii) However, if plaintiff-appellant tenders the costs with an
         appropriate application under section 148 CPC, the trial Court
         may consider his request in accordance with law. Even if the
         Court extends the time for deposit, permits the plaintiff to pay the
         costs and prosecute the suit further, that will not entitle the
         plaintiff to cross-examine DW2.”
3.       Thereafter, the petitioner-plaintiff filed an application under
section 148 CPC in the trial Court on 24-12-2009 and the same was
ordered to be listed on 18.01.2010. On that date the petitioner-plaintiff
had brought to the Court the cheque for Rs.5,000/- which was kept on
record by the trial Judge for being given to the other side. Then notice
of that application was given to the defendants, respondents herein, and
after considering their objections that application was dismissed by the
trial Court vide order dated 27.11.10 which has given rise to this
revision petition.
 C.R.P. 200/2010                                                        Page 3 of 6

4.        The learned trial Court noticed the pleas raised in opposition to
that application on behalf of the respondents-defendants in para no.10
of the impugned order and the relevant part therefrom is re-produced
below:-
         “10…………………… It is submitted by ld. Counsel for the
         defendants/non-applicants that at the most only thirty days could
         be enlarged as a matter of time for the plaintiff to deposit the cost
         or to do any act as per the directions of this court. It is further
         submitted by ld. counsel for the defendants that thirty days should
         be counted from the date of order dated 09.02.2004 when it was
         directed to the plaintiff to deposit the cost up to 09.03.2004.
         Thereafter, on 01.04.2005 my ld. Predecessor again directed to
         deposit the cost. However, the plaintiff did not deposit the cost.
         On 27.4.2005, an application for waiver of cost was moved and the
         said application was also dismissed. It is further submitted by ld.
         Counsel for the defendants that the time should be counted from
         27.4.2005. However, he further submits that for the sake of
         interest of justice, though not admitted let time may be counted
         from 13.11.2009 i.e. from the date of order passed by the Hon'ble
         Supreme Court of India then also the cost has also not been
         deposited within thirty days as the cheque was given of dated
         18.1.2010. He further submits that at the most from the date of
         order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, cost should
         be deposited up to 13.12.2009. It is further submitted by ld.
         counsel for the defendants that the cheque is also not a valid
         tender of the cost and cost should either be deposited by pay order
         or to be paid in cash. In these circumstances, he further submits
         that this application may be dismissed.”
5.       In para no.11 of the impugned order the learned trial Court noted
the submission made by the petitioner-plaintiff and that para is also re-
produced below:-
            “11. On the other hand, it is stated by the plaintiff that after the
         receipt of the certified copy from the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
         India, he moved this application and also deposited the cost.”
 C.R.P. 200/2010                                                        Page 4 of 6

6.       Then in the concluding para no.12 of the impugned order the
learned trial Court observed as under:-
              12. “This court does not agree with the contentions made by
         the plaintiff. It is not the case of the plaintiff that when the
         Hon’ble Supreme Court of India passed the order, he was not
         present . The plaintiff was very well aware about the contents of
         the order. Moreover, the contention of the appellant is itself false
         as the noting upon the certified copy is of 4.12.2009 when the
         certified copy was ready and even if thirty days is to be continued
         from 14.12.2009 then also those thirty days expired on 13.1.2009.
         Thus, the contentions raised by the applicant in the application do
         not inspire the confidence. Therefore, this application of the
         plaintiff is dismissed”
7.       The petitioner argued that since the application under Section
148 CPC had been moved by him pursuant to the liberty granted to
him by the Supreme Court the same could not have been dismissed on
the ground that it had been filed after the expiry of 30 days from the
date of the order of the Supreme Court. I am in full agreement with
this submission of the petitioner. Since the Supreme Court had not
fixed any time for the petitioner for moving the application under
Section 148 CPC the same could not have been dismissed on the
ground that it had been filed after 30 days from the date of the order
passed by the Supreme Court in the petitioner’s appeal. However, as
far as the final order of the learned trial Court dismissing the
petitioner’s application is concerned I am not inclined to interfere with
the same for the reason that no reason whatsoever had been given by
the petitioner – plaintiff in his application under Section 148 CPC
justifying the relief sought for by him in that application. As noticed
 C.R.P. 200/2010                                                     Page 5 of 6

already, in the petitioner’s appeal itself the Hon'ble Supreme Court had
clearly observed that the Court should grant enlargement of time, as
provided under Section 148 CPC, only in exceptional cases keeping in
view the scheme and object of section 35-B CPC.           Therefore, in the
absence of any reason having been given by the petitioner – plaintiff in
his application under Section 148 CPC for the relief sought for and he
having simply narrated the facts leading to the filing of the appeal
before the Supreme Court and passing of the order giving him the
liberty to move an application under Section 148 CPC I am not
inclined to interfere with the order of the learned trial Court dismissing
that application.
8.       This revision petition is, therefore, dismissed.
