      CORAM:
      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE I.S.MEHTA
                                   ORDER
      I.S. MEHTA, J.
         1.        By way of the above captioned applications, i.e. BAIL
            APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017, the present
            petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra Jain and (2) Surendra Kumar Jain,
            seek regular bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. in the case
            ECIR/01/DLZO-II/2017 dated 11.02.2017, under Sections 3 &
            4 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (herein after
            referred to as PMLA).
         2.        The brief facts stated are that vide order dated 28.10.2013
            the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ordered an investigation by
            the Serious Fraud Investigation Officer (SFIO) into the affairs
            of various companies. Pursuant to that an investigation was
            conducted by the SFIO and on 31.03.2016 an investigation
            report under Section 241 of the Companies Act, 1956 was filled.
            Thereafter, on the basis of the aforesaid investigation report, on
            29.11.2016 a Criminal Complaint No. 57463 of 2016 was filed
            by the SFIO against various accused persons (including the
            petitioners herein) for violation of the provisions under Sections
            233/628 read with 211/240 (3) of the Companies Act and under
            Sections 420/468/477-A/120-B IPC before the Court of learned
            Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (Central) Special
            Acts, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi.
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 2 of 34

         3.        Subsequently, on 11.02.2017 the respondent/department
            on the basis of the aforesaid complaint registered a case
            ECIR/01/DLZO-II/2017, under Sections 3 & 4 of Prevention of
            Money Laundering Act, 2002 against the accused persons
            (including the petitioners herein). It is alleged in the said
            complaint that during the period of 2004 to 2010 the accused
            persons/petitioners entered into a criminal conspiracy for the
            object of providing accommodation entries to the various
            beneficiary companies with an aim of converting their
            unaccounted money through legitimate transactions by charging
            commission with the assistance of mediators and in this process
            companies and firms were used as special purpose vehicle for
            camouflaging the laundering. Further, the Income Tax Officer
            vide assessment order dated 28.03.2013 has recorded a finding
            that M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. had laundering its unaccounted
            income through a set of companies controlled by the
            accused/petitioners in the guise of share subscription money at a
            huge premium to the tune of Rs. 64.70 Crore during the
            financial year 2008-09, with the help of a professional
            Chartered Accountant Rajesh Aggarwal. The entire share
            subscription of Rs. 64.70 Crore has been held to be unexplained
            cash credit under Section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in the
            hands of M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. for the assessment year 2009-
            10 and the commission payment of Rs. 1,16,46,000/- @ 1.80%
            on the total accommodation entries of Rs. 64.70 Crore made to
            the accused/petitioners for securing accommodation entries has
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 3 of 34

            been an unexplained expenses incurred during the assessment
            year 2009-10. It was further alleged that the accused/petitioners
            dishonestly and fraudulently inflated the balance sheet of the
            companies by fictitiously increasing its share capital and
            investment through rotation of cheques in the bank accounts
            while in fact actual value of investment in the group companies
            was nil. Thus, the accused/petitioners dishonestly and
            fraudulently made false balance sheets and thereby committed
            the forgery for the purpose of cheating, i.e. offences punishable
            under Sections 120-B/420 IPC which are Schedule Offences of
            Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.
         4.        On 13.02.2017 Seizure Memo/Panchnama was prepared
            by the officers of the respondent/department and thereafter,
            summons dated 01.03.2017, 03.03.2017 and 16.03.2017 were
            issued to the petitioner- Virendra Jain and summons dated
            13.02.2017, 14.02.2017, 27.02.2017, 03.03.2017, 15.03.2017
            and 16.03.2017 were issued to the petitioner- Surendra Kumar
            Jain for their appearance before the Assistant Director of the
            respondent/department to give statements under Section 50 of
            the PMLA.
         5.        Consequently, on 20.03.2017 the petitioners were
            arrested by the officers of the respondent/department. In the
            meanwhile the petitioners moved bail application before the
            Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts, New
            Delhi and vide order dated 02.05.2017 the learned ASJ
            dismissed the bail application of the petitioners.
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 4 of 34

         6.        Thereafter, on 18.05.2017 the respondent/department
            through its Assistant Director filed a complaint under Section
            45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 for
            commission of offences of money laundering as defined under
            Section 3 and punishable under Section 4 of Prevention of
            Money Laundering Act, 2002 against the petitioners.
         7.        The present petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra Jain and (2)
            Surendra Kumar Jain, have filed the present applications
            assailing various actions taken by the respondent/department in
            arresting the petitioners and calling them to appear before them
            without following the mandate of law as well as procedure
            established by law in violation of their Fundamental Rights as
            guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
         8.        The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
            petitioners submits that the matter, inter alia, originated from an
            Income Tax raid conducted on 14.09.2010 leading to passing of
            an Assessment Order dated 28.03.2013 by the Income Tax
            Assessing Officer. The Assessment Order was challenged
            before the CIT (Appeals) and subsequently before the Income
            Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal had remanded back the
            entire matter while observing that there was violation of
            principles of natural justice and petitioners should be given
            adequate      opportunity      and      confronted      with       all
            material/evidence/statements.
         9.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
            submitted that the entire case is based upon certain documents
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                     Page 5 of 34

             which are all a matter of record. He has further submitted that it
             is a complex analysis of transactions and the petitioners may
             well have a case to dislodge the entire accusations set up against
             them.
         10.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that in response to the Summons issued by the
             respondent/Enforcement Directorate, petitioners had duly
             appeared and co-operated on several occasions. He has further
             submitted that the arrest of the petitioners, therefore, is grossly
             actuated with malice and is in violation of the spirit of Section
             19 of PMLA which contemplates three necessary pre-requisites
             before effecting arrest viz. material in possession; reasons to
             believe in writing to be recorded in writing & reasons to believe
             that the person sought to be arrested is guilty of money
             laundering. He has further submitted that such pre-requisites
             have not been fulfilled and the petitioners’ liberty has been
             invaded merely on whims, fancies, prejudices and beliefs.
         11.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that it is an undisputed fact that no PMLA
             proceedings can come into existence unless there is a Scheduled
             Offence wherefrom any ‘proceeds of crime’ are derived or
             obtained and are projected as untainted. He has submitted that
             in the instant case, the Scheduled Offence is a complaint filed
             by SFIO against the petitioners on 29.11.2016, inter alia,
             invoking Sections 420/120-B IPC, however, no cognizance had
             been taken by any Court when the ECIR was registered. He has
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 6 of 34

             further submitted that even on the date of filing of Prosecution
             Complaint, no cognizance was taken in the Scheduled Offence
             by any competent Court and in these circumstances, entire
             proceedings are without any foundation inasmuch as it is a sine
             qua non that the trial in both the cases have to go
             simultaneously in terms of Section 44 of PMLA. Therefore, law
             does not contemplate even initiation of proceedings under
             PMLA without the Scheduled Offence being in existence. He
             has further submitted that mere filing of a complaint does not
             necessarily lead to an inference that either a cognizance has
             been taken or the offence has seen the light of the day as
             understood in ordinary legal parlance.
         12.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that since the prosecution complaint stands filed, no
             useful purpose would be served by further incarceration of the
             petitioners in custody and they would be deprived of contesting
             their following cases:-
                a) Proceedings before the Income Tax Authority pursuant to
                    the remand ordered by the CIT Appeals, wherein, the
                    directions have been issued that petitioners should be
                    given adequate opportunity and confronted with all
                    material/evidence/statements;
                b) Contest the present case before the Trial Court, wherein,
                    Prosecution Complaint has since been filed;
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 7 of 34

                c) Proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority in seisin
                    of complaint filed by the respondent under Section 5(5)
                    PMLA for attachment of their immovable property.
         13.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that petitioners’ conduct in cooperating with the
             investigation is undisputed and they have deep roots in society
             and the question of their absconding or evading the process of
             law does not even remotely arise.
         14.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that in any event, the twin limitations contained in
             Section 45(1) PMLA do not get attracted to the case of the
             petitioners. He has further submitted that the Scheduled
             Offences in the present case as mentioned is the complaint filed
             by SFIO against the petitioners on 29.11.2016, inter alia,
             invoking Sections 420/120-B IPC. It is an undisputed fact that
             these offences came to be incorporated by way of an
             amendment into the PMLA in the year 2009 that too in Part B
             of the Schedule thereto. Indubitably, the twin limitations for
             grant of bail contained in Section 45 PMLA only bring within
             their fold the offences under Part A of the Schedule that too
             punishable for more than three years. Insofar as offences under
             Part B of the Schedule are concerned, the initiation under
             PMLA could take place only if the total value involved therein
             was more than Rs.30 lacs. Therefore, with an object to remove
             the said monetary threshold, an amendment was carried out in
             2013, whereby all offences under Part B of the Schedule were
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 8 of 34

             inserted in Part A. There was no legislative intent to invoke the
             limitations qua bail to such offences.
         15.        In support of his submissions, the learned senior counsel
             for the petitioners has relied upon the judgment in case Gorav
             Kathuria vs. Union of India; 2016 SCC OnLine P&H 3428.
         16.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that the petitioners, i.e. Virendra Jain and Surendera
             Kumar Jain, are the brothers. He has submitted that the
             petitioners are in custody since 20.03.2017 and the prosecution
             complaint has already been filed on 18.05.2017. It is further
             submitted that prior to their arrest, the petitioners were
             associated with investigation on several occasions and they
             rendered full cooperation. The case originates from an Income
             Tax Raid conducted at the residential and business premises of
             the petitioners on 14.09.2010 and assessment order was passed
             against    the  petitioners   and    their appeals   before     the
             Commissioner of Income Tax were also dismissed. However,
             the Income Tax appellate tribunal on 03.02.2016 had set aside
             the orders passed by the assessing authority and the appellate
             authority and the matter is now remanded back for a fresh
             consideration. The petitioners had filed a petition for
             amalgamation of the two companies before this Hon’ble Court
             and in those proceedings a report was submitted by the
             Registrar of Companies who had stated that there were certain
             anomalies in the functioning of the companies. The Ministry of
             Corporate Affairs thereafter initiated an investigation by SFIO
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 9 of 34

            under Section 241 of the Companies Act on 28.10.2013. The
            SFIO submitted investigation report to the Ministry of
            Corporate Affairs on 31.03.2016 and thereafter on 30.05.2016
            the Ministry of Corporate Affairs granted sanction directing the
            SFIO to file a criminal complaint against the petitioners. On
            29.11.2016 criminal complaint against 31 accused persons
            including the petitioners were filed under Sections 233/628 read
            with 211 and 240 (3) of the Companies Act, 1956 and Sections
            420/468/477-A/120-B       IPC    and  that   criminal   complaint
            remained pending and no cognizance was taken by the
            concerned Metropolitan Magistrate till 6th June, 2017. Without
            cognizance having been taken in the criminal complaint on 11 th
            February, 2017, the present respondent/complainant lodged an
            ECIR for offences under Sections 3/4 of PMLA relying on the
            said criminal complaint as the schedule offence. On 13.02.2017
            search was conducted by the respondent/department in the
            petitioners residential premises and thereafter the petitioners
            were summoned to appear on various occasions and the
            petitioners complied with those summons. The petitioners have
            no objection to retention thereafter and the said application was
            allowed by the adjudicating authority on 29.05.2017.           The
            respondent/complainant has also initiated attachment of
            immovable property of the petitioners by filing a complaint
            under Section 5 (5) of PMLA before the adjudicating authority
            and that matter is pending adjudication. In the meanwhile, they
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 10 of 34

             filed a prosecution complaint on 18.05.2017 and the matter is
             now pending trial.
         17.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that the entire case is based upon the documents
             which are subject matter of criminal complaint filed by SFIO
             and this would be entirely a matter of trial whether the
             petitioners are guilty of accusations. The conduct of the
             petitioners is above bar and they have rendered all due
             cooperation to all the investigating agencies including the SFIO
             and that no ECIR could legitimately registered prior to the
             cognizance having been taken by the concerned court in the
             schedule offence.      The proceeds of crime are seriously
             debatable issue and the respondent/complainant is only relying
             on the personal complaint filed by SFIO. The proceedings
             before the Income Tax Authority pursuant to direction are
             pending and petitioners would be deprived of the contest to
             those proceedings as well as the adjudication proceedings
             relating to attachment of immovable property as also their
             defence in both the criminal case in the present trial. The twin
             limitations contained in Section 45 (1) of PMLA are not
             attracted to the case of the petitioners because the schedule
             offence have been added in Part-A of the schedule by way of an
             amendment in 2013 and earlier they were in Part-B.             The
             amendment was brought in only to remove the monetary
             threshold of Rs. 30 lacs and not to apply the twin limitations
             contained in Section 45 of PMLA. This issue has been raised
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 11 of 34

             by a Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in
             Gorav Kathuria (supra) wherein it was held that the schedule
             offence contained in Part-B prior to amendment in 2013, the
             twin limitations of Section 45 of PMLA would not apply. While
             disposing of the said case the Division Bench of Punjab and
             Haryana High Court had issued a certificate of appeal under
             Article 134 of the Constitution of India and an appeal was filed
             before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.          The Hon’ble Supreme
             Court vide order dated 12.08.2016 while dismissing the said
             appeal clearly held that the judgment of the High Court is
             correct. Therefore, the issue of applicability of twin limitations
             now stands accorded approval by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,
             even if the applicability of twin limitations under Section 45 of
             PMLA are presumed to be applicable. There is no bar to grant
             bail as it is only a reasonable satisfaction that this Court is
             required to accord as to whether a case for bail is made out or
             not. In this context, the reliance is placed on the judgment of
             the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case Ranjitsing Brahmjeetsing
             Sharma vs. State of Maharashtra And Another; 2005 5 SCC
             294 and two judgments of Bombay High Court in Anil Babulal
             Chokhra vs. Directorate of Enforcement, Mumbai & Anr.;
             Bail Appl. No. 1581/2017 dated 04.08.2017 as well in Kailash
             Aggarwal vs. The Enforcement Directorate Mumbai & Anr.;
             Bail Appl. No. 174/2017 dated 28.02.2017.
         18.        The learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further
             submitted that Gorav Kathuria (supra) is a definite law laid
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 12 of 34

             down under Article 141 of the Constitution of India by Hon’ble
             Supreme Court. Specific reliance is made to paras 9 & 10 of the
             said judgment to argue that Union of India as well as the
             Enforcement Directorate were parties before the High Court and
             they had duly addressed their arguments. In paras 31, 36, 37 &
             38 of the said judgment, definite law was laid down that twin
             limitations under Section 45 of PMLA would not apply to Part-
             B offence prior to the amendment of 2013. In para 72 of the
             aforesaid judgment, Gautam Kundu vs. Directorate of
             Enforcement       (Prevention    of   Money-Laundering       Act),
             Government of India; (2015) 16 SCC 1 case has also been
             considered by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. In para
             80 of the said judgment, the High Court issued a certificate of
             appeal which clearly stated that there is no other judgment
             passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on this aspect.           The
             Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 12.08.2016 clearly
             held that the view of the High Court is correct. Reliance is
             placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
             V.M.Salgaocar & Bros. Pvt. Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income
             Tax; (2000) 5 SCC 373 to show that once an appeal is
             dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court it amounts to the
             doctrine of merger applies and the judgment of the High Court
             gets merged into that of the Supreme Court which is a binding
             precedent.
         19.        It is further submitted that Gautam Kundu (supra) had no
             occasion to deal with the question as to whether post
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 13 of 34

             amendment of 2013 the erstwhile Part-B offences which have
             now been merged into Part-A would still attract the rigours of
             Section 45 of PMLA. A judgment of the Court cannot be read
             as an arithmetical and mathematical theorem and it must be read
             in the context of the lis. The reliance placed by other side on
             the view taken by Karnataka High Court and Gujarat High
             Court that Gorav Kathuria (supra) is not a binding precedent are
             per-inquirium. Thus, High Courts have not considered the ratio
             of law laid down in V.M.Salgaocar (supra). In any event in a
             recent pronouncement later than those High Courts the Madras
             High Court in J.Sekar vs. Assistant Director, Directorate of
             Enforcement, Chennai Zonal Office; Criminal Original
             Petition Nos. 7146/2017 dated 12.05.2017 has clearly held that
             doctrine of merger applies and in view of Gorav Kathuria
             (supra) twin limitations of Section 45 of PMLA will not apply.
             Regarding      merits,     it    is   submitted      that      the
             respondent/Enforcement Directorate has indulged in a gross
             abuse of the process of law.
         20.        It is further submitted that as per accusations the
             petitioners have received commission to the tune of about Rs.
             1,11,00,000/- for the purpose of converting unaccounted money
             of Rs. 62.20 crore pertaining to M/s Jagat Projects Limited.
             There is absolutely no offence that unaccounted cash was either
             found from the premises of the petitioners through the raids
             conducted by Income Tax Department, SFIO or the
             respondent/Enforcement Directorate. The companies of the
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 14 of 34

             petitioners which have invested into the shares of M/s Jagat
             Projects Limited, no cash transaction has been made therein. At
             the relevant time when the shares were purchased there was no
             bar under the Companies Act for the payment of any premium.
             All this matter is sub-judice before various forums and it will be
             a matter of adjudication as to whether the petitioners have
             actually received the amount of Rs. 1,11,00,000/- as
             commission. The case of the petitioners is that this amount was
             received in their accounts for the profit of their investment. The
             investigations were yet pending and even the prosecution had
             not been lodged. The primary reason for rejection was the non-
             placement of 6000 pages of the record of SFIO. The allegation
             of tempering is not borne out at all since the entire case is based
             upon documents which are already in their possession.            The
             maximum punishment envisaged under the Act is 7 years and
             the petitioners have bed ridden mother, who is about 80 years
             old and suffering from blood cancer and other related ailments.
             No ESIR could have been registered without taking cognizance
             in the schedule offence by the concerned Court as it would
             amount       to     usurping     of     jurisdiction     by       the
             respondent/Enforcement Directorate when none exists. The
             PMLA clearly contemplates existence of a schedule offence
             prior to invocation of the proceedings therein.
         21.        On the other hand, learned ASG Mr. Sanjay Jain has
             submitted that in the light of the investigation conducted so far,
             it is clearly established that petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra Jain
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                     Page 15 of 34

             and (2) Surendra Kumar Jain (Jain Brothers), are involved in the
             activities of laundering of money for clients having unaccounted
             cash with the help of a group of companies providing the
             facility of placement of unaccounted cash, layering of
             transactions and integration of the layered money into the books
             of the owners of unaccounted cash in the guise of fresh share
             subscription at a premium. He has further submitted that the
             original owners of unaccounted funds regain control over their
             entities by subsequent transfer of shares at a drastically
             discounted price in the names of close relatives/associates of the
             promoters/directors. He has further submitted that the full cycle
             of activities is clearly visible in the case of companies
             controlled by Jain Brothers (petitioners herein) and M/s Jagat
             Projects Ltd. with the mediation of Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered
             Accountant.
         22.        The learned ASG has further submitted that M/s Jagat
             Projects Ltd, have converted its unaccounted money to the tune
             of Rs. 64.70 Crore into apparently legitimate transactions by
             way of share subscription by various companies. He has further
             submitted that this illegal activity related to the scheduled
             offence have generated property involved in money laundering
             to the extent of Rs. 64.70 Crore which was further invested by
             M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. into their sister concern M/s Divine
             Infracon Pvt. Ltd. for construction of Hotel, (now managed by
             Radisson Blu) at Plot No. 4, Sector-13, Dwarka, New Delhi.
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 16 of 34

         23.        The learned ASG has further submitted that Jain Brothers
             have received funds of Rs. 62.20 Crore in advance from M/s
             Jagat Projects Ltd. through Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered
             Accountant and placed the funds, pertaining to M/s Jagat
             Projects Ltd., from the accounts of various firms into the
             account of M/s Tulika Securities Pvt. Ltd. for layering and then
             these funds were transferred to 26 companies for final
             investment into M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. He has further
             submitted that for the entire process of receiving funds
             pertaining to M/s Jagat Projects Ltd., in the accounts of various
             firms and from there into the account of M/s Tulika Securities
             Pvt. Ltd. for layering and then transferring to the accounts of
             their 26 companies for final investment into M/s Jagat Projects
             Ltd., the petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra Jain and (2) Surendra
             Kumar Jain (Jain Brothers), have received commission to the
             tune of Rs. 1,11,96,000/- through their companies for
             converting unaccounted money of Rs. 62.20 Crore belonging to
             M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. into their share capital/premium. So the
             amount of Rs. 1,11,96,000/- received as commission is the
             proceeds of crime of Jain Brothers. He has further submitted
             that the proceeds of crime are inseparable between both brothers
             (petitioners herein) as they were involved in the accommodation
             entry business and were maintaining documents and records
             unitedly.
         24.        The learned ASG has further submitted that from the
             statements of petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra Jain and (2) Surendra
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 17 of 34

            Kumar Jain, and other evidences collected during investigation,
            it is established that Surendera Kumar Jain and Virendera Jain
            and the companies/firms controlled and managed by Surendera
            Kumar Jain and Virendera Jain (Jain Brothers) were involved in
            the offence of money laundering punishable under Section 4 of
            PMLA ibid. He has further submitted that investigation has
            revealed that the modus operandi of Jain brother was to launder
            the unaccounted money through the companies controlled and
            managed by them by process of placement of funds, layering of
            transactions and the final integration of laundered money into
            the banking channel camouflaged as legitimate share premium
            transactions. He has further submitted that funds were brought
            in by the mediators on behalf of the beneficiaries. The Jain
            Brothers (petitioners herein) were providing accommodation
            entries by accepting funds from their beneficiaries through
            mediators and converting the same into share premium
            transactions in the beneficiary company. In this process Jain
            Brother earned money as a certain percentage of the
            unaccounted money converted into share premium. Jain
            brothers have received funds of Rs. 62.20 Crore in advance
            from M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. through Rajesh Aggarwal,
            Chartered Accountant and placed the funds, pertaining to M/s
            Jagat Projects Ltd., from the accounts of various firms into the
            account of M/s Tulika Securities Pvt. Ltd., for layering and then
            theses funds were transferred to 26 companies for final
            investment into M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. For the entire process of
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 18 of 34

             receiving funds pertaining to M/s Jagat Projects Ltd., in the
             accounts of various firms and from there into the account of M/s
             Tulika Securities Pvt. Ltd. for layering and then transferring to
             the accounts of their 26 companies for final investment into M/s
             Jagat Projects Ltd. the petitioners have received commission to
             the tune of Rs.1,11,96,000/- through their companies for
             converting unaccounted money of Rs. 62.20 Crore belonging to
             M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. into their share capital/premium. Thus,
             the petitioners have directly attempted to indulge and knowingly
             assisted an actually involved in the process of concealment,
             possession, acquisitions, use and projecting it as untainted
             property, and thereby they have committed an offence of money
             laundering.
         25.        The learned ASG on behalf of the respondent has
             submitted that at the very outset it becomes essential in the
             context of this matter to appreciate the parameters of grant or
             refusal of bail as envisaged under Section 45 of PMLA, 2002.
             It is noteworthy that Section 45 of PMLA entails with rigours
             before another decision is taken as to grant or refusal of bail.
             Rigours are that before a person can be considered to be
             released on bail.       Public prosecutor has to be given an
             opportunity to oppose the application and if public prosecutor
             opposes the application then the Court will have to be satisfied
             that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the
             petitioner is not guilty of the offence of Money Laundering and
             that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. We
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 19 of 34

             would submit that the ordinary law pertaining to grant or refusal
             of bail or as canvassed by learned counsel for the petitioners
             that only reasonable satisfaction is required, could not be the
             correct law to be applied in PMLA case. The learned counsel
             for the petitioners has urged that mainly because the provisions
             which constitute the Scheduled Offence have been migrated to
             Part-A only in 2013 and, therefore, the twin rigours would not
             apply because the offending act on behalf of the petitioners as
             per the case of the respondent/department had commenced prior
             to 2013 is also incorrect.
         26.        In this regard, the respondent/department would like to
             rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case
             Gautam Kundu vs. Directorate of Enforcement (Prevention of
             Money-Laundering Act), Government of India; (2015) 16
             SCC 1. In the said judgment it was held by Hon’ble Supreme
             Court as regards the twin rigours of Section 45 of PMLA, that
             while there is no doubt that the conditions laid down under
             Section 45 of PMLA would bind the High Court as the
             provisions of special law having overriding effect on the
             provisions of Section 439 Cr.PC for grant of bail to any person
             accused of committing an offence under Section 4 of the
             PMLA. The said observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court
             was followed in a subsequent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
             Court in Crl.A.No. 1223/2017 titled Union of India vs.
             Varinder Singh @ Raja & Anr. dated 21.07.2017 in which it
             has been held that when complying with a requirement of
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 20 of 34

             Section 45 of PMLA, the High Court should not have granted
             the bail. By this order the Hon’ble Supreme Court had set aside
             the order of granting the bail passed by the High Court. The
             respondent/Department would also placed reliance on a
             judgment of a High Court of Karnataka passed in S.C.
             Jayachandra      vs.   Enforcement     Directorate,   Banglore;
             MANU/KA/0456/2017.
         27.        The Karnataka High Court discussed in detail as to
             whether the judgment of Punjab and Haryana High Court in
             Gorav Kathuria (supra) would be constituted as having binding
             effect within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution of
             India. After considering several judgments on this aspect, the
             Court came to the conclusion in para 30 of the judgment that
             Gorav Kathuria (supra) case cannot be treated as a binding
             precedent and further held that the pronouncement in Gautam
             Kundu (supra) was still the good law, so far as the question
             regarding limitations prescribed in Section 45 (1) of PMLA are
             concerned, in the said judgment, it has also been noticed that in
             Gorav Kathuria (supra), Union of India was neither present and
             hence could not be heard and more so, said judgment could not
             be taken as a binding precedent because the judgment itself was
             contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
             Gautam Kundu (supra).        The respondent/department would
             further urge that the above view of the Karnataka High Court
             has been followed by several other High Courts as would be
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 21 of 34

             clear from the judgment of Pradeep Nirankarnath Sharma vs.
             Directorate of Enforcement; MANU/GJ/1110/2017.
         28.        It is, therefore, clear from the conjoint reading of the
             above judgment that listing of the schedule offence in Part-A by
             virtue of amendment in 2013 is not at all the relevant factor for
             deciding a bail application under Section 45 of PMLA and does
             not in any manner dilute or eclipse the twin rigours of Section
             45 of PMLA which expect the Court considering the bail
             application to come to a satisfaction to the fact that there are
             reasonable grounds for believing that the petitioners are not
             guilty of offence of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and
             that they are not likely to commit any offence while on bail. The
             respondent/department would like to draw the kind attention of
             this Court on the seriousness and gravity of the offence as
             apparently is made out in the facts of the case.              The
             respondent/department would like to draw the kind attention of
             this Court to the counter affidavit filed by it in which the
             relevant facts have been set out, particularly as regards the
             investigation conducted by SFIO.
         29.        The learned ASG has further submitted that there is a
             company of M/s Jagat Projects Limited which wanted
             accommodation entries. The unaccounted money of M/s Jagat
             Projects Limited was diverted to a mediator called Rajesh
             Aggarwal, Chartered Accountant for placement of the same
             through other companies. The said Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered
             Accountant placed the unaccounted money of M/s Jagat
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 22 of 34

             Projects Limited through the companies managed and
             controlled by the petitioners. This was a method of layer. The
             unaccounted money of M/s Jagat Projects Limited pursuant to
             which the companies held and controlled by the petitioners
             made investment in M/s Jagat Projects Limited by purchasing
             their shares at Rs. 10/- per share at the high share premium of
             Rs. 400/- per share. In this manner, the unaccounted money of
             M/s Jagat Projects Limited challenges through Rajesh
             Aggarwal, Chartered Accountant and then the petitioners were
             brought back into the accounts of M/s Jagat Projects Limited in
             a laundered firm. Thus it is a most blatant case of Money
             Laundering.       It  is  in   these   circumstances    that    the
             respondent/Enforcement Directorate had          commenced the
             investigation under PMLA and having found unimpeachable
             material in the course of its investigation, eventually instituted
             the statutory complaint before the Special Court. The
             cognizance has already been taken in respect of PMLA
             complaint on 03.07.2017. In fact a bail application was filed
             before the Special Court also, which has been dismissed with a
             detailed reasoning vide order dated 02.05.2017.
         30.        It is further submitted that there is no change of
             circumstances. Since the time the bail was refused and in fact
             the special court had all the material available to it while
             adjudicating upon the said bail applications. As regards the
             argument of the ECIR wrongly been initiated for the reason that
             on 11.02.2017, the Court had not taken cognizance on the
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 23 of 34

             complaint filed by SFIO under the schedule offence the same is
             also incorrect because there is no requirement in law that for
             initiating an inquiry or investigation under PMLA the Court
             should have taken cognizance of the schedule offence. It is
             clear from the reading of the Section 19 of the Act that the
             factum of taking or not taking the cognizance of schedule
             offence is irrelevant and immaterial for the purposes of reason
             to believe under Section 19 for making arrest. The schedule
             offence has relevance only to the extent that for initiating
             inquiry under PMLA thereto either be an FIR under schedule
             offence or a complaint under schedule offence. The registration
             of FIR or the filing of complaint is only a trigger point for
             starting investigation under PMLA and in the entire Act it is
             nowhere mandatory that the authorities concerned with PMLA
             investigation should wait till such time cognizance of schedule
             offence is taken by the concerned Court.
         31.         The learned counsel for the respondent/department would
             therefore urge that none of the submissions made for grant of
             bail hold good because the investigation under PMLA was
             undertaken only after SFIO filed a complaint on 29.11.2016
             under the schedule offences covered under Part-A; the offences
             where the Act is continuing un-awaited and in respect of which
             the starting point was immaterial and since proceeds of crime is
             not a seriously debatable issue as contended by learned counsel
             for the petitioners. It is urged by learned counsel for the
             respondent/department that rigours of Section 45 of PMLA
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                  Page 24 of 34

             would not permit the grant of bail inasmuch as it is urged that
             there is no record to contend that there are reasonable ground
             for believing that the petitioners are not involved in the offence
             of money laundering or that they are not likely to commit any
             offence while on bail.      It is also urged by counsel for the
             respondent/department that there is a serious likelihood of
             tempering with the evidence. Keeping in view the nature of
             transaction which involves placement and layering of tainted
             money or the proceeds of crime by falsification of records and
             arbitrary and illegal enhancement of the share premium in
             respect of such shares which had no value in the market. The
             learned counsel for the respondent/department, therefore, urged
             that in view of the clear cut law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme
             Court in Gautam Kundu (supra), regularly followed by Hon’ble
             Supreme Court as well as different High Courts, there is no
             ground made out for grant of bail.
         32.        The instant petitions for grant of bail under Section 439
             Cr.P.C. are arising from ECIR/01/DLZO-II/2017, under
             Sections 3 & 4 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002
             on the basis of Criminal Complaint No. 57463 of 2016. The
             allegations made in ECIR/01/DLZO-II/2017 at para 7.3 is that
             M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. with the help of Chartered Accountant
             Rajesh Aggarwal and other accused persons as shown in
             ECIR/01/DLZO-II/2017 dated 11.02.2017 were involved in
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 25 of 34

             money laundering activities wherein M/s Jagat Projects Ltd.
             succeeded in laundering its unaccounted income through a set
             of companies controlled by the petitioners in the guise of share
             subscription money at a huge premium to the tune of Rs. 64.70
             Crore during the financial year 2008-09. The entire share
             subscription (including the share premium) of Rs. 64.70. Crore
             has been held to be unexplained cash credit under Section 68 of
             the Income Tax Act in the hands of M/s Jagat Projects Ltd.
         33.         Further M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. failed to explain the
             payment of Rs. 1,16,46,000/- Crore @ 1.80% on the total
             accommodation entries of Rs. 64.70 Crore made to the
             petitioners for securing accommodation entries has been an
             unexplained expenses incurred during the assessment year
             2009-10. The allegations qua against the present petitioners are
             that (1) Virendra Jain and (2) Surendra Kumar Jain (Jain
             Brothers) are involved in activities of laundering of money for
             clients having unaccounted cash and were providing the facility
             through skilled persons Chartered Accountant, Rajesh Aggarwal
             to make the unaccounted cash to white money and M/s Jagat
             Projects Ltd. succeeded in doing so to the tune of Rs. 64.70
             Crore in the form of legitimate transaction through illegal act by
             way of share subscription by various companies controlled by
             Jain Brothers (petitioners herein) to avoid the income tax
             liabilities  and  obtained    consequential   payment     of    Rs.
             1,16,40,000/- Crore @ 1.80% on the total accommodation
             entries of Rs. 64.70 Crore. The said illegal activity is the
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 26 of 34

             schedule offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering
             Act, 2002.
         34.        The modus operandi adopted by the petitioners as per the
             counter affidavit filed by the respondent/department at para
             10.16 is as under:-
                    "10.16        The modus operandi adopted by Jain
                    Brothers is to create artificially Reserve& Surplus and
                    consequent Investment in a set of private companies
                    controlled by them. A total of approximately Rs. 8000
                    Crore in the balance sheet of 08 private limited
                    companies was thus created. The second step is to
                    acquire the management control of some listed
                    companies through postal ballot. The subsequent step is
                    to pick up one of the private companies controlled by
                    them, and move an application for amalgamation. One
                    scheme of amalgamation involving Rs. 1000 Crore of
                    Reserve& Surplus and Investment, has already been was
                    completed by Jain Brothers. Subsequently, Sh. Surendra
                    Kumar Jain acquired SNLFL through postal ballot and
                    filed an application for scheme of amalgamation between
                    NKS and SNLFL. Jain brothers still left with 06
                    companies having Reserves & Surplus and investment of
                    approximately Rs. 1000 Crore in each of these companies
                    and two (2) listed NBFCs with arrangement control over
                    them. It is through the liquidation of fictitious investment
                    in the merged company, laundering of money can be
                    done."
         35.        During the investigation the respondent/department
             recorded the statement of the petitioner-Surendra Kumar Jain
             under Section 50 of PMLA which reveals that the mediator
             Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered Accountant has given cheque to
             their group/associate companies for buying shares of M/s Jagat
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                      Page 27 of 34

             Projects Ltd. at a high price, i.e. Premium of Rs 390/- per share
             on share of Rs. 10/- each per share with buy back guarantee and
             later on as per advice/direction of Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered
             Accountant those shares were transferred to the companies of
             the persons/associates of M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. at a nominal
             price of Rs. 10-12/- per share; that due to this activity of buying
             shares at premium and selling the same at nominal price, their
             holding companies have made huge losses in the books of
             account but in actual the said amount has already been received
             by their companies in advance against the sale of shares from
             the    beneficiary/mediator      Rajesh   Aggarwal,       Chartered
             Accountant and all these transaction are duly recorded in books
             of account of respective companies.
         36.        Further, out of the 30 companies 26 companies belongs to
             the petitioner-Surendera Kumar Jain and the aforesaid 26
             companies invested a sum of Rs. 62.20 Crore in the share
             capital of M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. @ premium of Rs. 390/- per
             share of Rs. 10/- each share. It further reveals that the said 26
             companies which made investment in share capital of M/s Jagat
             Projects Ltd. through Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered Accountant,
             got profit of approximately 1.50% by way of fund which was
             sent by Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered Accountant to the
             petitioner's group companies for investment in M/s Jagat
             Projects Ltd. The profit received from Rajesh Aggarwal on
             behalf of M/s Jagat Projects Ltd. has gone up to Rs.
             1,11,96,000/-.
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                     Page 28 of 34

         37.         Further, it is revealed that out of the 95 companies which
             were managed and controlled by the petitioner-Surendera
             Kumar Jain and his brother Virendra Jain, 17 companies are
             registered at 3198/15, 4th Floor, Gali No-1, Sangatrahsna,
             Paharganj, New Delhi-110055 and 24 persons who are directors
             in these 17 companies are having the same residential address.
             Further, 11 companies are registered at 209, Bhanot Plaza-II, 3
             DB Gupta Road, Paharganj, New Delhi-110055 and 15 persons
             who are directors in these 11 companies have the same
             residential address. The premises 3198/15, 4th Floor, Gali No-1,
             Sangatrahsna, Paharganj, New Delhi-110055 is owned by the
             petitioner-Virendra Jain and the premises 209, Bhanot Plaza-II,
             3 DB Gupta Road, Paharganj, New Delhi-110055 is owned by
             the petitioner-Surendra Kumar Jain and in these companies he
             himself and his family members, i.e. Virendra Jain, Preeti Jain
             and Babita Jain, are the directors. It indicates that these 95
             companies are merely companies on papers for making
             investments in share premium etc. by various beneficiaries
             through the mediators.
         38.        It further reveals that from the statement of the petitioner-
             Surendra Kumar Jain that an amount of Rs. 1,11,96,000/- was
             received as profit in the said transaction from M/s Jagat Projects
             Ltd. Further, the statement of the petitioner-Virendra Jain made
             under Section 50 of PMLA are also on the same line as that of
             the petitioner-Surendra Kumar Jain.
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                      Page 29 of 34

         39.        In totality the petitioners- (1) Virendra Jain and (2)
             Surendra Kumar Jain has created a device of money laundering
             by making investment in the share capital of M/s Jagat Projects
             Ltd. through skilled person Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered
             Accountant; without putting the business in reality by
             purchasing share capital at a high price, i.e. Premium of Rs
             390/- per share on share of Rs. 10/- each per share each with
             buy back guarantee, which made them profit of Rs.
             1,11,96,000/- through illegal means.
         40.        Admittedly the complaint was filed against the petitioners
             on the allegation of committing offence punishable under
             Section 4 of PMLA which is an Economic offence and need to
             be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The
             contention made on behalf of the petitioners that no offence is
             made out against the petitioners under Sections 420/120-B IPC,
             which is a Schedule Offence under PMLA needs to be
             considered from the material collected during the investigation
             and further to be considered by the competent Court and not by
             this Court at this stage.
         41.        The Apex Court in Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy vs. Central
             Bureau of Investigation; AIR 2013 SC 1933 has observed as
             under:-
             "34. Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be
             visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The
             economic offence having deep rooted conspiracies and
             involving huge loss of public funds needs to be viewed seriously
             and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                   Page 30 of 34

             country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the
             financial health of the country.
             35. While granting bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature
             of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the
             severity of the punishment which conviction will entail, the
             character of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to
             the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of
             the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the
             witnesses being tampered with, the larger interests of the
             public/State and other similar considerations."
             (emphasis supplied)
         42.        The Apex Court in Gautam Kundu v. Manoj Kumar,
             Assistant      Director,    Eastern   Region     Directorate      of
             Enforcement        (Prevention   of  Money     Laundering       Act)
             Government of India reported in AIR 2016 SCC 106 while
             dealing with an SLP, wherein an application for bail under
             Section 439 Cr.P.C. was rejected by the High Court, on merit
             has made the following observations:-
                    "28. Before dealing with the application for bail on merit,
                    it is to be considered whether the provisions of Section 45
                    of the PMLA are binding on the High Court while
                    considering the application for bail under Section 439 of
                    the Code of Criminal Procedure. There is no doubt that
                    PMLA deals with the offence of money laundering and
                    the Parliament has enacted this law as per commitment of
                    the country to the United Nations General Assembly.
                    PMLA is a special statute enacted by the Parliament for
                    dealing with money laundering. Section 5 of the Code of
                    Criminal Procedure, 1973 clearly lays down that the
                    provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure will not
                    affect any special statute or any local law. In other
                    words, the provisions of any special statute will prevail

                   over the general provisions of the Code of Criminal
                   Procedure in case of any conflict.
                   29. Section 45 of the PMLA starts with a non obstante
                   clause which indicates that the provisions laid down in
                   Section 45 of the PMLA will have overriding effect on the
                   general provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure in
                   case of conflict between them. Section 45 of the PMLA
                   imposes following two conditions for grant of bail to any
                   person accused of an offence punishable for a term of
                   imprisonment of more than three years under Part-A of
                   the Schedule of the PMLA:
                   (i) That the prosecutor must be given an opportunity to
                   oppose the application for bail; and
                   (ii) That the Court must be satisfied that there are
                   reasonable grounds for believing that the accused person
                   is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to
                   commit any offence while on bail.
                   30. The conditions specified Under Section 45 of the
                   PMLA are mandatory and needs to be complied with
                   which is further strengthened by the provisions of Section
                   65 and also Section 71 of the PMLA. Section 65 requires
                   that the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure shall
                   apply in so far as they are not inconsistent with the
                   provisions of this Act and Section 71 provides that the
                   provisions of the PMLA shall have overriding effect
                   notwithstanding      anything     inconsistent     therewith
                   contained in any other law for the time being in force.
                   PMLA has an overriding effect and the provisions of
                   Code of Criminal Procedure would apply only if they are
                   not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. Therefore,
                   the conditions enumerated in Section 45 of PMLA will
                   have to be complied with even in respect of an
                   application for bail made Under Section 439 of Code of
                   Criminal Procedure. That coupled with the provisions of
                   Section 24 provides that unless the contrary is proved,
                   the Authority or the Court shall presume that proceeds of
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                    Page 32 of 34

                    crime are involved in money laundering and the burden
                    to prove that the proceeds of crime are not involved, lies
                    on the Appellant."
                    33.......... We have noted that Section 45 of the PMLA will
                    have overriding effect on the general provisions of the
                    Code of Criminal Procedure in case of conflict between
                    them. As mentioned earlier, Section 45 of the PMLA
                    imposes two conditions for grant of bail, specified under
                    the said Act. We have not missed the proviso to Section
                    45 of the said Act which indicates that the legislature has
                    carved out an exception for grant of bail by a Special
                    Court when any person is under the age of 16 years or is
                    a woman or is a sick or infirm. Therefore, there is no
                    doubt that the conditions laid down Under Section 45A of
                    the PMLA, would bind the High Court as the provisions
                    of special law having overriding effect on the provisions
                    of Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for
                    grant of bail to any person accused of committing offence
                    punishable Under Section 4 of the PMLA, even when the
                    application for bail is considered Under Section 439 of
                    the Code of Criminal Procedure."
                                                           (emphasis supplied)
         43.        In the instant petitions the petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra
             Jain and (2) Surendra Kumar Jain, are involved in illegal
             activities of money laundering by way of share subscription
             with the help of a skilled person Rajesh Aggarwal, Chartered
             Accountant and the petitioners succeeded in receiving proceeds
             of crime amounting to Rs. 1,11,96,000/-, which is a Schedule
             Offence under Sections 3 & 4 of PMLA. The aforesaid
             activities of the petitioners is illegal and not permissible under
             the law. Therefore, the conditions laid down under Section 45 of
BAIL APPLN. 1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017                      Page 33 of 34

             PMLA will have an overriding effect on the general provisions
             of the Cr.P.C. This Court in cases Anand Chauhan vs.
             Directorate of Enforcement; MANU/DE/0928/2017; 240
             (2017) DLT 681 and Rohit Tandon vs. Enforcement
             Directorate; MANU/DE/1240/2017; 2017 (2) JCC 1241 had
             also said so and        the arguments advanced as well as the
             judgments relied by the learned senior counsel for the
             petitioners loses its significance in view thereof.
         44.        Consequently, this Court find no merit in the present
             petitions and the bail applications, i.e. BAIL APPLN.
             1113/2017 & BAIL APPLN. 1114/2017, of the present
             petitioners, i.e. (1) Virendra Jain and (2) Surendra Kumar Jain
             are rejected.
         45.        Observations made in this order shall have no effect on
             the merit of the case. One copy of this order be sent to the
             concerned Court.
         46.        Let one copy of this order be placed on the file of BAIL
             APPLN. 1114/2017.
