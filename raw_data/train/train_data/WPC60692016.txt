                          JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
              Heard Mr. S.K Roy, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. C. Goswami,
      learned counsel appearing for the respondent Assam Housing Board
      authorities, Mr. G. Pegu, learned State Counsel appearing for the State
      respondent authorities and Mr. S. Borthakur, learned counsel appearing for
      the respondent No.5.
      2.       The petitioner was allotted a flat being LIG Building No.2, Flat No.6
      for residential purpose at a monthly rent of `1500/- per month and against a
      security deposit of `15,000/-. The allotment was made vide order
      No.SHB/Rent/19/2004/26-A dated 16.12.2004. It is the case of the petitioner
      that after 10(ten) years of her occupying the aforesaid apartment, the
      respondent No.4 being the Commissioner, Assam State Housing Board had
      issued a letter dated 15.02.2014 to the petitioner requiring her to submit an
WP(C) No.6069 of 2016                                                             Page 1 of 4

      affidavit that she has no other landed property in her name in greater
      Guwahati. It is stated that the said notice was issued at the instance of Sri
      Pradip Barman, who is the respondent No.5 herein. The petitioner accordingly
      submitted an affidavit dated 26.02.2014 before the respondent No.4 stating
      on oath that she has no landed property in her name in greater Guwahati.
      3.       The respondent authorities again issued a letter dated 07.03.2015
      enclosing a copy of the electricity bill addressed to the petitioner, thereby
      concluding that the petitioner has some other landed property in Guwahati.
      The petitioner was required to clarify whether the concerned electricity bill
      was of her own or not. The petitioner replied thereto that although the
      electricity bill was in her name, but she was not the owner of the premises,
      for which the said electricity bill was issued. It is stated that on the other
      hand, the said premises was in the name of her mother, which is a
      Government land.
      4.        In the aforesaid circumstances, a letter dated 11.08.2015 was issued
      by the respondent authorities requiring the petitioner to vacate her allotted
      flat being LIG Building No.2, Flat No.6 under the rental housing scheme at
      Borsojai (Bakulban) as one flat will be given to the petitioner by her mother.
      5.        Subsequently, a final notice dated 08.09.2015 was issued requiring
      the petitioner to hand over the concerned flat. Mr. C. Goswami, learned
      counsel appearing for the respondent Housing Board submits that although
      the notice dated 08.09.2015 indicates that it was the final notice, but
      however, subsequent notices had also been issued to the petitioner being the
      notices dated 19.10.2015, 24.12.2015 and 15.11.2016. The aforesaid notices
      requiring the petitioner to vacate the aforesaid flat LIG Building No.2, Flat
      No.6 has been assailed in this writ petition.
      6.       This Court by an interim order dated 04.10.2016 had given the interim
      protection to the petitioner. The petitioner refers to paragraph-15 of the
      affidavit in opposition dated 08.12.2016 of the respondent Housing Board
      Corporation, wherein certain averments had been made that for a better
      clarification, the Board had directed one Junior Engineer on 10.11.2016 to
      make an enquiry as regards the occupation of Flat No.6, LIG Building No.2.
      After making the enquiry, the said Junior Engineer vide letter dated
      15.11.2016 had submitted a report before the concerned authority stating
WP(C) No.6069 of 2016                                                           Page 2 of 4

      that on several occasion he had found no one in the said flat and the house is
      under lock and key. In paragraph-16, it is stated that the writ petitioner had
      already shifted to her own house and the flat in question is kept under lock
      and key without handing over the same to the Board.
      7.       Mr. C. Goswami, learned counsel for the Housing Board has taken a
      stand that the aforesaid notice of eviction can be assailed by the writ
      petitioner in the form of an appeal u/s 57 of the Assam State Housing Board
      Act, 1972 inasmuch as, the impugned notices had been issued by the
      respondent Board u/s 54 of the said Act.
      8.       This Court is also of the view that in order to decide the dispute at
      hand, certain factual determination would also have to be made as to whether
      the petitioner actually owns certain other landed property within greater
      Guwahati in order to disentitle herself from the allotment of the concerned flat
      under the respondent Housing Board Corporation.
      9.      In such view of the matter, this Court deems it appropriate that an
      appeal u/s 57 of the Assam State Housing Board, 1972 would be a better
      course of remedy for the petitioner to pursue against the final notice of
      eviction and the appellate authority while deciding the appeal shall give due
      consideration to all such factual aspects that the respective parties may raise.
      10.     However, the petitioner is concerned that paragraphs-15 and 16 of the
      affidavit dated 08.12.2016 discloses certain events, which had taken place
      after the final notice of eviction had been issued and therefore, the appellate
      authority while deciding the issue should not take into account such facts as
      stated in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the affidavit.
      11.     The said contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is found
      to be acceptable in view of the provisions of the law laid down by the Hon’ble
      Supreme Court in the judgment rendered in M ohinder Singh Gill and
      another-vs- The Chief Election Com m issioner, New Delhi and others ,
      reported in (1978) 1 SCC 405 .
      12.     In view of such law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, it is not
      permissible for the respondent Housing Board to refer any other subsequent
      event or reason to justify an event that had already occurred prior to it.
      Therefore, the appellate authority while deciding the appeal of the petitioner,
WP(C) No.6069 of 2016                                                           Page 3 of 4

      shall take into consideration only such facts that were available before the
      Assam State Housing Board Corporation at the time or prior to issuing the
      aforesaid notice of eviction. While deciding the issue, the appellate authority
      shall give the petitioner as well as the respondent Housing Board all due
      opportunities to present their respective cases and also allow them to produce
      any relevant materials or information that they may desire to produce. The
      appellate authority shall also give appropriate opportunity of hearing as
      aforesaid to the respondent No.5 Sri Pradip Barman.
      13.      Mr. S. K. Roy, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as per
      the prevailing act and the rules, the concerned flat owner is entitled to an
      opportunity of filing an affidavit.
      14.       The appellate authority while considering the matter, shall give the
      petitioner such opportunity to file her affidavit.
      15.      The aforesaid decision be preferably taken by the appellate authority
      within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of
      this order. Till such final decision is given by the appellate authority, the
      earlier interim order dated 04.10.2016 of this Court shall continue.
               In terms of the above, the writ petition stands disposed of.
                                                                            JUDGE
