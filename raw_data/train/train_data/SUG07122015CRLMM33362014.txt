       HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL GAUR
%
                              JUDGMENT
1.     Probity of a legendary National Political Party is under scanner in
these petitions. This case is one of its own kind. The complainant claims
to be a public spirited person, who wishes to expose cheating, criminal
breach of trust and criminal misappropriation in high places with a view
to protect general public interest. In an attempt to do so, recourse to
criminal law is sought to be made. The complainant, who is a respondent
herein, is a Parliamentarian, who claims to have been a Member of
Parliament for five times and his credentials are highlighted in the
impugned order. The respondent-complainant claims to be champion in
leading crusade against corruption. This time, he has sought to expose
cheating, fraud, criminal misappropriation, etc., by Office Bearers of the
Congress Party who also happen to be the members of a Private
Company-Young Indian Private Company (hereinafter referred to as Y.I.)
and major shareholders of Associated Journals Private Limited
(hereinafter referred to as AJL), which was engaged in publishing of
newspapers including National Herald, etc..
2.     On a criminal complaint filed by Dr. Subramanian Swamy
(hereinafter referred to as respondent/complainant) alleging cheating,
etc., trial court after recording pre-summoning evidence of the
complainant-Dr. Subramanian Swamy (CW-1), a Charted Accountant-
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15               Page 4 of 27

M.R.Ventakesh (CW-2), an official from Registrar of Companies-Gulab
Chand (CW-3) and J. Gopikrishnan (CW-4) associated with the
newspaper-The Pioneer, vide impugned order of 26th June, 2014 has
summoned petitioners of the above-captioned five petitions as accused
No. 1 to 7 for the offences under Sections 403, 406 and 420 read with
Section 120-B of IPC.
3.      All the seven accused are petitioners in the above captioned five
petitions. Accused Nos.1 to 4 are the President, Vice-President, General
Secretary and Treasurer of the Congress Party, who are also the
Director/Shareholders of Y.I.. Accused Nos. 3 and 4 are also the
Directors of AJL. Accused No.3 is also the Chairman of AJL. Accused
Nos. 5 and 6 are the Directors of Y.I. as well as AJL. Accused No.7 is
Y.I. having a share capital of `5 lacs only, formed with the objective of
instilling democratic and secular values in the entire populace.
4.      Factual background of this case, as highlighted by respondent-
complainant, already stands noted in detail in the impugned order and
hence needs no reproduction. The sum and substance of the case set up
against petitioners/accused is that when AJL had closed the printing and
publication of newspapers, like National Herald, etc. in the year 2008, it
owed a huge debt of `90 crores to the Congress Party. Although this debt
had accumulated over a period of time, but it is pertinent to note that this
huge unpaid debt was outcome of interest free loans extended by the
Congress Party to AJL from time to time. It has to be kept in mind that
AJL was a Public Limited Company, which had immovable assets having
value of crores of rupees. It is matter of record that Congress Party had
assigned the huge debt of `90 crores to a Section 25 Company i.e. Young
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15            Page 5 of 27

Indian on receiving a paltry amount of `50 lacs only. For this, the
Congress Party owes an explanation to its supporters, donors, etc.. It is
also matter of record that accused No.1-Mrs. Sonia Gandhi and her son-
Rahul Gandhi, who is accused No.2, owned 38% each of the shares i.e.
76% of Young Indian Company. The debt which AJL owed to Congress
Party now stood transferred to Young Indian which was formed in
November, 2010. Pertinently, in December, 2010, AJL increased its share
equity by allotting large chunk of its shares to Young Indian in lieu of the
debt owed to Congress Party which now stood assigned to Young Indian.
Thus, AJL became a wholly owned company of Y.I. by merely paying
`50 lacs and in this manner, Y.I. acquired complete control of AJL which
had real estate assets of at least `2,000 crores in prime areas of New
Delhi, Lucknow, Bhopal, Mumbai, Indore, Patna, Panchkula and other
places. According to respondent-complainant, the conservative real estate
worth of AJL is `5,000/- crores.
5.     It is the case of respondent-complainant that Y.I. after acquiring
the control over AJL, declared that it will not publish any newspaper
including National Herald. Undisputedly, National Herald building is a
prime property in New Delhi, which was leased out for commercial
purpose and AJL is receiving rental of `60 lacs per month in respect of
this property alone. The precise stand of respondent-complainant is that
accused Nos. 1 and 2 had hatched criminal conspiracy with accused Nos.
3 to 6, who are their loyalists, to defraud the Congress Party and AJL by
dubiously forming Y.I. Company to misappropriate the huge assets of
AJL and petitioners/accused have committed criminal breach of trust
reposed in the Congress Party as well as AJL and its shareholders.

According to respondent-complainant, the rights of the shareholders of
AJL and its properties had been dishonestly misappropriated by
petitioners/accused by conversion of loan of `90 crores odd into equity
shares in favour of Y.I. and in this dubious manner, the shareholders of
AJL and the supporters of the Congress Party have been cheated.
6.     Respondent-complainant maintains that AJL owed `90 crores odd
to Congress Party in relation to zero interest unsecured loans and AJL had
no other liability. It is asserted by Respondent-complainant that if the
assets of AJL had been liquidated, then hundreds of shareholders of AJL
would have received back sums equivalent to several thousand times the
amount invested by them originally and the Congress Party would have
got back the loan with interest, but instead of adopting such a transparent
course, by dubious means, petitioners have misappropriated the entire
assets of AJL by gaining effective control over the entire assets of AJL
and thus, the original shareholders of AJL as well as the
supporters/donors of Congress Party have been cheated by petitioners.
7.     The substratum of the pre-summoning evidence led by respondent-
complainant finds mention in the impugned order. The sequence of
events has been recapitulated in the impugned order. The factual eight
steps enumerated in the instant complaint, which gives the gist of this
complaint, are spelt out as under:-
      Step 1:     AJL was formally closed and printing of the
                  newspapers terminated in April 2008.
      Step 2:     In December 2010, Board of Directors of Young
                  Indian formally passed a Resolution offering to own
                  the outstanding debt of AJL of `90 crores. This offer
                  was accepted by the Chairman and Board of AJL.

      Step 3:     Accused no.1 to 4 as Senior Office Bearers of
                  Congress Party used their position to provide an
                  unsecured zero interest of loan of `90 crores.
      Step 4:     The AJL thereafter held a meeting of their Board and
                  without reference to the Shareholders resolved that in
                  lieu of Young Indian owing the debt and for a further
                  consideration of `50 Lakhs, the entire share equity of
                  AJL would be transferred to Young Indian. Thus, AJL
                  became a wholly owned company of Young Indian.
      Step 5:     Accused no.1 as the President of the Congress Party
                  alongwith accused no.2, 3 & 4 thereafter, held a
                  meeting of the Congress Party and decided to write
                  off the loan from the Party as irrecoverable by falsely
                  holding that the Net Worth of the Company is
                  negative.
      Step 6:     Thus, having possession of the vast Real Estate, the
                  Young Indian declared through accused no.2 that
                  Young Indian will not engage in publishing a
                  newspaper including National Herald as it was
                  against the declared objective submitted for obtaining
                  the registration under Section 25 of the Companies
                  Act.
      Step 7:     The Memorandum of Association of the AJL bars the
                  Company from entering into any transaction which is
                  not for furthering its objective to publish newspapers.
      Step 8:     National Herald House is a prime property in
                  Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and was given by the
                  Government for the purpose of publishing a
                  newspaper at concessional rates. However, the Young
                  Indian now owner of the National Herald House has
                  opened this property for commercial renting such as
                  to Multinational Companies and to the Ministry of
                  External Affairs for its Passport Seva Kendra on rent.

8.     What role has been played by petitioners/accused has been also
spelt out in the impugned order, which needs no reproduction as the facts
are not in dispute. To highlight the criminal conspiracy amongst
petitioners, reliance was placed by respondent-complainant on a chart
showing inter connection between the office bearers of All India
Congress Party, Directors of Associated Journal Limited and the
Directors of Young Indian company. For ready reference, the relied upon
Chart (Annexure-15) is reproduced as under: -

9.      In the impugned order, trial court has subjected the case of
respondent-complainant to the test of a prima facie case. By relying upon
Apex Court’s decision in A.R. Antulay v. Ram Dass (1984) 2 SCC 500
trial court has concluded that anyone can put the criminal law into motion
except where the statute enacting or creating an offence indicates to the
contrary. After adverting to the ingredients of the offence of cheating,
criminal breach of trust, dishonest misappropriation and criminal
conspiracy, trial court has concluded as under: -
             “From the complaint and the evidence led so far it
      appears that YI was infact created as a sham or a cloak to
      convert public money to personal use or as a special purpose
      vehicle for acquiring control over `2000 crores worth of
      assets of The AJL and since all the accused persons have
      allegedly acted in consortium with each other to achieve the
      said nefarious purpose/ design, there are sufficient grounds for
      proceedings against all of them. It goes without saying that
      guilt of an accused is determined after trial when the burden of
      proof is discharged beyond reasonable doubt. This is only the
      stage of summoning of the accused. When the accused persons
      appear before the court they shall be at liberty to refute the
      allegations of the complainant, cross-examine the
      complainant’s witnesses and to lead evidence in their defence.
      However, as the complainant has established a prima facie
      case against the accused u/s 403, 406 and 420 read with
      section 120B I.P.C. hence, let the accused No 1 to 6 namely
      Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, Mr. Rahul Gandhi, Sh. Moti Lal Vohra,
      Sh. Oscar Fernandes, Sh. Suman Dubey and Mr. Sam Pitroda
      be summoned for 7.08.2014. Let the accused No.7 (Young
      Indian) be summoned through it’s authorized representative
      for the same date.”
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15            Page 10 of 27

10.    At the hearing, it was submitted by both the sides that the common
impugned order in the above captioned five petitions is to be tested on
identical submissions and so, with the consent of both the sides, these
petitions were heard together while treating Crl.M.C.3333/2014 to be the
lead case and after having heard both the sides at length, these petitions
are being disposed of by this common judgment.
11.    At the outset, this Court places on record its deep appreciation for
the able assistance rendered by both the sides to facilitate a proper
understanding of facts in the light of the evidence led and the contextual
reference to the judicial precedents.
12.    To assail the impugned order, vide which petitioners have been
summoned as accused, precise submissions have been advanced in the
form of written synopsis, which were supplemented by oral submissions
and reliance was placed upon various decisions to highlight that upon a
bare reading of the complaint in question, no criminal offence is prima
facie made out.
13.    With much persuasiveness, learned senior counsels for petitioners
had submitted that none of the ingredients of alleged offences exists.
Attention of this Court was drawn to the comparative chart filed
alongwith the written synopsis to highlight as to how the findings
returned in the impugned order are unsustainable. It was asserted that due
to historical and emotive bond, money was advanced by the Congress
Party to AJL from time to time and the objective of the Congress Party as
well as AJL is to uphold the legacy and tradition of secularism and non-
alignment. It was pointed out that there is no statutory provision, rule,
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15           Page 11 of 27

regulation or by-law which prohibits disbursement of money to a
newspaper, which is closely linked to the Congress Party and infact
Section 13 A of Income Tax Act contemplates “income from other
sources” in respect of Political Parties, which are run on donations and
other Political Parties have also invested money in mutual funds, etc..
Pointed reference was made to Bhartiya Janta Party (for short BJP)
investing in Canstar Fund.
14.    It was asserted on behalf of petitioners that constitution of the
Congress Party permits for formation of a trust to hold immovable
properties belonging to the Congress Party and there is no allegation that
petitioners-accused were the trustees of the funds of the Congress Party.
It was also asserted that Congress Party could have written off the loan of
`90 crores advanced to AJL, but it had assigned it to Y.I. for `50 lacs,
which has nothing to do with the immovable property. To assert that there
is no criminal breach of trust, it was pointed out that in the first place,
there was no entrustment of any money to Congress Party and so, there is
no question of any misappropriation or breach of trust as the donations
received by the Congress Party could have been dealt with in the manner
it liked. It was asserted that there is no fraudulent misrepresentation as
AJL had no net worth and was unable to repay the debt to Congress
Party. Reliance was placed upon Apex Court’s decisions in Central
Bureau of Investigation v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta (1996)
5 SCC 591, Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India Ltd. And Others
(2006) 6 SCC 736 and V.P. Shrivastava v. Indian Explosives Limited and
Others (2010) 10 SCC 361 to assert that in the absence of any
entrustment, no criminal misappropriation can be alleged.
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15          Page 12 of 27

15.    It was next submitted on behalf of petitioners that there is no
violation of any law or breach of any contract/trust in giving of loan to
AJL. It was pointed out that neither the Representation of the Peoples Act
nor the Income Tax Act or any other Act prohibits giving of loans by
Political Party. To maintain that a Political Party can invest in
commercial ventures, reliance was placed upon a decision of Income Tax
Tribunal in Bhartiya Janata Party v. Deputy Commissioner of Income
Tax CIT (2003) 258 ITR 1. It was further submitted that writing off the
loans by Congress Party is not an illegal act nor there is any breach of
trust qua the shareholders of AJL. To assert that a shareholder is not the
owner of the assets belonging to the Company, reliance was placed upon
Apex Court’s decision in Bacha F. Guzdar, Bombay v. Commissioner of
Income Tax, Bombay (1955) 1 SCR 876. According to petitioners, it is
not for the complainant or anybody else to decide that in what manner the
affairs of AJL had to be managed.
16.    It is the case of petitioners that there was no fraudulent
misrepresentation and the control of the assets of AJL rests with the
Company and there was no dishonest inducement because allotment of
the majority of equity shares of AJL to Y.I. stands duly approved in the
AJL’s Extraordinary General Meeting of 21st January, 2011 and in the
event of winding up of Y.I., which is a Section 25 Company, its assets, if
any, shall vest in another Section 25 Company. It was pointed out that
there is nothing on record to indicate that the emoluments were being
drawn by petitioners as Directors of Y.I. or that the assets of AJL have
been depleted or that any wrongful loss has been caused to Y.I. nor
petitioners are filling their personal kitties as Directors of Y.I..
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15                Page 13 of 27

17.     On behalf of petitioners, it was pointed out that Section 403 of IPC
is applicable in respect of movable properties whereas assets of AJL are
immovable properties. According to petitioners, there is no evidence to
indicate misappropriation of any immovable property of AJL or Y.I. or
that the rental income of AJL has been misappropriated by petitioners.
Thus, it was submitted that there is neither wrongful gain or loss to AJL
or Y.I. and no illegal act has been committed by petitioners and so, on a
plain reading of the complaint in question, it can be certainly said that
neither the offence of cheating nor of fraudulent or dishonest
misappropriation is made out. It was thus submitted that in view of the
dictum of Apex Court in Thermax Limited and Others v. K.M. Johny and
Others (2011) 13 SCC 412, in the absence of essential ingredients of
dishonest intention, prosecution of petitioners in the instant complaint is
wholly untenable.        Reliance was placed upon decisions in State of
Haryana and Others v. Bhajan Lal and Others 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335,
Dhariwal Tobacco Products Limited and Others v. State of Maharashtra
and Another (2009) 2 SCC 370, Rajiv Thappar and Others v. Madan Lal
Kapoor (2013) 3 SCC 330 to submit that the stand of petitioners ought to
be considered while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
as it is manifestly clear that allegations levelled against petitioners, when
taken on their face value, do not constitute any offence.
18.     On the issue of locus standi, it was submitted that in a case of
cheating and misappropriation, victim or the person or entity cheated,
who complains of wrongful loss, alone can maintain a complaint of
cheating, misappropriation, etc.. Reliance was placed upon Apex Court’s
decision in Mohammed Ibrahim & Ors. V. State of Bihar & Anr. (2009) 8
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15              Page 14 of 27

SCC 751 to submit that a third party, who does not claim to be cheated,
cannot maintain such a complaint. Attention of this Court was drawn to
Section 39 of Cr.P.C. to point out that for the offences scheduled therein,
any person can maintain a complaint, but the offences of cheating and
criminal misappropriation are not there in the said Schedule to Section 39
of Cr.P.C.. It was thus submitted that unless the necessary mens rea is
there, such a complaint cannot be proceeded with. It was asserted on
behalf of petitioners that neither the shareholders of AJL nor any
supporter/donor of Congress Party or anyone from Y.I. has made any
complaint and infact, only such persons are competent to file the
complaint in question and not the respondent-complainant, who has
malafidely filed the instant complaint. It was submitted that the complaint
in question proceeds on the basis of unwarranted assumptions and
presumptions and contains misstatement of facts and so, there is no
justification to proceed further with the instant complaint.
19.     It was vehemently contended on behalf of petitioners that no
inference of criminal conspiracy can be drawn as there is no material on
record to suggest that Y.I. was formed as a part of criminal conspiracy to
take over the assets of AJL. It was pointed out that it is a matter of record
that none of the assets of AJL has been taken over by Y.I. and there was
no element of cheating in granting or assigning of loan as no unlawful act
has been done by petitioners to attract any criminality. It was also pointed
out that rental income accruing to AJL has not been transferred to Y.I. or
any of its Directors and the incorporation of Y.I. and its objective is not
incompatible with the revival of AJL and the decision not to publish any
newspaper cannot attract any criminal liability, as it is for the AJL to
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15            Page 15 of 27

decide whether to revive National Herald or not. The precise stand taken
on behalf of petitioners that the impugned order smacks of mala fides and
discloses utter non-application of mind as the necessary ingredients of the
offences alleged are lacking and so, malicious prosecution of petitioners
ought to be ended to secure the ends of justice.
20.    Learned Senior Counsel for the remaining petitioners adopted the
submissions advanced on behalf of above petitioners and had
supplemented by asserting that entertaining of the complaint in question
qua accused-Sam Pitroda and Oscar Fernandes, who reside outside the
jurisdiction of the trial court, is barred as it is not preceded by an inquiry.
21.    The submissions advanced on behalf of petitioners were concised
by Dr. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel for one of the petitioners, as
under: -
       i)      No conversion, appropriation by Y.I. for benefit is possible.
       ii)     Y.I. is Section 25 Company-barred in law from giving any
               benefit,    salary,     remuneration,    dividend   etc   to     its
               shareholders.
       iii)    All properties owned by AJL remains in ownership of AJL;
               only shareholders of AJL change.
       iv)     In law, shareholders of a company do not own properties
               owned by the company. Company is a separate legal entity.
               Ownership of shares in company is not ownership of
               properties of company.
       v)      Since all properties remain properties of AJL, there is and
               can be no entrustment.
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15                Page 16 of 27

       vi)     No identifiable or identified person or entity even claims to
               be deceived or cheated as a victim.
       vii)    Complainant himself filed the balance sheet of AJL and Y.I.
               shows;
               a) Property of AJL remains property of AJL at all times.
               b) Rent received from these properties is received by AJL
                   and so shown in balance sheet.
               c) AJL is a loss making company, admittedly, and hence no
                   dividend     declared.     So    neither Y.I. nor  accused
                   shareholder of Y.I. can get any dividend.
               d) Y.I. balance sheet similarly shows nil income received.
22.    Finally, it was submitted on behalf of petitioners that by
entertaining the complaint in question and by passing the impugned
order, trial court has abused the process of law and so, the instant
complaint and the impugned order deserves to be quashed.
23.    Respondent-complainant, who has chosen to argue these petitions
in person, had submitted at the outset that impugned order suffers from
no illegality or perversity and that there is due application of mind. It was
submitted that in the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C., the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations cannot be gone
into and the inherent powers are to be exercised with circumspection on
the basis of the complaint and not by taking into consideration any fresh
material/documents. To submit so, reliance was placed upon Apex
Court’s decision in N.Soundaram v. P.K.Pounraj & Anr. 2014 (10) SCC
616.
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15              Page 17 of 27

24.    Dismissal of these petitions was sought by respondent-complainant
by submitting that petitioners have alternate remedy to approach the trial
court while invoking Section 245 of Cr.P.C.. Reliance was placed upon
Apex Court’s decision in Nupur Talwar v. CBI (2012) 11 SCC 465 to
submit that it is not essential for trial court to deliver a detailed order
while issuing the process. It was submitted that sufficient grounds exist
for summoning petitioners for the offences in question. It was highlighted
by respondent-complainant as to how interest free loan was questionably
extended to AJL by Congress Party and was dubiously assigned to Y.I.,
who had in turn, taken over the Management of AJL and thereby offence
of cheating, criminal misappropriation has been blatantly committed by
petitioners, which calls for their prosecution in the instant complaint. It
was asserted by respondent-complainant that the question of locus standi
does not arise as the supporters/donors, etc., of Congress Party as well as
the shareholders of AJL have been blatantly duped and larger public
interest has been sacrificed which is a serious cause of concern as the
trust reposed in the Congress Party has been openly breached. It was
pointed out that with the mala fide intention, Special Purpose Vehicle i.e.
Y.I. was floated to indirectly acquire the control of AJL without being
saddled with huge liabilities.
25.    According to respondent-complainant, the modus operandi of
petitioners clearly smacks of criminal intent. As per respondent-
complainant, an extraordinary and unprecedented fraud has been played
upon the entire nation by petitioners. Respondent-complainant maintained
that the first step in the commission of the crime in question i.e. criminal
breach of trust, is assigning of the Deed of Assignment of Loan and the
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15           Page 18 of 27

second pre-mediated step, smacking of criminal conspiracy to commit the
offences in question, is the extinguishment of the debt of `90 crores odd
by merely paying `50 lacs and of converting the assigned loan into equity
shares and thereby acquiring the control over AJL having huge assets of
`2,000/- crores.
26.    According to respondent-complainant, Extraordinary General
Meeting (EGM) was indeed held but with just seven shareholders and no
proxies and yet, it was said that the quorum was requisite. The legality of
this EGM is questioned by respondent-complainant by pointing out that
approximately 99% shares of AJL stood transferred to Y.I. and thus, AJL
became an almost wholly owned subsidiary of Y.I.. In the written
synopsis placed on record by respondent-complainant, it has been
highlighted as to how 761 shareholders of AJL were reduced to minority
status of 1% with no clue as to what was in store for them and instead of
reviving the newspaper publication, the assets of AJL are being misused
to earn commercial profits, which was not the purpose of AJL. In support
of the stand taken by respondent-complainant, reliance was placed upon
decisions in Binod Kumar & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr; (2014) 10 SCC
663; N.Soundaram v. P.K.Pounraj & Anr; (2014) 10 SCC 616, Rishipal
Singh v. State of U.P. (2014) 7 SCC 215; Arvind Kejriwal & Ors. v. Amit
Sibal & Anr. (2014) 1 JCC 229; Rajiv Thapar & Ors. v. Madan Lal
Kapoor (2013) 3 SCC 330; Crl.M.C. 4751 of 2013 titled Kamla Rana v.
NCT State & Ors. decided on 19th May, 2014; Nupur Talwar v. CBI
(2012) 11 SCC 465; Bhushan Kumar v. NCT (2012) 5 SCC 424;

Public Interest Litigation & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (2012) 3 SCC
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15          Page 19 of 27

& Ors. (1992) Supp. (1) SCC 335 and Express Newspapers (P) Ltd. v.
Union of India AIR 1986 SC 872.
27.     Lastly, it was submitted by respondent-complainant that the
conspiracy to commit the offence in question is writ large on the face of it
and so, prosecution of petitioners in the complaint in question is very well
justified on merits and no case for quashing the instant complaint or the
impugned order is made out. Thus, dismissal of these petitions is sought.
28.     The respective stand taken by both the sides needs to be considered
in view of the fact that in a democratic set up, how a Political Party of
national stature acts is everybody’s concern. Rather, it is a matter of
serious concern as allegations of fraud, etc. are levelled against the
Congress Party, who has ruled the Nation for many decades. Precisely, it
is the act of Office Bearers of Congress Party and their associates which
is under scanner in this case.
29.     Upon evaluating the impugned order on the touchstone of judicial
precedents and in the light of submissions advanced by both the sides,
this Court finds that question of locus standi of respondent-complainant
to maintain the complaint in question pales into insignificance in view of
the fact that Apex Court in Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh
(supra) has reiterated that freedom of a private citizen to proceed against
the corrupt cannot be restricted. It will not be fair to literally interpret
Section 39 of Cr.P.C. or to assert that a private citizen is free to proceed
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15            Page 20 of 27

against corrupt public servants but not against a political party when it is
accused of serious offences of cheating, misappropriation, etc.. In a
unique case, like the instant one, expanded meaning to the law has to be
given. In the considered opinion of this Court, the plea of locus standi
cannot be restricted to typical cases of cheating, misappropriation, etc., as
here is a case where the act of Office Bearers of Political Party having
criminal overtones is under scrutiny and so, the challenge to the locus of
respondent-complainant to maintain the complaint in question is hereby
repelled.
30.    Impugned order elaborately notes the facts of this case and
considers the pre-summoning evidence, the ingredients of the offences
alleged and after considering the judicial precedents and the submissions
advanced, concludes that a prima facie case to summon petitioners as
accused is made out. Upon scrutiny of the impugned order, this Court is
constrained to note that the presumptive observations made by the trial
court are uncalled for and such a deeper scrutiny of facts is not required
to be undertaken at this initial stage and on a bird’s eye view, it is
required to be seen whether a prima facie case to summon petitioners as
accused is made out or not. Such a deep scrutiny of facts is required at
the charge stage and not at the summoning stage.
31.    In the instant case, it cannot be disputed that the Office Bearers of
the Congress Party are the trustees of the funds belonging to the Party. No
doubt, a Political Party can have income from other sources as well and
can invest money in mutual funds, etc., to augment its resources.
However, it has to be kept in mind that the allegations against the Office
Bearers of the Congress Party are of siphoning off the party funds in a
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15            Page 21 of 27

clandestine manner. The impropriety of extending interest free loans to a
separate legal entity i.e. AJL, which is a Public Limited Company, by the
Congress Party is a matter of concern in a democratic set up, particularly,
when the source of Congress Party’s fund is largely from donations given
by public and so, any citizen can legitimately question the siphoning off
funds by Political Party. What crops up in the mind of a prudent person is
as to where was the need of extending interest free loans to a Public
Limited Company engaged in a commercial venture of publishing
newspapers.
32.    Considering the fact that AJL has sizeable assets of `2000 crores, it
needs to be explained by petitioners as to what was the need to assign the
huge debt of `90 crores when this debt could have been easily liquidated
by AJL from its sizeable assets. Even writing off such a huge debt by the
Congress Party can legitimately attract allegations of cheating, fraud, etc..
Petitioners had gone step further in conspiring to get this huge debt
assigned to a Special Purpose Vehicle i.e. Y.I. and thereafter, to hijack
AJL via Y.I.. Such grave allegations levelled against petitioners cannot
be brushed aside lightly by relying upon judicial precedents cited, to
conclude that the ingredients of the criminal offences alleged are lacking.
To say the least, to do so would be preposterous. Such a prima facie view
is being taken in view of the fact that the assignment of the huge debt by
Congress Party to Y.I. was for a paltry sum of `50 lacs. This is certainly
questionable and justifiably attracts the allegations of cheating,
misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, etc.. Such a view is being
taken as it needs to be explained before the trial court as to how the net
worth of AJL can be negative when it has assets worth crores of rupees. It
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15           Page 22 of 27

also crops up in the mind of a prudent person as to why interest free loan
was assigned and why it was not written off. In any case, writing off
such a huge debt by a legendry Political Party is indeed questionable.
Instead of adopting such a questionable course, what was done by the
Congress Party is more questionable. It also needs to be answered as to
why the genuine shareholders were marginalized in the Extraordinary
General Meeting, which was attended by just seven shareholders. Such a
questionable conduct of petitioners certainly invites allegations of
committing the offences for which petitioners have been summoned. Is it
not criminal misappropriation of Congress Party’s funds? This aspect
needs to be addressed after respondent-complainant is cross-examined at
the pre-charge stage. It also needs to be examined at pre-charge stage as
to whether lacs of citizens who had donated to the Congress Party felt
cheated by assignment of such a huge debt to Y.I. who was managed by
none others than petitioners, who were Office Bearers of Congress Party
as well as Directors of Y.I.. Not only this, the main persons, who were
instrumental in allegedly siphoning off political funds were the recipients
of the assignment of the huge debt by the Congress Party and they were
the same persons, who had clandestinely acquired the control of AJL. All
this smacks of criminality. What species of criminal offence is made out
is not required to be seen at this initial stage.
33.    In all fairness to petitioners, it needs to be noted that subtle factual
inaccuracies in the stand taken by respondent-complainant were pointed
out, but this Court finds that the so-called inaccuracies pointed out do not
substantially impact upon the substratum of the case set up against
petitioners as it is immaterial as to whether the existing share equity was
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15              Page 23 of 27

taken over by Y.I. or fresh shares were floated to marginalize the existing
shareholders and without any public issue of the fresh shares floated, they
were allotted to Y.I.. Rather, this is more questionable. At this stage, it
would not be worthwhile to consider as to whether a share holder owes
the assets of the company or not, because more than 90% of the shares
were acquired by Y.I. in a questionable manner.
34.     Considering the role played by petitioners-Sam Pitroda and Oscar
Fernandes, I find that hyper-technical objections to their summoning on
the premise that they reside outside the territorial jurisdiction of the trial
court and so, their summoning ought to be preceded by an inquiry, does
not carry much substance. The sum and substance of the allegations
levelled against petitioners cannot be brushed aside by merely saying that
at best it is a case of takeover of AJL and the remedy lies in invoking the
provisions of the Company Act. Upon reading the complaint as a whole,
it emerges that the transactions of the Congress Party with AJL via Y.I.
are not a mere commercial transactions as these transactions legitimately
attract    the    allegations     of    cheating,     fraud, breach  of    trust,
misappropriation, etc.
35.     During the course of hearing, an apprehension was expressed by
respondent-complainant that since petitioners have acquired full control
of AJL, therefore, the day is not far away when petitioners would
liquidate the assets of AJL by converting Y.I., a Charitable Company,
into any other kind of company as Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013
now permits adoption of such a course. This was strongly refuted by
learned senior counsel for petitioners by submitting that this is beyond the
purview of the complaint and so, this cannot be considered in these
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15               Page 24 of 27

proceedings. Certainly, this aspect cannot be considered in these
proceedings, but it is indeed a cause of concern, which needs to be
addressed if any upright citizen seeks to explore this aspect in the
background of this case by having recourse to appropriate forum. This
aspect is left open, without expressing any opinion, lest it may prejudice
petitioners.
36.    This Court has taken notice of the submissions advanced on behalf
of petitioners and is constrained to observe that legal jugglery of words
does not and cannot persuade this Court to opine at this initial stage that
the allegations made in the complaint in question do not make out a
prima facie case to summon petitioners. As already noticed above, the
submissions now advanced are infact required to be considered at the
charge stage, as by then, after cross-examination of respondent-
complainant, full baked facts would come to the fore. At present, the facts
are half baked in the sense that one side of the picture is emerging but
upon taking the case of respondent-complainant on its face value, it
cannot be prima facie said that the ingredients of the offences alleged are
lacking. It needs no reiteration that this is not the stage to even prima
facie opine that the ingredients of any of the alleged offences exist to
justify putting petitioners on trial or not. Any observation made in this
regard by the trial court or this Court shall have no bearing when the case
of petitioners is considered at the charge stage.
37.    Apex Court in N. Soundaram v. P.K. Pounraj and Another (2014)
10 SCC 616 has reiterated the principles governing the inherent
jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. by reminding the Courts that
this power has to be exercised sparingly and cautiously to prevent abuse
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15           Page 25 of 27

of process of the court and to secure the ends of justice while cautioning
that inherent powers should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate
prosecution and High Courts should refrain from giving a prima facie
opinion at the initial stage unless there are compelling reasons to do so, as
the case set up has to be considered as it is, without adding or subtracting
anything to it. Applying the afore-noted parameters to the instant case,
this Court finds that the ingredients of the offences alleged are not lacking
and sufficient ground to proceed against petitioners certainly exists. No
mala fides can be alleged against respondent-complainant nor can it be
said that the summoning of petitioners is an abuse of process of the court.
38.     This Court is of the considered view that the gravity of the
allegations levelled against petitioners has a fraudulent flavour involving
a national Political Party and so, serious imputations smacking of
criminality levelled against petitioners need to be properly looked into.
39.     After having considered the entire case in its proper perspective,
this Court finds no hesitation to put it on record that the modus operandi
adopted by petitioners in taking control of AJL via Special Purpose
Vehicle i.e. Y.I., particularly, when the main persons in Congress Party,
AJL and Y.I. are the same, evidences a criminal intent. Whether it is
cheating, criminal misappropriation or criminal breach of trust is not
required to be spelt out at this nascent stage. In any case, by no stretch of
imagination, it can be said that no case for summoning petitioners as
accused in the complaint in question is made out. Questionable conduct
of petitioners needs to be properly examined at the charge stage to find
out the truth and so, these criminal proceedings cannot be thwarted at this
initial stage. Such a view is being formed on a bird’s eye view of the
Crl.M.Cs.3332/14, 3333/14, 3335/14, 3336/14 & 2156/15             Page 26 of 27

whole case and the observations in the impugned order of there being a
prima facie case have to be read in the context of there being sufficient
grounds for summoning petitioners.
40.    Without casting any reflection on the merits of this case and while
leaving the larger questions raised in these petitions open, to be
considered at the charge-stage, these petitions and the pending
applications are dismissed with afore-noted clarification.
