1.            In these appeals the common order dated 22.07.208 passed
by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is in question. The issue sought
to be raised in these appeals is whether the licence fee payable to the
railways for use of land as a depot, could be regarded as an accrued
liability or a contingent liability. It was pointed out by the learned
counsel for the appellant/ assessee that before the Tribunal he had taken
a specific plea that in the assessee’s own case for the assessment year
ITA Nos. 1349/08, 1350/08, 1351/08, 1352/08, 1353/08 & 1354/08            Page No.1 of 3

1995-1996, which had been decided by the Tribunal vide its order
dated 25.11.2004, the said licence fee has been construed to be an
accrued liability and, therefore, allowable as an expenditure in the year
of accrual. Unfortunately, the Tribunal has not returned any finding on
this aspect of the matter.
2.            Consequently, we feel that the impugned order requires to be
set aside and the matters to be remanded to the Tribunal for a
consideration on this aspect of the matter. According to the learned
counsel for the appellant / assessee the matter stood concluded by
virtue of the decision of the Tribunal in respect of the assessment year
1995-1996 and, therefore, there was no occasion for re-entering into
the dispute of whether the licence fee payable was a contingent liability
or an accrued liability. The learned counsel for the appellant/ assessee
submits that the Tribunal ought to have followed its decision in respect
of the assessment year 1995-1996 particularly when no appeal
therefrom had been preferred by the revenue and the issue had become
final.
3.            Mr Jolly, who appears on behalf of the revenue, submits that
he does not have any instructions whether any appeal has been
preferred from the order of the Tribunal pertaining to the assessment
year 1995-1996. In any event, since we are remanding the matters to
ITA Nos. 1349/08, 1350/08, 1351/08, 1352/08, 1353/08 & 1354/08 Page No.2 of 3

the Tribunal for a consideration on this aspect of the matter, the
Tribunal would examine as to whether the revenue had preferred any
appeal therefrom or not and the effect thereof.
4.            The impugned order is set aside. The appeals are remanded
to the Tribunal for a consideration afresh as per the directions given
above. The matters be placed before the Tribunal on 15.01.2009 for
further directions.
       The appeals stand disposed of.
