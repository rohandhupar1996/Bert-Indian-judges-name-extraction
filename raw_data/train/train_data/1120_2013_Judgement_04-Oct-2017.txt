A.K. SIKRI, J.
                Leave granted.
    2) Nawab Nusrat Jung Bahadur-1 (Nusrat Jung-I) had purchased
        1635 acres and 34 guntas of land in Kotham Kunta, also known
        as Asad Nagar, which is now renamed as Kokapet village. This
        land was purchased way back in 19 th Century, while sale deed
        was registered sometime in the year 1852. Nusrat Jung-I died
        issueless in 1875 and his widow also died thereafter on 10 th
        October, 1916. Nusrat Jung-I had two cousins, Nawab Ghulam
        Hussain and Nawab Mohd. Sardar. Disputes about the aforesaid

(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        land (hereinafter referred to as the ‘subject lands’) erupted almost
        70 years ago and after protracted litigation, which is having
        chequered history, the said disputes have finally landed in this
        Court.      Hundreds of persons claiming themselves to be the
        successors in interest of Nusrat Jung-I have led their claim on the
        subject lands. On the other hand, the state of Andhra Pradesh
        claims that it is the State which is the legal owner of the property
        in-question.
    3) As mentioned above, these appeals have long history which has
        been taken note of, in extenso, by the High Court in its impugned
        common judgment dated 18th July, 2012, whereby number of writ
        appeals have been decided. As the impugned judgment records
        the chronology of the relevant facts correctly and no mistake is
        pointed out by any of the counsel appearing before us in regard
        to factual narrative, we can conveniently and safely reproduce
        these facts from the said judgment.
FACTUAL EVENTS IN BRIEF:
3.1     Under a sale deed dated 17th Rabi Awal, 1269 H (1852 A.D.)
        Nusrat Jung-1 purchased the schedule property, of an extent of
        Ac.1635.35 gts., from the vendors, the five sons of Mir Jouhar Ali

        khan, son of Mir Hussain Ali Khan alias Asad Nawaz Jung (late),
        the wives of Mir Jouhar Ali Khan – Imtiazunissa Begum,
        Hayatunissa Begum and the daughters of Riazunissa Begum (the
        wife of Mir Asad Nawaj Jung) – Navrooz Begum and Moula
        Begum. The property then known as Koutham Kunta and
        thereafter as Asadnagar is presently Kokapet village.
3.2     Nusrat Jung-1 died issueless around 1875 leaving behind the
        widow – Rahimunnisa Begum, who died on 10-10-1916. Nusrat
        Jung-1 had two paternal first cousins – Nawab Gulam Hussain
        and Nawab Md. Sardar.
3.3     On 16th January, 1916 the entire properties of late Nusrat Jung-1
        were taken over by Sarf-e-Khas Mubarak (the private secretariat
        of the Nizam) for supervision. A judicial branch of Sarf-e-Khas
        Mubarak initiated succession inquiry which was later transferred
        to the Court of Nazim Atiyat which was constituted under
        provisions of the 1952 Act.
3.4     In 1920 the heirs of Nusrat Jung-I represented to the Nizam for
        grant of Kokapet Jagir in their favour. By a Firman dated
        15thJamadeeussani–1339–H, the Nizam decreed rejection of the
        representation and granted only maintenance allowance, on
        compassionate grounds.
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                            Page 4 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

3.5     In 1949, Jagirs were abolished under the Abolition of Jagirs
        Regulation and in 1359F the A.P. (T.A.) Jagirs (Commutation)
        Regulation was enacted providing for interim allowance payable,
        determination of commutation and abolition of Jagirs. Then
        followed the 1952 Act, providing for Atiyat enquiries.
3.6     The Atiyat Court to which inquiry was transferred, as pointed out
        above, by its order, dated 15-02-1954 held that lands in Kokapet
        village deserve to be confirmed as Madad-e-Maash (grant-in-aid)
        in favour of heirs of the late Nusrat Jung-1; that though the land
        enjoyed by the holders as Madad-E-Maash was subsequently
        constituted into a separate village; the Maash (the property) will
        be deemed to have been continued only as Arazi (inam lands), is
        confirmed as such and Kokapet was regarded as a village only
        for administrative purposes.
3.7     The Atiyat Court also held that Kokapet was taken over by the
        Government under the Abolition of Jagirs Regulation; this action
        was not challenged by Maashadars and the question of
        appointing Qabiz for lands included in the village does not arise.
        In respect of the lands in Bagh-e-Asifnagar (another village
        having lands of Nusurat Jung-1), the Atiyat Court held that each
        of Maashadars (holders of the property) is entitled to his
        respective share and the extents being small the Collector should

        formulate proposals for disposal of lands by sale or otherwise
        after obtaining permission from the Government; should dispose
        of the same and distribute the money among the Maashadars.
3.8     Gulam Mohammed and another, aggrieved by the decision of the
        Atiyat Court dated 15th February, 1954 preferred an appeal to the
        Board of Revenue, which was rejected by the order dated 24 th
        September, 1954 and the order of the Atiyat Court was upheld.
        The order of Atiyat Court was placed before the Revenue Minister
        in the form of a note and approved by him on 22 nd December,
        1954. The Muntakhab did not set out the number of Sendhi
        (excise) trees on the land and the claimants were therefore
        denied their consequent rights.
3.9     The claimants applied to the Assistant Nazim Atiyat for
        amendment of the Muntakhab (for inclusion of Sendhi trees). The
        application was rejected. Claimants then approached the Atiyat
        Court which also rejected their claim. They unsuccessfully
        approached the Board of Revenue and thereafter filed W.P.No.
        227 of 1960. On 1st April, 1963 this Court allowed the writ petition
        and declared the claimants entitled to inclusion of income from
        Sendhi trees in the Muntakhab, directed the respondents to
        amend the Muntakhab and awarded Rs.3,980-4-0 as maash. In

        the judgment in W.P.No.227 of 1960 the High Court however
        declined to grant the relief of restoration of the property.
3.10 One Mr. K.S.B. Ali (Mr. Ali) (claiming to represent 203 legal heirs
        of Nusrat Jung-1) approached the Government several times
        seeking release of lands covered by the Muntakhab in favour of
        the legal heirs.
3.11 Firoz Khan and another filed O.S.No.512 of 1973 (originally
        O.S.No.10 of 1967) for a declaration that they are the owners of
        the plaint schedule properties in survey Nos.41, 42 and 43 of
        Kokapet Village. J.H. Krishna Murthy and four others were
        impleaded as defendants in this suit. Krishna Murthy was
        impleaded as the GPA of the heirs of Nusrat Jung – I. Krishna
        Murthy through his written statement claimed entitlement to the
        lands on the strength of the GPA granted by the heirs of late
        Nusrat Jung – I and relied on the Muntakhab in support of the
        case of the defendants. The plaintiffs also prayed for a permanent
        injunction or in the alternative for recovery of possession of the
        suit lands.
3.12 By the judgment dated 30th June, 1976, the Trial Court considered
        the entire evidence and by an elaborately reasoned order
        decreed the suit. The Trial Court concluded that the stand taken
        by the defendants was incorrect and observed that the two
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                Page 7 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        Firmans clearly established that the lands in question (Kokapet
        lands) were Jagir lands; that the legal heirs of Nusrat Jung – I had
        also admitted in cross-examination that some of them had filed
        applications for restoration of the Jagir lands to the Nizam which
        was rejected; that the first defendant (Krishna Murthy) had not
        produced any evidence to establish that the suit lands were
        acquired by Nusrat Jung – I under any purchase; and that the
        legal heirs of Nusrat Jung – I were entitled only to commutation
        amounts. This judgment became final as the appeal thereagainst
        by the defendants was dismissed by this Court by the judgment
        dated 11-12-1985 in C.C.C.A.No.142 of 1976.
3.13 170 persons claiming to be heirs of Nusrat Jung-1 filed
        W.P.No.20298 of 1993 for implementation of the Muntakhab as
        confirmed by the Revenue Minister’s order dated 24 th December,
        1954 and for mutation of their names in respect of the lands in
        Kokapet village. Reliance was placed by the petitioners
        (apparently during oral hearing of the writ petition) on a letter
        dated 21-06-2000 addressed by the CLR to the Government
        expressing an opinion that the Muntakhab must be implemented.
        By the judgment dated 09-07-2001 a learned single Judge
        disposed of the writ petition directing the Government to consider
        the report of the CLR and take further action in accordance with
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                             Page 8 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        law, within six months. Thereafter several representations were
        made, including by Mr. Ali.
3.14 On 15th April, 2002 the Principal Secretary to Government,
        Revenue Department, considered the order of this Court (dated
        09-07-2001 in W.P.No. 20298 of 1993) and rejected (by an
        elaborately reasoned order) the request of Mr. Ali for release of
        the lands as per the Muntakhab. By a subsequent Memo dated
        6th May, 2004, however, the order dated 15 th April, 2002 was
        withdrawn, again by the Principal Secretary to the Government.
        The Memo dated 6th May, 2004 records no reasons whatsoever
        for rescinding the earlier elaborate order and was issued pursuant
        to representation of Mr. Ali for reconsideration of his request, for
        implementing the Muntakhab. The Memo dated 6 th May, 2004
        merely states: Government after careful examination of the issue
        as per the Act and Rules in force, hereby withdraw the orders
        issued in the Government Memo 1stcited and the CCLA was
        directed to instruct the Collector, Ranga Reddy District and the
        concerned authorities to implement the orders of Atiyat Court
        issued in Muntakhab No. 57 of 1955.
3.15 A Memo dated 31-07-2004 reiterated the order dated 06-05-2004
        and the CLR was directed to implement the earlier Memo dated
        06-05-2004. In turn, the CLR on 07-10-2004 directed the
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                             Page 9 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        Collector, Ranga Reddy District to ensure communication of the
        Memo dated 31-07-2004 to the Mandal Revenue Officer,
        Rajendranagar for handing over possession of the open land as
        per the M.R.O.’s report dated 28-08-1984 and report compliance.
3.16 Vide Memo dated 21st May, 2005 and G.O. Ms. No. 1084 dated
        6th June, 2005 the whole issue was revisited and the earlier
        memos dated 6th May, 2004 and 31st July, 2004. In this order
        (setting out elaborate reasons) it was concluded that the finding
        of the Atiyat Court (in its order dated 15-02-1954) (that Kokapet
        village was taken over by the Government under the Abolition of
        Jagirs Regulation and the said action was not challenged by the
        Maashadars and appointment of Qabiz for the lands included in
        the village does not arise), destroys the claim of the
        representationists, of the lands being Arazi Maktha; that
        according to provisions of the Abolition of Jagirs Regulation read
        with      the      Jagir      (Commutation)         Regulations    1359-F,
        Jagirdar/Makthadar or his successor on the date of taking over of
        Jagirs were entitled to only commutation amounts, excepting
        lands which were under direct and personal cultivation of the
        Jagirdars or their successors as home farm lands under Section
        17 of the Abolition of Jagirs Regulation; that there are no home
        farm lands in the name of the claimants as per the revenue and
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                   Page 10 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        survey settlement records maintained from 1355-F (1945 AD);
        that open land would not fall within the definition of ‘Home Farm
        Lands’ as per provisio to Section 17 of the Regulation; that the
        Muntakhab was issued and acted upon by drawing commutation
        from the Nizam-e-Atiyat; and therefore there was no basis for any
        further claim in the matter. This Memo also concluded that the
        issue was finally decided by the 15-04-2002 order issued with
        approval of the competent authority; and that as the matter was
        finally decided, the subsequent orders dated 06-05-2004 and 31-
        07-2004 were without jurisdiction and competence.
3.17 Thereafter, tenders were issued by the Hyderabad Urban
        Development Authority for sale of Ac.100-00 in Kokapet village
        which was part of the subject lands and Mr. Ali filed W.P. No.
        14439 of 2006 challenging the said tenders and sought a
        declaration that the said authority had no right in the property of
        the petitioners and the auction and sale process was illegal.
3.18 A learned single Judge on 14 th July, 2006 dismissed the writ
        petition ruling that under Article 226 of the Constitution an inquiry
        as to questions of title in immoveable property cannot be
        considered and observed that the petitioner may approach the
        Civil Court for appropriate declaration and injunction.

3.19 Thereagainst W.A.No. 887 of 2006 was filed by Mr. Ali. This
        appeal was dismissed by a learned Division Bench of the High
        Court, by orders dated 26-10-2007, after contest. Though, SLP
        was filed thereagainst in this Court, the writ petitioner/appellant –
        Mr. Ali sought leave to withdraw W.P.No.14439 of 2006, W.A.No.
        887 of 2006 and for rescinding the order in the writ petition and
        writ appeal. This request was granted by this Court with liberty to
        Mr. Ali to pursue “appropriate remedy”, leaving the issues open.
3.20 However, after the aforesaid order of this Court (dated 13 th
        December, 2007) several writ petitions were filed seeking reliefs
        already adverted to and these were tagged on to W.P.No. 10084
        of 2006, earlier filed by Mr. Ali and were disposed of by the
        common judgment dated 02-06-2009 by a Single Judge of the
        High Court.
    4) By the aforesaid common judgment dated 2 nd June, 2009, the
        learned single Judge invalidated the memo dated 21 st May, 2005
        on the ground that it was in violation of principles of natural justice
        and directed the State to pass fresh orders after issuing notice to
        the writ petitioners enabling the petitioners to urge all the grounds
        before the State. The order in G.O.Ms.No.1084, dated 06-06-
        2005 was upheld with a caveat that as and when rights of the
        petitioners in respect of the property in question are determined in
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                               Page 12 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        their favour they may pursue remedies in this behalf. It was
        clarified    that    the    judgment       shall not   be treated   as     a
        pronouncement or adjudication of any dispute or question
        involved in the matter and the legal representatives of Late
        Nawab Nusrat Jung Bahadur-I or their authorized agent are at
        liberty to pursue the matter with the Government; and that
        disputes, if any, among them (the legal representatives) could be
        agitated before a competent forum.
    5) Challenging the aforesaid judgment of the learned Single Judge,
        writ appeals were filed primarily by the State of Andhra Pradesh
        as well as Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority
        (HMDA). It is significant to mention that as far as appellants in
        these appeals, who claim themselves to be the legal heirs of
        Nusrat Jung-I and rightful owner of the subject lands, are
        concerned, they did not challenge the order of the Single Judge in
        respect of those findings which had been rendered against them.
        Before we take note of the salient features of the decision
        rendered by the Division Bench it would also be apposite to
        remark that the core issue is as to whether the subject lands in
        Kokapet village belong to the State or it is the purported legal
        heirs of Nusrat Jung who are entitled thereto. The chronology of
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                  Page 13 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

         events narrated above would also make it clear that the claimants
         have primarily rested their claim on the basis of the order dated
         15th February, 1954 passed by the Atiyat Court 1 which held that
         the subject lands deserved to be confirmed as Madad-e-Maash
         (grant-in-aid) in their favour. They also argued that the aforesaid
         order had been approved by the Revenue Minister on 22 nd
         December, 1954 and, thus, rights in their favour had got
         crystalised.        As per them, it is the Atiyat Court which was
         competent to decide such a dispute and once the rights of the
         appellants were recognised by the Atiyat Court, the State
         Government was bound thereby. Further submission of the
         appellants was that memos dated 21 st May, 2005 and G.O. dated
         6th June, 2005, no opportunity of hearing was given to the
         appellants and, therefore, the said memo and G.O. were violative
         of principle of natural justice (which contention was accepted by
         the learned Single Judge as well).
ISSUE BEFORE THE HIGH COURT:
    6) In the aforesaid circumstances, the Division Bench noted that the
         generic issue which fell for consideration was as to whether the
         learned Single Judge was right in invalidating the said Memo and
1                 . Through Mr. Raghupati, Advocate appearing for some of the appellants has taken
    different stance before us, which is noted later at an appropriate stage.
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                                Page 14 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        G.O., thereby directing the Government to reconsider the issue
        after affording an opportunity to the appellants herein.       It was
        because of the reason that insofar as that part of the decision of
        the learned Single Judge, rejecting substantive reliefs, namely,
        implementation of the Muntakhab, mutation of their names in the
        Revenue records; restoration of possession of the subject lands
        and declining to invalidate G.O. dated 6 th June, 2005 are
        concerned, the appellants herein never challenged that part of the
        order.
THE IMPUGNED JUDGMENT :
    7) After taking note of the aforesaid generic issue which arose for
        consideration, the High Court, at the outset, discussed the validity
        of the direction issued by the learned Single Judge directing the
        Government to reconsider the issue after giving opportunity of
        hearing to the appellants. In this behalf, it noted that the seminal
        dispute was as to whether land in-question belonged to the legal
        heirs of Nusraj Jung-I or the State. Having regard to this nature
        of dispute, the High Court has concluded that such a dispute
        cannot be decided by the Government inasmuch as deciding the
        aforesaid lis between the parties is a judicial function and such a
        judicial power, as per our constitutional scheme, rests with the
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                              Page 15 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        courts and not the Executive. Therefore, order of the learned
        Single Judge remanding the matter to the Government for de
        novo consideration was of no legal consequence.
    8) Thereafter, the High Court delineated various other issues which
        arose for consideration and discussed those issues at length and
        answered the same.             A perusal of the judgment shows that
        deliberations were undertaken on the following questions:
        (i)     What is the ‘appropriate remedy’ for Mr. Ali to pursue?
        (ii)    Whether the impugned memo dated 21 st May, 2005 is
                unsustainable for violation of principles of natural justice?
        (iii)   What was the import and effect of memos dated 15 th April,
                2002, 6th May, 2005 and 31st July, 2004 as well as
                impugned memo dated 21st May, 2005?
        (iv)    Who are the appellants?
    9) Insofar as question no. (i) is concerned, in essence, it touched
        upon the locus standi of Mr. Ali to file the writ petition. The High
        Court noted that this Court vide orders dated 13 th February, 2007
        had disposed of the Special Leave Petition filed by Mr. Ali
        permitting him to withdraw the writ petition No. 14439 of 2006
        filed by him in the High Court thereby setting aside the judgments
        of the High Court in the said writ petition as well as in the writ
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                Page 16 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        appeal no. 887 of 2006 preferred thereagainst and had accorded
        permission to Mr. Ali ‘to take appropriate remedy’.                The High
        Court thereafter proceeded to discuss what would be meant by
        such ‘appropriate remedy’ which was accorded to Mr. Ali. In this
        process, the High Court referred to and relied upon judgment of
        this Court in BSNL vs. Telephone Cables Ltd. 2l               and made the
        following remarks on the said issue:
                    “In the light of the above facts and circumstances: the
                    substantial similarity of the two writ petitions
                    (W.P.No.10084 of 2006 and 14439 of 2006); the
                    conduct of Sri Ali in having withdrawn the writ petition
                    while obtaining effacement of the elaborate and
                    painstaking judgment in the writ appeal, without
                    determination of the merits of that judgment by the
                    Supreme Court; and then pursuing W.P.No.10084 of
                    2006 (a writ petition filed earlier to W.P.No.14439 of
                    2006), constitutes in our considered view an abuse of
                    the process of law; wanton litigative behaviour,
                    pejorative to the larger public interest, involving casual
                    and reckless commandeering of scarce judicial time.
                    In the light of the observations of the Supreme Court
                    in BSNL, Sri K.S.B. Ali must be held disentitled to
                    pursue remedies under Article 226 of the Constitution
                    in respect of the grievances presented in his earlier
                    writ petition (W.P.No.14439 of 2006 and W.A.No.887
                    of 2006). We hold accordingly.”
    10)         Insofar as question no. (ii) is concerned, which discussed
        the validity of the judgment of the Single Judge holding impugned
        memo to be unsustainable for violation of principles of natural
        justice, the High Court pointed out that through this memo the
        earlier memos dated 6th May, 2004 and 31st July, 2004 were
2                (2010) 5 SCC 213
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                     Page 17 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        rescinded. However, there was no question of giving any
        opportunity of hearing to the appellant because of the reason that
        memos dated 6th May, 2004 and 31st July, 2004 remained
        uncommunicated and, thus, did not confer or create any rights in
        favour of the appellants. Consequently, these could be withdrawn
        without notice, since no rights flew from uncommunicated order.
        For arriving at this conclusion, the High Court has extensively
        dealt with the provisions of Article 166(1) of the Constitution and
        the manner in which the aforesaid provision is dealt with by this
        Court in the following judgments:
        (i)     Dattatreya Moreshwar Pangarkar vs. State of Bombay3
        (ii)    John vs. State of T.C.4
        (iii)   MRF Ltd. vs. Manohar Parrikar and others5
    11)           Relying upon the aforesaid judgments, the High Court held
        that Business Rules framed under the provisions of Article 166(3)
        of the Constitution are mandatory in nature and have to be strictly
        adhered to. The High Court also took note of another judgment
        of this Court in Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab and
        another6 , on the basis of which it concluded that merely writing
        something on the file did not amount to an order and, therefore,
3                AIR 1952 SC 181
4                (1955) 1 SCR 1011

6                AIR 1963 SC 395
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                            Page 18 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        noting in the file by the Revenue Minister, without further action
        thereupon or issuing another order in the name of the Governor,
        as required by Article 166(1) of the Constitution, did not have any
        force in law. In the process, reference was also made to another
        judgment of this Court in Shanti Sports Club and another v.
        Union of India and others7 wherein this Court held that notings
        recorded in official files by officers of the Government at different
        levels even of Ministers, do not become decisions of the
        Government unless same are sanctified and acted upon by
        issuing an order in the name of the President or the Governor as
        the case may be, authenticated in the manner provided in Articles
        77(2) and 166(2); and communicated to affected persons. The
        High Court also referred to many other judgments in support of its
        aforesaid finding.
    12)         Treating the aforesaid principle of law as binding precedents
        contained in the aforesaid judgments, the High Court concluded
        that none of the memos dated 15 th April, 2002, 6th May, 2004, 31st
        July, 2004 and 21st May, 2005 would lawfully be considered as
        constituting Executive decisions/order of the State Government
        since they were not authenticated in the manner mandated by
        Article 166 of the Constitution. Further letter dated 6 th April, 2004
7                (2009) 15 SCC 705
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                               Page 19 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        and memo dated 31st July, 2004 were, in any event, inoperable or
        inexecutable as they created no rights in favour of the appellants.
    13)         At the end, the High Court considered the status of the
        appellants while answering the question ‘who are the appellants?’
        Pointing out that all the aforesaid memos as well as impugned
        memo, flow out of representations made by Mr. Ali who claimed
        himself to be the sole representative of the legal heirs of Nusrat
        Jung-I, the High Court has examined the locus of Mr. Ali to
        espouse the cause of others and found that he could not produce
        anything on record to show as to how he was authorised to plead
        the case of the purported legal representatives or the heirs of
        Nusrat Jung-I.         The High Court further noted that other writ
        petitions were filed, by other appellants, for implementation of
        memos dated 6th May, 2004 and 31st July, 2004 which memos
        were issued only on the basis of Mr. Ali’s representation.
        Therefore, none of the other appellants could legitimately assert a
        grievance that impugned memo was issued without notice or
        opportunity to them.          According to the High Court, there was
        absence of clarity as to whether Mr. Ali and or the other writ
        petitioners were even the legal heirs of Nusrat Jung-I or were
        lawfully authorised to represent any legal heirs and, therefore,
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                              Page 20 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        none of the appellants had any locus to litigate.
    14)         After answering the questions in the manner stated above,
        the High Court has summarised the position as under:
                             “SUMMARY OF OUR CONCLUSIONS:
                   (a)     Neither the State nor any Officer of the State,
                        including the Principal Secretary or the Special
                        Chief Secretary to the Government, Revenue
                        Department is conferred judicial or quasi judicial
                        jurisdiction, power or authority, either as Court, a
                        Tribunal or a persona designata, to adjudicate
                        disputed questions of title to immovable property,
                        even where one of the competing claimants to
                        such title is the State;
                   (b) Consequent on conclusion (a) supra, none of the
                        instruments/decisions/orders dated 15-4-2002; 6-
                        5-2004; 31-7-2004, or the impugned Memo dated
                        21-5-2005 (impugned in the writ petitions), could
                        be considered as having efficacy or operative
                        force as determinative or deprivatory of title in or
                        entitlement to possession of immovable property

                        village of Ranga Reddy District, in favour of the
                        State itself or any other private individual or
                        individuals, including the writ petitioner and/or the
                        non-official respondents in this batch of writ
                        appeals;
                   (c)     The decision/order in Memos dated 06-5-2004
                        and 31-7-2004 were not formally communicated to
                        any of the writ petitioners including Sri K.S.B.Ali,

                        whose representation these Memos were issued;

                        dated       6-5-2004       and    31-7-2004,   being
                        uncommunicated administrative orders, are
                        inoperative, inexecutable and sterile;

(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

                        2002; 6-5-2004; 31-7-2004 or the impugned
                        Memo dated 21-5-2005 not having been
                        expressed or authenticated in the manner
                        ordained by Article 166 (1); or established to have
                        been decisions taken at the specified level of
                        authority, in accordance with the Rules of
                        Business issued by the Governor of the State
                        under Article 166 (2) and (3), cannot be regarded
                        as orders issued by the State in exercise of its
                        executive power under Article 162 of the
                        Constitution;
                   (f)    Consequent on conclusions (a) to (e) above, the
                        impugned Memo dated 21-5-2005 is not
                        susceptible to invalidation by this Court in
                        exercise of its power of judicial review under
                        Article 226 of the Constitution. Since the
                        impugned Memo rescinds uncommunicated and
                        inoperative Memos dated 6-5-2004 and 31-7-
                        2004, violation of the audi alterem partem
                        principle (even if applicable in the facts and
                        circumstances of the case), is of no legal
                        consequence and would not result in resuscitation
                        of the unauthorized and sterile memos dated 6-5-
                        2004 and 31-7-2004;
                   (g)     Having withdrawn W.P.No.14434 of 2006 and
                        obtained invalidation of the judgment in the said
                        writ petition and in W.A.No.887 of 2006, in SLP
                        (Civil) No. 23392 of 2007, by the order of the
                        Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 31-7-2007, while
                        obtaining permission “to take appropriate
                        remedy”, Sri K.S.B.Ali is disentitled either to file
                        another writ petition for the same relief as in
                        W.P.No. 14434 of 2006 or to pursue the pending
                        writ petition No. 10084 of 2006, as this would not
                        be an appropriate remedy; and pursuit of public
                        law remedy by Sri K.S.B.Ali, for substantially the
                        same grievance as in the earlier abandoned
                        proceedings constitutes an abuse of process of
                        the Court; and
                   (h)    Neither has Sri K.S.B.Ali established by specific
                        pleadings nor by due authorization on record that
                        he is authorized to represent the cause of 203
                        legal heirs of Nusrat Jung-I; nor have the other
                        petitioners pleaded or established the basis for

(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

                        their claims, to be the heirs of Nusrat Jung-I.
                   (i)    In view of the foregoing analyses, for the afore-
                        stated reasons and in the light of our conclusions
                        supra, the common judgment dated 02.06.2009 in
                        W.P.Nos.10084 of 2006; 22619 of 2007; 3421,
                        7747, 8761 and 12928 of 2008; 3750 and 6425 of
                        2009 is set aside and the several writ appeals are
                        allowed, with costs; and for reasons alike
                        W.P.No.29063 of 2009 is dismissed and with
                        costs.”
    15)         On behalf of the appellants, arguments were mainly
        advanced by Mr. Ali, who appeared in-person and Mr. V.N.
        Raghupathy, Advocate who argued on behalf of some other
        appellants. The entire thrust of Mr. Ali’s argument was on the
        order passed by the Atiyat Court and his submission was that as
        per these orders, the appellants were held to be owners of the
        subject lands, as legal heirs of Nusrat Jung-I. Atiyat Court was
        having requisite jurisdiction to decide this lis and its decision had
        not only attained finality, it was accepted by the Finance Minister
        as well.        Therefore, the same was binding on the State
        Government.                   Mr. Ali, in addition, submitted that special
        express powers invested in this Court to go into these issues by
        virtue of Article 323B of the Constitution. He, thus, contended
        that this Court should enforce the order of the Atiyat Court which
        was a decree under the Atiyat Act, 1952, which was a special Act
        and displaced the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.              Number of
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                    Page 23 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        judgments was cited in support of the aforesaid proposition.
    16)         Mr. Raghupati, on the other hand, argued that the inquiry
        into succession started on 7th August, 1905. This property is a
        Royal gift prior to Ashifsahi dynasty and the sale deed of 1852
        contains a recitle that this property is exclusion (Kharij – jama) for
        ever for themselves from every respect of control of Civil
        Government of Nizam ul-mulk Asif Jah on the 14 day of Jamadi-
        Al-Awal 1240 H and there is certificate for exclusion from the
        Government (Diwani) i.e. Revenue Department (Sanad-E-Mafee,
        i.e. Royal Waver (no PAC/CESS). After the demise of Nusrat
        Jung Bahadur-I, the enquiry has started on 17 th August, 1905 with
        regard to succession only. Circular 10 of 1338 Fasli came into
        force during the pendency of enquiry. It was also argued that
        according to Section 15(b) of Atiyat Enquiry Act, 1952, it is
        circular 10 of 1338 that applies to pending enquiry of Inam and
        Succession enquiry. Hence, the Atiyat Enquiry Act, 1952 has no
        application.      Under Section 9 of circular 10, the Government
        should have initiated action to avoid this Muntakhab. Since it
        failed to do so, the Muntakhab attained finality. Muntakhab was
        granted by Nazim Atiyat after obtaining approval from Revenue
        Minister under Section 8(e) of circular 10 of 1338F. Thus, the
        Muntakhab is valid document and its validity has not been
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                              Page 24 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        contested in the writ petition. It was further submitted that prior to
        Land Revenue Act, 1317, certain rules were in force which
        continued to be in force under Section 1(2) of Land Revenue Act,
        1317 Fasli.
    17)         Mr. Raghupati also submitted that temporary attachment of
        the subject lands under Section 110 of Land Revenue Act,
        1317(f) was of no consequence and it could not divest the onus
        from their ownership. He also laid stress on the approval granted
        by the Revenue Minister on the basis of which Muntakhab was
        granted. He argued that it was done after following due
        procedure. Reference was made to the judgment of this Court in
        State of Andhra Pradesh v. P. Hanumantha Rao (Dead)
        Through LRs. and others8 wherein it was held, thus:
                    “33. No doubt, it was held that neither in exercise of
                    the power of writ under Article 226 nor in supervisory
                    jurisdiction under Article 227, the High Court will
                    convert itself into a court of appeal and indulge in
                    reappreciation or evaluation of evidence. The power of
                    the High Court in writ jurisdiction to interfere where
                    important evidence has been overlooked and the legal
                    provisions involved are misinterpreted or misapplied
                    has been recognised even in the case of Sawarn
                    Singh [(1976) 2 SCC 868 : AIR 1976 SC 232] on
                    which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the
                    State. The relevant observations are:
                         “13. In regard to a finding of fact recorded by
                         an inferior tribunal, a writ of certiorari can be
                         issued only if in recording such a finding, the
                         tribunal has acted on evidence which is

                         legally inadmissible, or has refused to admit
                         admissible evidence, or if the finding is not
                         supported by any evidence at all, because in
                         such cases the error amounts to an error of
                         law.”
                                        xxx        xxx   xxx
                   35. With the growing menace of land-grabbing, the Act
                   of 1982 constitutes Special Courts and ousts
                   jurisdiction of the regular civil courts in respect of land
                   alleged to have been grabbed. Where the regular
                   remedy provided by general law is ousted by special
                   law, the provisions of the latter deserve to be
                   construed strictly. We have examined the scheme and
                   object of the Act and examined its relevant provisions.
                   When an occupant of the land is alleged to be a “land-
                   grabber”, he has to justify his possession and prove
                   his source of title. Where source of title by an
                   occupant is produced, the Special Court is required to
                   examine it to consider whether on the basis of
                   evidence of title produced by him, he can be held to
                   be not falling in the definition of “land-grabber” under
                   clause (d) of Section 2 of the Act. In the present case,
                   the occupants had produced documents to prove their
                   source of title and long possession of their
                   predecessor-in-title being the original grantee under
                   a muntakhab issued by the Ruler of the erstwhile
                   Nizam State. This title deed with revenue entries
                   based on them produced by the occupants should
                   have been treated sufficient for the purposes of the Act
                   to treat the occupants of the land to be falling outside
                   the definition of “land-grabber”. It is not a case where
                   the occupants have tried to justify their possession on
                   the basis of a mere bona fide claim to the land. They
                   have produced oral and documentary evidence on
                   the muntakhab and justified their possession as
                   alienees from the heirs of the original grantees.”
    18)         The learned counsel appealing for the State of Telangana
        and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA)
        strongly refuted the aforesaid submissions in an attempt to
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                     Page 26 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        persuade this Court to uphold the impugned judgment of the High
        Court.     It was his submission that the High Court had rightly
        questioned the locus of Mr. Ali and even before this Court, he
        could not point out as to how he was competent to espouse the
        present litigation and represent the so-called legal heirs of Nusrat
        Jung-I. It was also argued that the appellants had no right to
        even make their submissions on merits as they had not
        challenged the order of the Single Judge refusing to grant them
        relief. The issue before the Division Bench, in the appeals filed by
        the State and HMDA, only related to the directions given by the
        Single Judge to the Government to take a view after giving
        hearing to the appellants and the High Court in the impugned
        judgment had considered the aforesaid aspect, accepting the
        plea of the State and allowing its appeals. Therefore, argued the
        learned counsel, that issue decided in the impugned judgment
        could be the only subject matter of these appeals.
    19)         After considering the respective submissions, we find
        ourselves in agreement with the contentions advanced by the
        learned counsel for respondent. There are various reasons to
        dismiss these appeals, which are discussed herein below:
    20)         In the first place, it is to be noticed that as far as Mr. Ali is
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                Page 27 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        concerned, his writ petition no. 10084 of 2006 which was filed in
        the High Court after passing of the order dated 31 st July, 2007 in
        SLP(C) No. 23392 of 2007 by this Court, was not maintainable.
        This Court, by the said order, had permitted him to withdraw his
        writ petition no. 14434 of 2006 and ‘to take appropriate remedy’.
        Obviously, the remedy could not be in the form of another writ
        petition on the same facts and grounds which were pleaded
        earlier. The High Court has rightly held that having given up his
        pursuit of public law remedy in earlier abandoned proceedings,
        filing of the fresh writ petition or pursue pending writ petition no.
        10084 of 2006 would constitute an abuse of the process of the
        Court.
    21)         Secondly, the High Court is also right in holding that neither
        Mr. Ali had established by specific pleadings nor by due
        authorisation on record that he was authorised to represent the
        case of 203 legal heirs of Nusrat Jung-I.              It is clear from the
        above that insofar as Mr. Ali is concerned, his appeals are not
        even maintainable.
    22)         Thirdly, the High Court has specifically remarked, and rightly
        so, that even the other appellants did not plead or establish the
        basis of their claims that they are the heirs of Nusrat Jung-I.
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                     Page 28 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

                As pointed out above, the High Court has discussed the
        locus of these appellants (writ petitioners in the High Court) under
        the caption ‘who are the writ petitioners?’ At this juncture, it
        would be apt to reproduce the entire discussion in this behalf
        which compelled the High Court to observe that entirely chaotic
        and incoherent state of facts were pleaded by all these writ
        petitioners in their writ petition since we are in agreement with the
        High Court’s analysis. Relevant portion of the impugned
        judgment, in this behalf, is as under:
                   “There is another significant but piquant and
                   incomprehensible circumstance in this lis. The initial
                   order dated 15-04-2002, the subsequent orders dated
                   06-05-2004 and 31-07-2004 and the impugned memo,
                   all flow out of representations made by K.S.B. Ali
                   claiming to be the sole representative of the legal heirs
                   of Nusrat Jung – I.
                   The letter dated 15-04-2002 refers to W.P.No.20298 of
                   1993 filed by Mirza Agha Mohammed Ali and 169
                   others (seeking implementation of the Muntakhab).
                   These petitioners claimed to be the successors-in-
                   interest of Nusrat Jung – I. By the judgment dated 09-
                   07-2001, this Court declined to go into the details of
                   the case and directed the Government to consider the
                   report of the CLR and take further action in
                   accordance with law. The letter dated 15-04-2002 also
                   refers to a representation dated 04-08-2001 by
                   Moizuddin Mahamood (also the petitioner in
                   W.P.No.22619 of 2007); and another from K.S.B. Ali,
                   claiming to be the sole representative of the legal heirs
                   of Nusrat Jung – I. Qua this letter (dated 15-04-2002)
                   the representation of K.S.B. Ali was rejected. The
                   memo dated 06-05-2004 was issued on the basis of a
                   representation dated 06-01-2003 and further
                   representations, only by K.S.B. Ali claiming to be the
                   sole representative of the legal heirs, seeking

(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

                   implementation of the Muntakhab and reconsideration
                   of the order dated 15-04-2002. The basis for the
                   memo dated 31-07-2004 is the same as it is for the
                   memo dated 06-05-2004, i.e., representations by
                   K.S.B. Ali. It is equally not clear by what authority
                   K.S.B. Ali claimed or continues to claim, to represent
                   all the legal heirs of Nusrat Jung – I; and if he is a
                   lawfully authorized representative, whether the 170
                   petitioners (in W.P.No.20298 of 1993) are persons who
                   additionally claim to be the heirs or these petitioners
                   are renegade legal heirs who have dis-associated
                   from K.S.B. Ali. Neither a power of attorney nor an
                   authorisation signed by persons asserting to be legal
                   heirs of Nusrat Jung – I nor the names and particulars
                   of the legal heirs whose representative Sri K.S.B. Ali
                   claims to be nor even the legal basis for the claim to
                   be their representative, is on record.
                   We have earlier in the narrative herein noticed that the
                   1st defendant in O.S.No.512 of 1973 was one J.H.
                   Krishna Murthy, who in his written statement therein
                   claimed to be the GPA of the heirs of late Nusrat Jung
                   – I. In that capacity he had also though unsuccessfully
                   preferred the appeal C.C.C.A.No.142 of 1976. When
                   Sri K.S.B. Ali supplanted J.H. Krishna Murthy, as the
                   authorized legal representative of the heirs and by
                   what authority, is neither pleaded nor clarified.
                   W.P.No.9551 of 2004 was also by K.S.B. Ali claiming
                   to be the sole representative of the heirs of Nusrat
                   Jung – I. The grievance in this writ petition was non-
                   communication of the memo dated 06-05-2004 to the
                   District Collector and MRO and for implementation of
                   the order of the Atiyat Court. This writ petition was
                   disposed of at the admission stage directing
                   communication of the memo dated 06-05-2004 to
                   respondents 2 to 4 therein. Sri Ali did not plead in this
                   writ petition that the Memo dated 06-05-2004 was
                   communicated to him.
                   W.P.No.14439 of 2006 was again by K.S.B. Ali alone
                   claiming that he and a large number of (203) persons
                   are the legal heirs of Nusrat Jung – I. The proposals
                   for sale of 100 acres in Kokapet village by the HUDA
                   was challenged in this writ petition and title to the said
                   extent as part of the schedule property was claimed by
                   the petitioner K.S.B. Ali, as the sole representative of
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                    Page 30 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

                   the legal heirs of Nusrat Jung – I. On what basis Ali
                   claimed to be the heir of Nusrat Jung – I and/or to be
                   authorized to represent all the legal heirs is not clear.
                   No foundational facts are pleaded nor any material
                   furnished to infer with certitude the claim of Sri Ali to
                   represent the legal heirs of Nusrat Jung – I or the
                   claims of the other writ petitioners to being the legal
                   heirs (of Nusrat Jung – I) and hence to having a
                   litigable interest in the schedule property. Against the
                   dismissal of this writ petition (with liberty granted) to
                   pursue declaratory and injunctory reliefs before the
                   Civil Court, K.S.B.Ali preferred writ appeal No.886 of
                   2006. The appeal was dismissed by the judgment
                   dated 26-10-2007. K.S.B. Ali appealed to the Supreme
                   Court by Special Leave, pleaded for withdrawal of
                   W.P.No.14439 of 2006. By the Order of the Supreme
                   Court, dated 13-12-2007, the judgments in
                   W.A.No.887 of 2006 and W.P.No.14439 of 2006 were
                   set aside and writ petition dismissed as withdrawn; the
                   issues were left open and the appellant Ali was
                   preserved the liberty “to take appropriate remedy”.
                   Coming to the several writ petitions and the common
                   judgment therein (wherefrom the present appeals
                   arise), as already noticed, W.P.No.10084 of 2006 is
                   again by K.S.B.Ali, claiming to represent 203 legal
                   heirs of Nusrat Jung – I. W.P.No.22619 of 2007 is by
                   the sole petitioner Moizuddin Mahamood, one of the
                   representationists referred to in the order dated 15-04-
                   2002. It does not appear that the memos dated 06-05-
                   2004 and 31-07-2004 were issued on the basis of the
                   representations by this gentleman – Moizuddin
                   Mahamood. W.P.No.3421 of 2008 is by Malik Sultana
                   and 21 others; W.P.No.7747 of 2008 is by Ghouse
                   Mohiuddin Siddiqui; W.P.No.8761 of 2008 is by 13
                   petitioners; W.P.No.12928 of 2008 is by 9 petitioners;
                   W.P.No.3750 of 2009 is by 117 petitioners; and
                   W.P.No.6425 of 2009 by 20 petitioners. If K.S.B.Ali is
                   the sole representative of all the legal heirs of Nusrat
                   Jung – I, it is not clear who the other writ petitioners
                   are or on what basis they claim to be so. Except
                   K.S.B. Ali and Moizuddin Mahamood and the writ
                   petition filed by Mirza Agha Mohammed Ali and 169
                   others, there is no reference to any other claimants to
                   the schedule property even in the letter dated 5-04-
                   2002, whereby the representation of K.S.B.Ali was
                   rejected. The subsequent memos dated 06-05-2004

(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

                   and 31-07-2004 directing implementation of the
                   Muntakhab were issued only on the basis of K.S.B.
                   Ali’s representation and these orders rescinded by the
                   impugned memo dated 21-05-2005. Neither the 170
                   petitioners (whose W.P.No.20298 of 1993 was referred
                   to in the letter dated 15-04-2002) or Moizuddin
                   Mahamood whose representation dated 04-08-2001
                   was also referred to in this letter (rejecting K.S.B.Ali’s
                   representation for implementation of the Muntakhab
                   and restoration of possession of the schedule
                   property), have ever challenged the decision dated 15-
                   04-2002. Neither did Sri K.S.B. Ali.
                   Since neither the memos dated 06-05-2004 and 31-
                   07-2004 nor the re-calling of the orders in these
                   memos by the impugned memo dated 21-05-2005 is
                   at the instance of any other person except K.S.B. Ali,
                   none of the other petitioners could legitimately assert
                   a grievance that the impugned memo was issued
                   without notice or opportunity to them and on the
                   ground that any rights accrued to them under the
                   memos dated 06-05-2004 and 31-07-2004 were
                   extinguished by the impugned memo.
                   In the chaotic and incoherent state of facts adverted to
                   above and absent any clarity as to whether K.S.B.Ali
                   and/or the writ petitioners are the legal heirs of Nusrat
                   Jung – I or lawfully authorized to represent any legal
                   heirs; and since the writ petitions are founded on the
                   assertion that the reliefs claimed are on the basis that
                   the several petitioners (being successors-in-interest of
                   Nusrat Jung – I) are entitled to restoration of
                   possession of the schedule property; we do not
                   consider it prudent or pragmatic that reliefs should
                   have been granted to petitioners who have failed to
                   plead and establish any litigative interest in the subject
                   matter of the writ petitions; and therefore to a locus to
                   litigate.
    23)          Fifthly, as pointed out above, the judgment of the learned
        Single Judge insofar as it was against the appellants, was never
        challenged by them by filing any writ appeal(s).               It would be
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                    Page 32 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        pertinent to reproduce hereunder the conclusions of the learned
        Single Judge in its judgment dated 2nd June, 2009.
                    “The writ petitions were allowed with the following
                    directions:
                (a) the impugned memo dated 21-05-2005, is set aside,
                    as violative of principles of natural justice;
                (b) the Government, in its Revenue Department, shall
                    pass fresh orders, after issuing notice to the
                    petitioners. It shall be open to the petitioners to urge
                    all the grounds before the Government.
                (c)G.O.Ms.No. 1084, dated 06-06-2005, is upheld,
                    however, with a rider that as and when the rights of
                    the petitioners vis--vis the lands are determined in
                    their favour, it shall be open to them, to pursue their
                    remedies, in this regard;
                (d)This judgment shall not be treated as a
                    pronouncement or adjudication of any dispute, or
                    question, involved in the matter; and
                (e)It shall be open to the legal representatives of late
                    Nawab Nursat Jung Bahadur-1, or their authorized
                    agent, to pursue the proceedings before the
                    Government, and the dispute, if any, among them,
                    may be agitated before a competent forum.
                    As is clear from the observations set out in direction
                    (d) above, there was no adjudication or determination
                    of any of the substantive disputes between the parties,
                    particularly with regard to the vitality of the Muntakhab.
                    These disputes are relegated for de novo
                    consideration by the Government, and after notice to
                    the petitioners.”
                The learned Single Judge had specifically clarified that his
        judgment was not to be treated as a pronouncement for
        adjudication of any dispute or questions involved in the matter
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                     Page 33 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        and disputes, if any, among them could be adjudicated before a
        competent forum. In view of the above, in the appeals filed by the
        State against the judgment of the Single Judge, the Division
        Bench was only called upon to decide as to whether the direction
        to relegate the matter to the State Government was proper or not.
        The High Court has decided that aspect in the impugned
        judgment. It is obvious that the appellants cannot rake up those
        issues in these appeals which are not decided either by the
        learned Single Judge or the Division Bench.
    24)         Sixthly, Insofar as the decision of the Division Bench on the
        issue raised before it is concerned, no arguments were even
        advanced by the appellants questioning the validity thereof. Even
        otherwise, having gone through the said judgment minutely, we
        are in complete agreement with the impugned judgement on
        those aspects, decided by the High Court. To recapitulate in brief
        it is stated that even the writ petition filed by the petitioners herein
        (writ petition no. 3421 of 2008) which inter alia sought to
        challenge memo dated 21st May, 2005 issued by the Revenue
        Department as illegal and also sought to implement Muntakhab
        No. 55 of 1955 dated 7th May, 1955, by mutating the names of the
        petitioners in the Revenue Records and return the custody of the
Civil Appeal Nos. 15571-15572 of 2017                                 Page 34 of 36
(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

        property was clearly not maintainable for two reasons. Insofar
        the memo dated 21st May, 2005, was concerned, the main
        grievance of the writ petitioners appears to be that the same had
        been passed without giving any notice to the writ petitioner and
        that the same could not have reviewed/rescinded the memos
        dated 6th May, 2004. The said arguments are not tenable on
        account of the fact that the impugned memo dated 21 st May,
        2005, only sought to reinforce the memo dated 15 th April, 2002,
        issued by the Government in response to the representation
        made by Mr. Ali. Therefore, when the impugned memo dated 21 st
        May, 2005 was admittedly not issued at the instance of the writ
        petitioners there could not have been any question of hearing
        them prior to the same. Further, neither the impugned memo nor
        the memo dated 6th May, 2004 (purporting to create rights in
        favour of the legal heirs of Nawab Nusrat Jung-I) was
        communicated to the writ petitioners.              Hence, insofar as the
        memo dated 21st May, 2005 is concerned, no cause of action
        accrued in favour of the writ petitioners to have approached the
        High Court and, therefore, the only person, if any, who could have
        challenged the same was Mr. Ali. As far as Mr. Ali, is concerned,
        as already pointed above, he could not maintain the writ petition
        as it was not ‘appropriate remedy’ as granted by this Court.

(arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 18755-18756 of 2013 – BATCH MATTERS)

    25)         For all these reasons, these appeals are dismissed.
        However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, we may
        refrain from awarding any costs.
