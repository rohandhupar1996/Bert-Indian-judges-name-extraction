2.     The brief facts, giving rise to the filing of these writ petitions, may
be noticed as follows :-
       I.      The respondent No.4 i.e. the Deputy Commissioner,
       Sivasagar District had issued a Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT)
       dated 03.07.2014 for settlement of the Brahmaputra Part-II
       Fishery located in the Sivasagar district for a period of seven
       years. The Government value of annual revenue for the fishery
       for the first year was shown as Rs.4,67,500/- in the NIT. The NIT
       dated 03.07.2014 had inter-alia mentioned that it was a 60%
       fishery to be settled with societies consisting of 100% Scheduled
       Caste/Maimal Community of actual fishermen who fulfill the
       conditions laid down in the NIT.
        II.    In response to the said NIT, as many as 8(eight) bidders
       including the writ petitioner society herein had submitted their
       bids. Upon opening the bids, the respondent No.4 had prepared
       a comparative statement (CS) which was forwarded to the
       Government for necessary action. As per the comparative
       statement, one Bipul Hazarika, Secretary of Natun Gatenga
       Pankajyoti Self Help (SH) Group had offered the highest price of
       Rs.50,00,599/- whereas the offer made by the writ petitioner for
       an amount of Rs.33,23,501/- was the second highest. The
       respondent No.5 had quoted Rs.12,05,000/- and had emerged
       as the fifth highest bidder. Despite the fact that the rate quoted
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                                   Page 2 of 17

       by the petitioner was nearly three times the offer made by the
       respondent No.5, yet, by the impugned order dated 05.11.2014,
       the respondent authority had settled the aforesaid fishery in
       favour of respondent No.5 for a yearly revenue of Rs.12,05,000/-.
       Aggrieved, the petitioner society had approached this Court by
       filing WP(C) No.5734/2014 assailing the order of settlement
       dated 05.11.2014.
        III. While issuing notice, this court had passed an interim order
       dated 10.11.2014 in WP(C) No.5734/2014 directing status quo to
       be maintained as regards the process of settlement of the
       Brahmaputra Part-II Fishery. In view of the interim order dated
       10.11.2014, the settlement awarded in favour of the respondent
       No.5 could not be given effect to as a result of which, the Circle
       Officer, Sivasagar, had issued an order dated 01.03.2014
       permitting the respondent No.5 to temporarily operate the
       fishery on payment of Rs.1165/- as daily revenue.
        IV.    The aforesaid action on the part of the Circle Officer had
       prompted the writ petitioner to once again approach this Court
       by filing WP(C) No.6308/2014 assailing the order of temporary
       settlement dated 01.03.2014. Taking note of the grievance of
       the writ petitioner, this Court had passed an order dated
       09.12.2015 suspending the operation of the order dated
       01.03.2014 issued by the Circle Officer, Sivasagar      and liberty
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                               Page 3 of 17

       was given to the settling authority to allow the writ petitioner to
       operate the fishery on payment of a daily collection of Rs.8000/-
       which amount was found to be commensurate with the annual
       price offer of Rs.33,23,501/-    made by writ petitioner in the
       tender process. Accordingly, the writ petitioner was allowed to
       temporarily operate the fishery on a daily basis, against
       collection of a toll of Rs.8000/- per day until 18.10.2016 i.e. the
       date on which the aforesaid settlement was cancelled on the
       ground of non-payment of the outstanding dues.
3.     Referring to the documents available on record Mr. Sarma,
learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that as per the CS prepared
on 06.09.2014, the bid submitted by the writ petitioner was initially
found    to   be    technically deficient  on  three   counts,   viz.,   (1)
neighbourhood certificate was not given by the Circle Officer; (2)
revenue offered is highly exorbitant; and (3) the father of the secretary
of the petitioner society has been held to be a defaulter while he was
functioning as a member of another society. However, submits Mr.
Sarma, a perusal of the impugned order dated 05.11.2014 would go to
show that the Government has rejected the bid of the writ petitioner
on altogether different grounds. Inviting the attention of the court to
the order dated 05.11.2014, Mr Sarma submits that the grounds stated
therein mentions that the writ petitioner did not submit fishing
experience certificate, balance-sheet and neighbourhood certificate
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                               Page 4 of 17

but in reality,        two neighbourhood certificates issued by the
concerned Gaonburah and the President of the Gaon Panchayat
had been submitted by the petitioner along with the tender. That
apart, submits Mr. Sarma, a certificate issued by the District Fishery
Development        Officer    (DFDO) Sivasagar,  regarding   the   fishing
experience of the members of the petitioner            society was also
enclosed with the tender document. The learned counsel submits that
as per the NIT conditions there was no need for submission of balance-
sheet and the fact that Ananda Hazarika, i.e. the father of the
secretary of the petitioner society, was adjudged as a defaulter, while
he was a member of another society, cannot have any bearing in the
present tender process. As such, the bid of the writ petitioner,
according to Mr. Sarma, could not have been held to be technically
defective.
5.      Coming to the issue of the high price quoted by the petitioner,
Mr. Sarma submits that the purpose of floating a tender was to secure
the highest revenue against the settlement of the fishery. The
petitioner had quoted high price so as to increase its chances of
success in the tender process. As such, the respondents were not
justified in rejecting the bid of the petitioner on the ground that the
offer made was exorbitantly high, more so, when there is no provision
in the NIT or the Rules permitting the respondents to reject any bid on
such ground.
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                              Page 5 of 17

6.      By placing reliance on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of Dutta Associates Pvt. Ltd. vs. Indo Merchantiles
Pvt. Ltd. and others reported in (1997)1 SCC 53, Mr. Sarma submits that
the concept of viability range in matters of Government contract has
been rejected by the Apex Court in the said decision and law is now
well settled that the tendering authorities cannot apply such criteria of
viability range after opening the bids so as to eliminate higher price
offers made by the eligible tenderers. In the present case, submits Mr.
Sarma, the records would establish beyond doubt that the bid
submitted by the petitioner society was in accordance with the tender
conditions and hence, the same could not have been rejected by the
authorities in such an arbitrary fashion so as to award the settlement in
favour of the 5th highest bidder i.e. the respondent No.5 at a much
lower price.
7.      The learned Government Advocate, Assam has produced the
records and has made submissions to defend the impugned order
dated 05.11.2014 by stating that the tendering authorities are the best
judge to ascertain whether a particular price offered is viable or not. In
the present case, the offer made by the first three bidders including
the writ petitioner was several times higher than the revenue
generated in the previous settlement years and hence, taking note of
the ground realities, the Government took the decision not to settle
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                              Page 6 of 17

the fishery with such bidders so as to avoid legal proceedings in future
pertaining to recovery of Government dues. By referring to a decision
of this Court rendered in the case of M/S Utkal Galvanizers Ltd. vs. The
State of Assam and others reported in (2012) 5 GLT 775, Mr. Nath,
submits that a decision as to the feasibility of the price offer made by
the bidders was taken by the departmental authorities on assessment
of the ground realities and this Court, in exercise of power of judicial
review, would not interfere with the said decision and substitute its own
opinion in the matter.
8.      Mr. B. Gogoi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent
No.5, has supported the arguments advanced by the learned
Government        Advocate      and has  further   submitted     that    the
departmental authorities had taken a conscious decision not to settle
the fishery with the bidders quoting     abnormally high price only to
obtain the order of settlement despite knowing fully well that they will
not be able to meet the Government revenue demand once the
settlement is given. The assessment of the departmental authorities, in
so far as the writ petitioner is concerned, according to Mr. Gogoi,
turned out to be correct in view of the default committed by the
petitioner society in paying the revenue in respect of the daily
settlement granted in its favour at the same offered rate which works
out to Rs.8000/- per day. Mr. Gogoi submits that the writ petitioner
society is a defaulter and there are Bakijai proceedings pending
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                               Page 7 of 17

against it for recovery of substantial amount of Government dues.
Under the circumstances, the decision of the departmental authorities
cannot be found fault with. In support of his aforesaid argument the
learned counsel has relied upon the decision in the case of Jagadish
Mandal vs. State of Orissa and others, reported in (2007) 14 SCC 517 to
argue that the power of judicial review may not be exercised to
protect private interest at the cost of public interest or to decide
contractual disputes. He submits that the impugned decision has been
taken by the Government bonafide and in public interest and hence,
the same does not call for any interference from this Court.
9.     I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel
for the parties and have also gone through the materials available on
record.
10.    As noted above, the NIT dated 03.07.2014 clearly lays down the
conditions that the bidders would have to fulfill so as to be eligible to
participate in the tender process. Clause 19 of the NIT dated
03.07.2014 inter alia, mentions that the tenderer shall have to submit
actual fishermen certificate and caste certificate. From the record I
find that the writ petitioner society had submitted certificate issued by
the DFDO in support of its claim that the members of the petitioner
society belong to the scheduled caste fishermen community.
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                              Page 8 of 17

11.      Rule 12 of the Assam Fishery Rules, 1953 mandate that a 60%
category fishery shall be settled with cooperative societies, non-
Governmental organizations and self-help groups consisting of 100%
actual fishermen in the neighbourhood of the fishery concerned by
the tender system. The Fishery Rules, however, does not indicate as to
who would be the competent authority to issue such neighbourhood
certificate. A scrutiny of the NIT dated 03.07.2014 also goes to show
that nothing has been mentioned therein as to who would be the
competent authority to issue a neighbourhood certificate.
12.      Record reveals that the writ petitioner society has submitted
neighbourhood certificates issued by the concerned “Gaonburah”
and also the President of the Gaon Panchayat. The authenticity of
those certificates are not in dispute       nor is it the case of the
respondents that the petitioner society does not belong to the
neighbourhood of the fishery. Under the circumstances, the stand of
the respondent authorities to the effect that the petitioner society did
not submit a valid fishing experience certificate and neighbourhood
certificate merely because the same is not issued by the Circle Officer,
does not appear to be correct on the face of the record.
13.         As regards the objection pertaining to non-submission of
balance-sheet, it is seen from the record that the NIT does not stipulate
any such requirement. In the case of Raja Das vs.        Assam Fisheries
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                             Page 9 of 17

Devp. Corpn. And others reported in 2005(3) GLT 544 this court has
held that a tender can be declared as invalid only if it violates the
tender conditions. Applying the ratio of the said decision, it is held that
since there was no requirement to furnish balance sheet under the NIT,
the same cannot be a ground for declaring the bid as invalid.
14.         Although there is an observation made in the comparative
statement regarding the default status of the father of Rubul Hazarika
i.e. the secretary of the petitioner society, yet, it appears from the
order dated 05.11.2014 that the same is not a ground on which the
petitioner’s bid had been rejected. The learned Government
Advocate has also fairly submitted that no such ground was available
for rejection of the petitioner’s bid. In view of the above, this Court
need not go into the said aspect of the matter.
15.    The findings and observations made herein before would go to
show that the tender submitted by the petitioner was compliant with
the terms of the NIT as well as the provision of Rule 12 of the Assam
Fishery Rules, 1953 and as such the bid of the petitioner society could
not have been rejected on the ground of any technical defect.
16.    Coming to the issue of exorbitant price quoted by the bidders,
a perusal of the impugned order dated 05.11.2014 indicates that the
bids of as many as three bidders i.e. the H1, H2 and H3 were rejected on
the ground that the price quoted by those tenderers were exorbitantly
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                               Page 10 of 17

high. The writ petitioner, being the second highest (H2) bidder, has
assailed the impugned order dated 05.11.2014 contending that such
conclusion of the authorities was without any basis and therefore, was
wholly arbitrary and illegal.
17.    From the materials available on record, I find that the NIT dated
03.07.2014 did not contain any condition to indicate that bids quoting
high price shall be rejected. A scrutiny of the records produced by the
learned Government counsel also goes to show that there was no
decision taken by the tendering authority before opening of the bids
to reject any offer found to be abnormally high nor was there any
conscious decision on as to what amount would be regarded as
“abnormally high price”. A reading of the impugned order goes to
show that the price offered by the three bidders i.e. H1, H2 and H3 had
been rejected on an assessment made by the respondent authorities
that the offers made by them were not viable and would inevitably
lead to default.
18.        The Assam Fishery Rules, 1953 requires that a 60% category
fishery should be settled through a tender process. The very idea
behind floating a tender is to select the most eligible bidder making
the highest offer. Ensuring highest revenue against the settlement of
the fishery is, therefore, undoubtedly the primary objective of the
tender process. In the case of Jespar I. Slong vs. State of Meghalaya and
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                               Page 11 of 17

others, reported in (2004) 11 SCC 485 the Hon’ble Supreme Court has
observed that obtaining higher revenue by accepting the highest bid
would only be in the public interest because the State would gain
more revenue from it.
19.       While it may be true that there may be bidders         offering
exorbitant price so as to grab the settlement only to subsequently end
up as defaulter and to that extent, it cannot be denied that the
tendering authorities must have the           liberty to eliminate such
superficial bidders. But such process of elimination must be fair and
transparent whereby, the bidders are notified before the submission of
the bids as to the criteria that would be followed for evaluation of the
price bids. If the authorities are of the view that the predatory price
offers should be discouraged and such bids should be eliminated at
the threshold, there is nothing preventing them from incorporating
suitable clauses in the NIT providing for the same. The authorities may
even impose stringent default conditions in the NIT so as to act as a
deterrent for such bidders quoting un-realistic prices. That apart, the
option of insisting on additional security from the successful bidder if
the price is found to be abnormally high, is also available to the
authorities by making suitable provision in the NIT.
20.    Under the existing system, possibility of default cannot be ruled
out in case of any bidder, regardless of the price offered. There are
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                              Page 12 of 17

adequate legal remedies, including the option of bakijai cases,
available to the State to recover the dues from such defaulters. But to
reject a bid for reasons not disclosed in the NIT would be totally
impermissible. Once a tender is floated for settlement of the fishery,
the government would also be equally bound by the NIT conditions
and therefore, once the bids are opened, it would be wholly
impermissible for the authorities to arbitrarily reject the higher offers on
a mere speculation that such price offers would not be viable. It must
be borne in mind that in fishery settlement tenders the bidders are all
experienced fishermen who have a fairly good assessment as regards
the financial implications of the price offered. Despite the same, if a
bidder ends up quoting an abnormally high price, he does so at his
own peril and the respondents cannot reject such an offer merely on
an assumption, howsoever strong it may be, that the bidder will end
up being a defaulter. Permitting such a recourse would, in the opinion
of this court, not only afford potential ground for favoritism leading to
pre-settlement litigation amongst the bidders but would also stand to
frustrate the very purpose of inviting the tenders.
21.    In a recent decision of this court in the case of Gangadhar
Fishery Co. Op. Society Ltd. vs. the State of Assam & others [WP(C)
No.904/2016], while interpreting Rule 12 of the Assam Fishery Rules,
1953 this court had made the following observations :-
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                                 Page 13 of 17

               “33.     A perusal of the aforementioned Rules would go to
               show that the same has a benevolent object which is to
               promote the interest of the group of people mentioned
               therein. Proviso to Rule 12, therefore, clearly enjoins a duty
               upon the Government to take proper care that the 60%
               category Fishery is settled with the special category of co-
               operative societies mentioned there-in. Unlike in the case
               of an open commercial tender, in case of settlement of a
               fishery under the Rules, there is a statutory duty cast upon
               the Government to ensure that the objective of the
               Fishery Rules is realized in its letter and spirit. In doing so, it
               would not only be open but also incumbent upon the
               Government to make such relevant enquiries so as to
               reach a satisfaction that not only the most deserving
               group is conferred with the settlement but also to ensure
               that the interest of government revenue is adequately
               protected. Therefore, subject to fulfillment of the NIT
               conditions, the price offered by the highest bidder must
               receive utmost priority and should normally be accepted,
               unless there are very good and compelling reasons to
               deviate therefrom. As long as the authorities provide a
               level playing field to all the bidders, mere technical
               defects not affecting the substance of the tender should
               not be permitted to defeat the underlying objective of
               the Fishery Rules.”
22.    From the above, it would be apparent that once it is found that
the bidder has fulfilled all the requirements of the NIT the departmental
authorities would be under a legal obligation to accept the highest
offer since such a decision would be in the interest of the State and
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                                      Page 14 of 17

therefore, in public interest. Although heavy reliance has been placed
by Mr. Gogoi on the decision of the Supreme Court rendered in the
case of Jagadish Mandal (supra), yet, I find that that was a case
where the Hon’ble Supreme Court had taken a view in the matter by
relying upon the opinion expressed by the expert committee which
was specifically constituted for the purpose. But in this case there is no
such expert opinion available to support the impugned decision and
therefore, the ratio of the said decision would not be applicable in the
facts of the present case.
 23.         The plea of the respondents that the writ petitioner is a
defaulter and therefore, cannot be granted settlement of the fishery
can also not be accepted by this court on account of the fact that
those are developments that took place on subsequent dates and
record reveals that those issues are subjudice in W.P. (c) No 7481 /
2016 and W.P.(c) No. 2720 of 2016 pending before this court.
24.       It is settled law that In the matter of government contract, the
court would examine the decision making process but not the merit of
the decision. For the reasons stated above, this court is of the
considered opinion that the impugned decision to reject the higher
price offered by the bidders suffers from the vice of total non-
transparency and therefore, is vitiated by complete arbitrariness. The
same is accordingly declared as illegal and un-sustainable in law.
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                               Page 15 of 17

25.    There is another aspect of the matter which deserves mention
herein. The bid of the fourth highest bidder quoting a price of
Rs.15,25,999/- was also refused by the order dated 05.11.2014 on
grounds which are not tenable on the face of the record. In the order
dated 05.11.2014, although it has been mentioned that the fourth
highest bidder had not submitted fishing experience certificate, yet,
from the record, I find that a fishing experience certificate dated
15.07.2014 issued by the DFDO produced by the said bidder is
available on record. If the bid of the fourth respondent was otherwise,
technically valid, the settlement order could not have been issued in
favour of the respondent No.5 by ignoring the higher price offered by
the H4, which offer was admittedly found to be acceptable by the
authorities.
26.       Coming to the question of relief that can be granted in this
case, this court has noticed that the highest bidder quoting the price
of Rs 50,00,599/- is not a party to this proceedings. In the absence of
the highest bidder, no writ of mandamus can be issued in favour of
the petitioner. That apart, the NIT was also issued on 03.07.2014 i.e.
more than two years back and considerable amount of time has
elapsed since then. Such being the position, while setting aside the
settlement made in favour of respondent No.5, the matter is
remanded back to the authorities to take a fresh decision on the
WP(C) Nos.5734/2014 & 6308/2014                              Page 16 of 17

question of granting permanent settlement of the fishery, in the light of
the observations made herein above.
 WP(C) No.5734/2014 stands allowed to the extent indicated above.
 In view of the observations made herein above, WP(C) No.6308/2014
stands disposed of.
    Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, there
