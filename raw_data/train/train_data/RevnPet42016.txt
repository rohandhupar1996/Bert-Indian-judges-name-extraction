                               Revision Petition No.4 of 2016
                             BEFORE
      HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
         HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
8.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
       Mr.RK Joshi, learned counsel for the petitioners.
       Mr. D Saikia, learned Senior Additional Advocate General,
       Assam     assisted    by   Mr.B    Choudhdury,      learned
       Government Advocate for the respondents.
       This revision petition is directed against the judgment
dated 3.4.2014 passed by the Assam Board of Revenue,
Guwahati,    whereby     it  has  dismissed    petitioners’   Case
No.77STA/2013.
       The first petitioner is an assessee under the Central
Sales Tax Act, 1956 (in short 'the CST Act') and also under the
Assam Value Added Tax Act, 2007 (in short 'the VAT Act'). For
the stock transfer of black tea by the assessee, they claimed
tax exemption under Section 6(A) of the CST Act and through
the original assessment order dated 23.8.2011, the Assessing
Officer after scrutinizing the Form-'F' declarations produced by
the assessee, granted the exemption benefit under Section 6(A)
to the tune of Rs.3,37,46,239/-. But later, the assessment was
re-opened on the ground that the turnover escaped assessment
and, therefore, steps were taken under Section 40 of the VAT
Act read with Section 9(2) of the CST Act to recover additional
tax. Ultimately, order of re-assessment dated 9.4.2013 was
passed against the assessee.
       It is argued on behalf of the assessee/petitioners that
although it is obligatory under Section 40 of the VAT Act read
                                                        Page 1 of 2

with Rule 25 of the VAT Rules for giving an opportunity of
hearing by issuing a notice, no such notice was, in fact, given
by the Assessing Officer before passing the re-assessment
order.
       We also find that there is no reliable material to indicate
that an opportunity of hearing was given to the assessee/
petitioners as required under Section 40 of the VAT Act read
with Rule 25 of the VAT Rules before passing of the re-
assessment     order    dated   9.4.2013.    Therefore,   the   re-
assessment order dated 9.4.2013 passed by the Assessing
Officer as well as the impugned judgment dated 3.4.2014
passed in appeal by the Assam Board of Revenue, Guwahati
cannot be sustained. We, accordingly, quash both these orders
and remand the matter to the Assessing Officer to decide the
same      afresh,    after    serving    statutory    notice    on
assessee/petitioners.
       The revision petition is allowed to the above extent.
          JUDGE                               CHIEF JUSTICE
