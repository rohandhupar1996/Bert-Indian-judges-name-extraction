        KURIAN, J.:
                           Leave granted.
                  2.   Appellants are before this Court aggrieved by the
                       impugned Judgment dated 10.08.2016 by the High Court.
                       The High Court upheld the order passed by the Central
                       Administrative      Tribunal,    Calcutta    to  reinstate the
                       respondent in service with back wages from the date of
                       termination. In the nature of the order we propose to pass,
                       it is not necessary to go into the factual matrix.
                  3.   Thanks to the gracious cooperation extended by the
