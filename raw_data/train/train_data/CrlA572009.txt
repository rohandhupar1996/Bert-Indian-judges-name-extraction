        Date of hearing & Judgment         : 25.07.2017
                        JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
        This is an appeal, against the judgment, passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge (FTC) No. 2, Kamrup (M), Guwahati, in Criminal Appeal No.
75/2006, allowing the appeal filed by the respondent against the judgment and
order dated 30.11.2006, passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate
No. 2, Kamrup (M), Guwahati, in CR Case No. 869C/2004 convicting the
                                                                        Page 1 of 5

accused appellant under Section 138/142 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, and
sentencing him to pay the cheque amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- together with a sum
of Rs. 50,000/- as interest and the cost of the litigation, in default to suffer
Simple Imprisonment for 1 (one) year.
2)      The case of the present appellant is that he filed the case No. 869C/2004
under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, against the respondent No.
1 of this petition on the facts that the present respondent No. 1 borrowed an
amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- from the present appellant and issued cheque on
2.4.2004 in discharge of his liability for payment of the borrowed amount of Rs.
1,00,000/-.    The cheque was drawn in the Pragjyotish Gaoliya Bank, Fancy
Bazar, Guwahati. He deposited the cheque on 27.4.2004 with his Bank, i.e.
Allahabad Bank, Lakhtokia Branch, for collection. But, on 29.4.2004, he was
informed by the bank, vide Memo dated 28.4.2004 that the banker of the
accused respondent, returned the cheque dishonored on the ground “insufficient
fund”. Thereafter, on 1.5.2005, the present appellant complainant sent a notice
to the accused respondent demanding payment of the cheque amount by currier
service and despite receipt of the notice aforesaid, the accused respondent failed
to discharge his liability/debt by making payment of the aforesaid amount.
Hence the case.
3)      The learned trial court, after full trial of the case in accordance with the
procedure prescribed by law, delivered the judgment, convicting the accused
                                                                           Page 2 of 5
Crl.A.57/2009

respondent No. 1, vide judgment in CR Case No. 869C/2004 convicting and
sentencing the accused respondent as indicated above.
4)      Against this judgment of the learned trial court of Sub-Divisional Judicial
Magistrate (S) No. 2, Guwahati, the accused respondent preferred an appeal
before the learned Additional Sessions Judge No. 2, Kamrup (M), Guwahati, vide
Criminal Appeal No. 75/2006. The learned trial court, vide the judgment dated
10.9.2007, passed in the aforesaid criminal appeal, reversed the order of
conviction and sentence by the learned trial court and acquitted the accused
respondent.
5)      I have perused the judgment, passed by the learned trial court as well as
the judgment, passed by the learned appellate court of Additional Sessions Judge
No. 2, Kamrup (M), Guwahati.           It appears from the impugned appellate
judgment, dated 10.9.2007, that the appellate court recorded almost all the
findings recorded by the learned trial court except the factum of service of notice
upon the accused respondent as correct.        The learned lower appellate court
appears to have referred to Ext.4, the Office copy of the notice, sent by the
present appellant to the accused respondent on 1.5.2004 through currier service.
Ext.5, as appears from the judgment, is the receipt issued by the currier service
indicating receipt of the notice by the currier service for dispatching the same to
the accused respondent.      Ext.6 is the receipt of the notice by the accused
respondent. The learned lower appellate court has referred to Ext.6 and stated
in the judgment impugned that the Ext.6, notice, was not received directly by
                                                                          Page 3 of 5
Crl.A.57/2009

the accused respondent and somebody else received the same for him who is not
proved to be either his employee or power of attorney holder.
6)      The learned counsel for the present appellant before this court has
submitted that once the notice sent, receipt thereof is not required to be proved
by the complainant appellant. The learned counsel for the present appellant has
also referred to a decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of C.C. Alvai
Haji –vs- Palapetty Muhammed reported in (2007) 6 Supreme Court Cases 555,
and submitted that in the event the accused respondent did not receive the
notice, he ought to have approached the court, on his appearance, showing that
he did not receive notice which the accused respondent did not do in the instant
case.   Therefore, the receipt of notice, when dispatched in appropriate manner,
cannot be taken to negate the claim of the appellant complainant as has been
done in the instant case.
7)      On consideration of the facts of the case, reading both the judgments of
the trial court and the lower appellate court of Additional Sessions Judge, and on
reading the materials available before this court, this court is of the considered
view that the question of notice, as indicated above, is required to be re-looked
into by the learned lower appellate court and to record a finding about the
validity of service of notice as per the law as was prevailing at that point of time.
8)      In view of the above, the appeal is remanded back to the learned Sessions
Judge with a direction to hear both the parties on the issue of service of notice as
                                                                           Page 4 of 5

indicated in the foregoing paragraphs and to decide the issue and dispose of the
appeal afresh.
9)      The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
10)     Send back the LCR along with copy of this judgment.
                                                                    JUDGE
