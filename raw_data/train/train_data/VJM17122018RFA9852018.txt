RFA No. 985/2018                                             Page 3 of 17

from his self earned money in the year 1965-66.          It was further
pleaded that the father, Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri, had started trading of
phenyl goli in the name of M/s. Puri Sales Corporation, and this
business was run out of a tenanted shop no. 90, Swadeshi Market,
Sadar Bazar, Delhi – 110006. From the earnings of the business and

also prayed for the plaintiff.

RFA No. 985/2018                                          Page 4 of 17

by defendant no. 1/brother now represented by respondents no. 1(a) to
(c).   He pleaded that the suit properties were the self-acquired
properties of the father, Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri. It was also pleaded
that Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri had executed in favour of the defendant no.
1/Late Sh. Madan Lal Puri his registered Will dated 14.09.1977
bequeathing thereby the properties of the father Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri
to the defendant no. 1/Late Sh. Madan Lal Puri. It was also pleaded
that the plaintiff/Late Sh. Charanjit Lal Puri had left the family long
back in the year 1977. The plaintiff/Late Sh. Charanjit Lal Puri was a
partner in the partnership which was dissolved on 28.02.1977 when
plaintiff/ Late Sh. Charanjit Lal Puri settled his account and walked
out of the partnership through the Dissolution Deed dated 28.02.1977.
The father, Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri, at that time had given to the
plaintiff/Late Sh. Charanjit Lal Puri a sum of Rs. 10,000/- by grace
and the plaintiff/ Late Sh. Charanjit Lal Puri had given in writing that
he would no longer have any claim to the properties of the father, Late
Sh. Ram Lal Puri. It is also pleaded that the father had created a tape
recording of his Will dated 14.09.1977, and this tape recording was
recorded on 22.09.1979. The father, Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri had also,
RFA No. 985/2018                                          Page 5 of 17

on the same date being 22.09.1979, written his note of the execution
of the Will in Urdu in his handwriting. Defendant no. 1/ Late Sh.
Madan Lal Puri is therefore claimed to be the sole owner of the suit
property and has thus prayed for dismissal of the suit.

        identified the signatures of Sh. Ram Lal Puri at point Y1 to Y6. He was
        cross examined.”
5.      The main issue which was argued before this Court on behalf of
the appellants/plaintiff was as to whether or not the father, Late Sh.
Ram Lal Puri, died leaving behind his Registered Will dated
14.09.1977. This was the subject matter of issue no. 4 framed by the
trial court. The trial court has held this issue in favour of the defendant
no. 1/Late Sh. Madan Lal Puri by holding that the Will has been
proved through the Advocate, Sh. S.C. Nigam, who deposed as DW-5
that he had drafted the said Will and was also present at the time of
RFA No. 985/2018                                                  Page 9 of 17

execution and attestation of the Will. One of the attesting witnesses to
the Will was Sh. Jagdish Lal Jain who had expired, and the signatures
of Late Sh. Jagdish Lal Jain on the Will as an attesting witness were
proved through the son of Late Sh. Jagdish Lal Jain namely, Sh.
Mahinder Pal Jain, who deposed as DW-2 besides such attestation
being proved through Sh. S.C. Nigam, Advocate deposing as DW-5.
This Court notes that when the attesting witness has expired, a Will
can be proved in accordance with Section 69 of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872 by proving that the attestation of atleast one attesting
witness is in the handwriting/signature of the attesting witness.
Nothing adverse to the case of defendant no. 1/Late Sh. Madan Lal
Puri was elucidated in the cross-examinations of Sh. Mohinder Nath
Uppal who deposed as DW-1 and Sh. S.C. Nigam who deposed as
DW-5. The Will in the own voice of the deceased father, Sh. Ram Lal
Puri, was recorded by a tape recorder on 22.09.1979 and was proved
in terms of a tape recorded cassette Ex. DW-1/3. The writing in Urdu
of Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri stating about the execution of the Will in his
own handwriting was proved as Ex. DW-1/4. The trial court has also
noted that the Will Ex. DW-1/D-1 dated 14.09.1977 (also proved as
RFA No. 985/2018                                          Page 10 of 17

Ex. DW-3/3) was more than 30 years old at the time when it was
tendered in evidence and therefore there is a presumption to its
validity under Section 90 of the Indian Evidence Act. The trial court,
accordingly, held that the registered Will dated 14.09.1977, Ex. DW-
1/D-1 (also proved as Ex. DW-3/3) stands proved. The relevant paras
of the judgment of the trial court in this regard are paras 53 to 57, and
these paras read as under:-
       “ISSUE No. 4: Whether Sh. Ram Lal executed a legal and valid Will
       dated 14.09.1977 in favour of the defendant No. 1? if yes, its effect?
       OPD
       53. Onus to prove this issue is upon the defendant. In order to prove the
       Will dt 14.09.1977 Ex DW3/3 (also exhibited as DW1/D1). Plaintiff (sic:
       Defendant) examined Shri Mohinder Nath Uppal as DW1, Mahinder Pal
       Jain S/o of the attesting witness namely Shri Jagdish Lal Jain as DW2 and
       Shri S. C. Nigam Advocate who drafted the Will in question as DW5.
       54. DW5 Shri S.C. Nigam in his examination -in-chief deposed that he
       drafted the said Will and it bear his signature as its draftsman. He further
       deposed that Will was executed in his presence and in the presence of
       witnesses. He identified the signatures of late Shri Ram Lal Puri on all the
       five page of the document. In cross examination he deposed that when the
       Will was finalised and executed Ram Lal Puri was accompanied by
       somebody beside the witness who attested the same. He further deposed
       that he could not say if Ram Lal Puri was under any pressure of the
       witnesses brought by him for execution of the Will. He denied the
       suggestion that he did not draft the Will on the instruction of Late sh. Ram
       Lal Puri or that the Will Ex DW1/D1 was not signed by the witnesses and
       Ram Lal Puri in his presence. Thus, the suggestion that Will was not
       signed by witnesses and Ram Lal Puri in his presence involves the
       admission of the plaintiff that it bears the signatures of Ram Lal Puri and
       witnesses and what is disputed is the presence of DW5. Moreover, there is
       no suggestion that he did not draft the Will at all or he had not signed the
       said Will on the day of execution or that he was in collusion with any of
       the defendants or that he signed the Will at later date to help defendants.
RFA No. 985/2018                                                    Page 11 of 17

     Plaintiff did not give any suggestion as to who instructed DW5 to draft
     Will if the Will was not drafted on the instruction of Ram Lal Puri. Thus, it
     stands proved that Will was drafted by him on the instruction of Late Sh.
     Ram Lal Puri, that he signed the same on the day of execution, that Ram
     Lal Puri and witnesses signed the Will and that he was not in collusion
     with any of the defendants.
     55. DW2 is the son of Jagdish Lal Jain who is the attesting witness to the
     Will Ex DW1/D1. He deposed that his father expired on 11.11.1987. He
     identified the writing and signatures of his father from point 'A' to 'B' on
     page No.5 of the Will and signatures at point 'C' on the back side of the
     Will. In cross examination he deposed that Ram Lal Puri had family terms
     with his father for the last of 30-25 years. He (witness) was not having any
     relations with Madan Lal Puri. Neither he nor his father had family
     relation with plaintiff. He denied the suggestion that his father signed the
     Will on the asking of Madan Lal Puri. He admitted that neither he was
     present when his father signed the Will nor did his father tell him about the
     execution of Will. He did not have personal knowledge about the Will and
     the circumstances prevailing at the time of preparation or execution of the
     Will. He denied the suggestion that his father did not sign the Will. Thus,
     it can be seen that plaintiff after admitting signature of Jagdish Lal on the
     Will i.e. his father signed on the asking of Madan Lal Puri or that he was
     not present when his father signed the Will, gave suggestion that it did not
     bear his signature. Son is the better person to tell whether the signature is
     that of his father or not and not the plaintiff that did not bear the signatures
     of Jagdish Lal Jain.
     56. DW1 in his examination in chief Ex DW1/A and Ex DW1/B deposed
     that he was the eye witness to the execution of the Will which was drafted
     by S. C. Nigam Advocate and was registered on 26.09.1977. Ram Lal Puri
     also put the Will in his own voice over tape recorder on 22.09.1979 which
     he had witnessed. The tape recorded cassette is Ex DW1/3. He also
     deposed that registration of the Will was not done in his presence but he
     was not attesting witness to it. He further deposed that Ram Lal Puri also
     wrote in Urdu on 22.09.1979 about the execution of Will. Said Urdu
     writing in the hand of Shri Ram Lal Puri is Ex DW1/4. In cross
     examination he deposed that Ram Lal Puri was his brother-in-law
     (Saddhu) i.e. his wife and that of Ram Lal Puri were sisters. He met Ram
     Lal Puri at the residence of Mr. Nigam Advocate who had prepared the
     Will at Bhogal an reaching he Bhogal he met Kishori Lal Chawla and
     Jagdish Lal Puri. He was not asked to sign the Will as two witness had
     already signed the Will. He admitted that Will was typed and signed in the
     office of Advocate at Bohgal. Plaintiff's this question amounted to
     admission on the part of the plaintiff that Will was typed and signed in the
     office of the advocate at Bhogal. He was not given suggestion that Ram
RFA No. 985/2018                                                     Page 12 of 17

      Lal Puri did not execute the Will nor that he (witness) was not present at
      the office of the advocate nor that that will was not registered in his
      presence or that Ran Lal Puri did not write about the execution of Will in
      Urdu or recording the same over tape recorder in cassette.
      57. On the day when the Will Ex DW1/D1 was tendered in evidence it was
      more than 30 years old. In fact when the same was filed on the court
      record it has already completed 30 years of its execution and was placed
      from safe custody. Therefore, there is presumption in favour of its
      execution in view of Section 90 of Indian Evidence Act. Thus only by way
      presumption but also by way of requirement of Section 69 of the Indian
      Evidence Act, defendant has been able to proved the registered Will
      14.09.1977 Ex DW3/3 (also exhibited as Ex DW1/D1). The effect of the
      Will shall be considered while deciding the issue No.9.”

6.    I completely agree with the aforesaid reasoning, discussion and
conclusion of the trial court and nothing could be argued on behalf of
the appellants to dislodge the factum of proving of the Registered Will
of the father, Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri, dated 14.09.1977 which was
proved through the witnesses DW-1/Sh. Mohinder Nath Uppal and the
Advocate Sh. S.C. Nigam, who deposed as DW-5, and he in his
professional capacity as an Advocate had drafted the Will and
witnessed its execution and attestation. The challenge by the
appellants to the decision of Issue no. 4 in favour of the defendant no.
1/ Late Sh. Madan Lal Puri is, therefore, rejected.
7.    The only other issue which is to be examined is as to whether
the suit properties were HUF properties. In this regard, I may note
RFA No. 985/2018                                                 Page 13 of 17

that in the plaint except mentioning that the first two properties
situated at Sadar Bazar were purchased from ancestral properties, no
further averment was made as to how the HUF came into existence.
There is no averment in the plaint that the father, Late Sh. Ram Lal
Puri, inherited any property from his paternal ancestors prior to 1956
when the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 came into force. Once this is
the position, even if Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri inherited any properties
from his paternal ancestors, and which would be after 1956,
inheritance by Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri of such properties from his
father or paternal ancestors was as self-acquired properties and not as
HUF properties in view of the judgments of the Supreme Court in the
cases of Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Kanpur and Others v.
Chander Sen and Others, (1986) 3 SCC 567 and Yudhishter v. Ashok
Kumar, (1987) 1 SCC 204. In fact this court would also like to note
that averments with respect to the ancestral properties allegedly
coming to the hands of the father late Sh. Ram Lal Puri is a
completely vague averment as the query of what were the ancestral
properties remains unanswered i.e. their specific details have not been
mentioned in the plaint nor stated in the deposition of any of the
RFA No. 985/2018                                          Page 14 of 17

witnesses of the plaintiff. The trial court has also further reasoned that
both PW-1/Amita @ Smt. Ritu Gandhi/daughter of the deceased
plaintiff and defendant no. 2/Smt. Manorama/sister of the deceased
plaintiff who supported the plaintiff, could not prove that the suit
properties were not the self-acquired properties of Late Sh. Ram Lal
Puri.   In fact, PW-1 conceded in her cross-examination that the
property at Jaidev Park, Rohtak Road, Punjabi Bagh Delhi was
purchased by Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri through a Sale Deed in his own
name and his two brothers and subsequently Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri
purchased the share of his two brothers by a registered Sale Deed.
PW-1 also admitted that Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri had mortgaged the
plot with the Government and raised a loan to construct the property.
PW-1/ Amita @ Smt. Ritu Gandhi further admitted that the loan was
repaid by Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri and therefore a Conveyance Deed
dated 13.06.1985 /Ex. DW-3/14 was executed by the government in
favour of Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri.
8.           Accordingly, the trial court has held and rightly so, that
the suit properties were not HUF properties and were the self-acquired
properties of the father Late Sh. Ram Lal Puri by observing as under:
RFA No. 985/2018                                            Page 15 of 17

     “66. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Commissioner of Wealth Tax v. Chander
     Sen; 1986 AIR 1753 and in Uttam v. Saubahg Singh & Ors bearing Civil
     Appeal No. 2360/2016 arising out of SLP No. 6036/2014 decided on
     02.03.2016 has held that when a Hindu male inherits property from his
     ancestors he inherits the same as his personal property vis-a-vis his own
     sons. Thus, the properties in the hands of Ram Lal Puri was his personal
     properties even if he received the same from his own father or fore father.
     67. In any case plaintiff himself in his earlier suit Ex DW3/8 has
     admitted/pleaded that both properties was his father's exclusive/absolute
     properties. In the present case also PW1 the sole witness of the plaintiff in
     her cross examination admitted that property No. 3/9 Jaidev Park was
     purchased as a plot vide registered Sale Deed by Sh. Ram Lal Puri and his
     two brothers and subsequently Ram Lal Puri had purchased the share of
     his two brothers in this property by registered Sale Deed. She further
     admitted that Ram Lal Puri had mortgaged the plot with the government
     and raised loan to build this property. She further admitted that said loan
     was repaid by Sh. Ram Lal Puri and Re-Conveyance Deed dt 13.06.1985
     Ex DW3/14 was executed between the Government and Sh. Ram Lal Puri.
     Neither plaintiff nor his witness PW1 ever disclosed which property Ram
     Lal Puri had inherited from his predecessor or how much compensation or
     money Ram Lal Puri had received from his predecessor. Thus, plaintiff
     even otherwise also has not been able to prove that any share or money or
     any property Ram Lal Puri had inherited from his own ancestors.
     68. Testimony of the defendant No.2 who is supporting the case of the
     plaintiff is also of no help to the plaintiff as she in the cross examination
     deposed that her father had told her that both properties were purchased by
     his father form ancestral funds but she admitted that she had not pleaded
     that her father had told him so. She was unable to tell as to from which
     property or from the funds generated from which business the suit
     properties were purchased. She did not remember which type of business
     was carried out by her father or how much income was derived from the
     said business. She further deposed that she could not identify the signature
     of her father if shown to her and she did not know if her father had
     executed registered Will during his lifetime. She could not say if any funds
     was given by her grandfather to her father for purchase of the property.
     Even defendant No.2 was not able to prove that properties in the hand of
     Ram Lal Puri was not his personal properties.
RFA No. 985/2018                                                   Page 16 of 17

       69. Thus, the properties in the hand of Ram Lal Puri was his personal
       properties in respect of which he made testamentary disposition in favour
       of defendant No.1 by way of registered Will dt 14.09.1977 Ex DW3/3
       (also exhibited Ex DW1/D1) and therefore neither deceased plaintiff nor
       defendant No.2 is entitled to any share in the properties, business left
       behind by late Shri Ram Lal Puri. Hence, issue No.9 is decided against the
       plaintiff and in favour of defendants.”
9.             In view of the aforesaid discussion, I do not find any
merit in this appeal and the same is hereby dismissed.
