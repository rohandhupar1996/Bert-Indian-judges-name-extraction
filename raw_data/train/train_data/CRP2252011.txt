                      Civil Revision Petition No. 225 of 2011
                                             BEFORE
                  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Sujit Kumar Ghosh, learned counsel for the petitioner. None
    appeared for the respondents though notice was duly served upon them.
    2.       This revision petition is against the order dated 06.06.2011 passed by the
    Munsiff No.1, Dhubri in Misc. (J) Case No. 2/2011 in Title Execution Case No.
    24/2005 dismissing the application bearing petition No. 64 of the judgment debtor/
    the petitioner under Section 47 C.P.C.
    3.       The brief facts of the case is that the predecessor-in-interest of the
    respondents as plaintiff filed a suit being Title Suit No. 116/1985 before the Court
    of learned Munsiff, Dhubri against the predecessor of the petitioner as defendant,
    praying for a decree of delivery of khas possession of the land involved in the suit,
    declaring right and title of the said land evicting the defendant therefrom and
    decree for delivery of khas possession on the land involved in the case by
    demolishing the houses and evicting the defendants therefrom including a decree
    for cost of the suit in which the predecessor of the petitioner filed his written
    statement.
    4.       After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the learned Munsiff No.1,
    Dhubri by his order dated 14.05.1987 dismissed the suit of the predecessor of the
    respondents. Against the same, the predecessor of the respondents during his life
    time preferred an appeal being Title Appeal No. 38/1987 before the Civil Judge,
    Senior Division, Dhubri. The said appellate Court by judgment and order dated
    10.02.1999 dismissed the said Title Appeal No. 38/1987 of the respondents,
    upholding and affirming the judgment and decree dated 14.05.1987 passed by the
    trial Court, i.e. the Court of learned Munsiff No. 1, Dhubri in Title Suit No.
    116/1985.      In the mean while the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents/
    appellant/plaintiff Hira Lal Goria expired during the said appeal and the respondents
    substituted themselves in place of said appellant.
    C. R. P. No. 225 of 2011                                                    Page 1 of 5

5.       Against the same, the respondents preferred Second Appeal being RSA No.
102/1999 before this Court. After hearing the parties, this Court by the judgment
and order dated 16.08.2014 came to the finding that the revenue paying receipts
for the suit land on which the reliance had been placed by the defendant of the suit
ex-facie indicates that revenue was paid for the year 1979-80, 1981-82 by the
respondent defendant on behalf of the appellants/plaintiffs which is sufficient to
establish that till that point of time the respondent/defendant had acknowledged
the appellant’s/plaintiff’s title in the suit land and where the suit being filed in the
year 1985, it is beyond once comprehension as to how the same could be
dismissed on the ground of being barred by limitation and accordingly hold that the
learned Courts below have misdirected themselves on the fundamental principles of
law relating to adverse possession and, accordingly, allowed the said second appeal
being RSA No.120 of 1999 of the respondents on merit and set aside the
impugned judgment and decree.
6.       On 29.11.2004, a decree in the said RSA No. 120/1999 was prepared
holding that the impugned judgment and decree dated 10.02.1999 passed by the
learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dhubri in Title Appeal No. 38/1987 was set
aside.    Thereafter,    the    decree-holders/respondents    initiated  an   execution
proceeding being Title Execution No. 24/2005 in Title Suit No. 116/1985 before the
learned Civil Judge, Junior Division, Dhubri on the basis of said decree dated
29.11.2004 passed in RSA No. 120/1999 and on the basis of judgment and order
dated 16.08.2004 claimed for right and recovery of khas possession of the suit land
and for declaring the title of the plaintiff over the scheduled land and also for
evicting the defendant/petitioners herein from the suit land by demolishing the
house of the defendants from the suit land in order to give khas possession of the
suit land to the plaintiffs/respondents herein.
7.       However, the judgment debtor, predecessor-in-interest of the defendants/
petitioners herein on 28.03.2011 filed an application under Section 47 of the C.P.C.
stating that in the judgment and order dated 16.08.2004 passed in RSA No. 120 of
1999, did not discuss with regard to right, title, interest of the parties and
entitlement of recovery of possession over the suit land and the said judgment
C. R. P. No. 225 of 2011                                                    Page 2 of 5

does not have any operative part and on the basis of the same an effective and
executable decree cannot be drawn and that the decree dated 13.09.2005
produced by the decree holders/respondents herein had been drawn by the Court
of learned Civil Judge, Junior Division, Dhubri for execution drawn on the basis of
the judgment and order dated 16.08.2004 passed in RSA No.120 of 1999, which is
wholly without any jurisdiction and not tenable in law and, that the decree holder
ought to have produced the decree dated 29.11.2004 drawn by the Hon’ble High
Court and that the decree dated 14.09.2005 drawn by the Civil Judge, Junior
Division No. 1, Dhubri, (Munsiff No.1, Dhubri) being not at all executable as it was
not drawn by the High Court, and being not in consonance with the said judgment
dated 16.08.2004 passed by this High Court in RSA No.120 of 1999, the said Title
Execution Case No. 24/2005 should be dismissed.
8.       However, the learned Executing Court came to a finding that this Court by it
judgment and order dated 16.08.2004 passed in RSA No. 120 of 1999 set aside the
judgment and decree dated 10.02.1999 passed in Title Appeal No. 38/1987 (passed
by learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dhubri) which goes to show that the
judgment and decree passed in said Title Suit No. 116/1985 too got set aside,
which was affirmed by the First Appellate Court and that when the High Court
directed to prepare the decree in terms of its judgment dated 16.08.2004 passed in
RSA No. 120/1999, then the original court i.e. the then Civil Judge, Junior Division
No. 1, Dhubri rightly prepared the decree dated 13.09.2005 in terms of the said
judgment and order dated 16.08.2009 passed in RSA No.120 of 1999 by the High
Court, which attained finality and the execution proceeding was rightly initiated by
the then learned Civil Judge, Junior Division No. 1, Dhubri which is in terms of RSA
No. 120 of 1999 as the High Court in the said RSA have clearly held that the suit
should not have been dismissed on being barred by limitation. The learned Munsiff
No. 1, Dhubri, by the impugned order dated 06.06.2011 also came to a finding that
the judgment debtor have preferred the said petition under Section 47 of the C.P.C.
to scuttle the decree holder from enjoying the fruits of the decree and in addition
to that the said petition under Section 47 of C.P.C. of the judgment debtor/
petitioners is hit by Section 137 of the Limitation Act and for the said reason,
C. R. P. No. 225 of 2011                                                   Page 3 of 5

finding no merit, the learned Munsiff No.1, Dhubri by the impugned order dated
06.06.2011 dismissed the said petition of the judgment debtor/petitioners.
9.       From the perusal of the judgment and order dated 16.08.2004 passed by
this Court earlier in RSA No. 120 of 1999, it is seen that by the said order the
impugned judgment and decree i.e. the judgment and decree dated 10.02.1999
passed by the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dhubri in Title Appeal No. 38 of
1987 affirming the judgment and decree dated 14.08.1987 passed by the learned
Munsiff No. 1, Dhubri, in Title Suit No. 116 of 1985 was set aside and directed to
prepare the decree in terms of the same. Accordingly, on 29.11.2004, this Court
prepared the decree in said RSA No. 120 of 1999 decreeing that judgment and
decree dated 10.02.1999 passed by the leaned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dhubri
in Title Appeal No. 38 of 1987 was set aside. But, the learned civil Judge, Junior
Division No. 1, Dhubri on 13.09.2005 in Title Execution Case No. 24 of 2005
prepared a separate decree as noted above which was subsequently upheld by the
learned Munsiff No. 1, Dhubri, by the impugned order dated 06.06.2005. It is worth
mentioning that this Court by the order dated 16.08.2004 passed in RSA No. 120 of
1999 came to a clear finding that when the defendant paid the revenue for the
years 1979-80, 1981-82 for the suit land on behalf of the plaintiff, and the suit
being filed in the year 1985, the Courts below could not have dismissed the title
suit of the plaintiff “on the ground of limitation” and on the fundamental principles
of law relating to “adverse possession”. From such finding of this Court, by the
judgment and order dated 16.08.2004 passed in RSA No. 120 of 1999, it appears
that the decision of the First Appellate Court as well as the Trial Court have been
set aside and the plaintiffs are found to have been entitled to succeed in the suit.
But, the said judgment dated 16.08.2004 passed in RSA No. 120 of 1999 specified
that the impugned judgment and decree has been set aside i.e. the judgment and
decree dated 10.02.1999 passed by the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dhubri
in Title Appeal No.38/1987 and accordingly asked the Registry to prepare the
decree in terms of the same.
10.      The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Laxm i R am Bhuyan Vs. Hari
Prasad Bhuyan and ors., reported in (2003) 1 SCC 197 , an appeal arising out
C. R. P. No. 225 of 2011                                                  Page 4 of 5

of this Court; have held that – “if there is such an incidental slip or omission in
manifestation of the Court by coughing the relief to which the plaintiffs were
entitled in the event of their succeeding in the suit, Section 152 C.P.C. enables the
Court to vary its judgment so as to give effect to its meaning and intention”.
11.      Considering the above and following the observation laid down by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Laxmi Ram Bhuyan (supra) this Civil Revision
Petition is allowed by setting aside and quash the order dated 06.06.2011 passed
by the learned Munsiff No. 1, Dhubri in Misc. (J) Case No. 2/2011 arising out of the
Title Execution Case No. 24 of 2005 in rejecting the petition under Section 47 of the
C.P.C. preferred by the petitioners in said Title Execution Case No. 24/2005
pending before the learned Munsiff No. 1, Dhubri, as well as the impugned decree
dated 13.05.2005 prepared by the learned Civil Judge, Junior Division, Dhubri,
granting liberty to the respondents/decree holders of RSA No. 120 of 1999 to move
this Court under Section 152 C.P.C. seeking appropriate rectification in the
judgment dated 16.08.2004 passed in said RSA No. 120 of 1999 so as to clearly
specify the extent and manner of relief to which, in the opinion of the High Court,
the successful party entitled consistently with the intention expressed in the said
judgment dated 16.08.2004.
12.      With the aforesaid observation and direction, this civil revision petition
stands allowed.
13.      The interim order passed earlier in this proceeding on 29.07.2011 stands
merged with this order.
14.      Registry shall return the record of Title Execution Case No. 24 of 2005 to
the court of learned Munsiff No. 1, Dhubri, with a copy of this order.
                                                                JUDGE
