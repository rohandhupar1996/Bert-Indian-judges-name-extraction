       CORAM:
       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.     By virtue of this appeal, the Appellant New India Assurance Company
       Limited impugned the judgment dated 16.08.2011 passed by the
       Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the Claims Tribunal) whereby a
       compensation of Rs.4,61,440/- was awarded in favour of Respondents
       no.1 to 3 for the death of deceased Chander Shekhar who died on the
       night of 30.11.2002 while driving Tata Qualis bearing registration
       no.DL-5CB-5034.
2.     The only ground of challenge led by the learned counsel for the
       Appellant at the time of hearing of the appeal is that since the
       Appellant had proved conscious and willful breach of the terms and
MAC. APP. No.1050/2011                                          Page 1 of 4

       conditions of the insurance policy, the Appellant Insurance Company
       was entitled to be exonerated.
3.     The manner of death of deceased Chander Shekhar can be extracted
       from para 6 of the impugned judgment:-
                  “6. PW1 stated in his affidavit Ex. PW1/A, deceased
                  Chander Shekhar was his son who was employed to drive
                  Tata Qualis bearing registration no. DL5CB5034 owned
                  by respondent no. 2. On 30/11/02 at about 7 pm, some
                  passengers including one lady hired the Tata Qualis for
                  journey from Delhi towards Hardoi, UP. When they
                  reached Aligarh, after taking tea and Jalpan, they
                  proceeded for further journey. When at night, they
                  reached in thick forest some kilometers ahead of U.P.,
                  the passengers decided to steel the Tata Qualis for which
                  they had made a planning. The lady passenger got the
                  Tata Qualis stopped on the pretext that she wanted to
                  vomit. The deceased driver stopped the Tata Qualis, he
                  was strangulated by the passengers and they threw his
                  dead body in a river in the jungle. When the Tata Qualis
                  did not return to Delhi within stipulated schedule on
                  30.11.02, respondent no. 1 lodged a written complaint in
                  police station Seelampur. On the basis of the said
                  complaint, FIR NO.424/02 U/s 365 IPC was registered.
                  During investigations, the lady passenger was
                  apprehended and on her disclosure, other accused
                  persons who were also the passengers in Tata Qualis
                  were arrested. They were all charge sheeted for the
                  offences punishable U/s 365/302/201/120B/34 IPC.
                  However, the dead body of the deceased as well as the
                  Tata Qualis could not be recovered.”
4.     Relying on Rita Devi v. New India Assurance Company Ltd., 2000
       AIR (SC) 1930, the Claims Tribunal held that the death of the
       deceased was caused accidently while committing theft of Tata Qualis
MAC. APP. No.1050/2011                                           Page 2 of 4

       bearing registration no.DL-5CB-5034 belonging to the insured. The
       finding of the Claims Tribunal to this extent is not challenged.
5.     As far as the liability of the Insurance Company is concerned, the facts
       leading to the death of Chander Shekhar have already been extracted
       above. It is apparent that on 30.11.2002, some passengers including a
       lady had hired the Qualis for journey from Delhi to U.P.            It is
       therefore, apparent that the taxi was being run for hire and reward.
       The Appellant Insurance Company examined R3W1 Ashok Kumar,
       Assistant, working in the concerned Branch of the Appellant Company
       to prove the terms and conditions of the policy. Carbon copy of the
       policy was proved as Ex.R3W1/A.
6.     The question for consideration is whether the copy of the insurance
       policy produced on record by the Appellant can be looked into to
       prove the terms and conditions of the policy.
7.     Admittedly, no notice was given to the insured, owner of Tata Qualis
       bearing registration no.DL-5CB-5034 for production of the original
       insurance policy.      Copy of the insurance policy being secondary
       evidence cannot be looked into unless the Appellant proves that
       primary evidence is not available. Consequently, I am unable to
       subscrib to the view taken by the Claims Tribunal that though the
MAC. APP. No.1050/2011                                         Page 3 of 4

       Appellant had failed to prove that the Tata Qualis was being used for
       hire or as a commercial vehicle, yet nothing absolved the Insurance
       Company to insure a vehicle even for hire and reward. Since the
       Insurance Policy has not been legally proved, it cannot be said that the
       insured committed breach of the terms and conditions of the policy.
8.     The appeal, therefore, has to fail; the same is accordingly dismissed.
9.     The statutory amount of Rs.25,000/- shall be refunded to the Appellant
       Insurance Company.
10.    Sixty percent of the amount deposited has already been released. Rest
       of the amount shall be released/held in fixed deposit in terms of the
       order passed by the Claims Tribunal.
11.    Pending application also stands disposed of.
                                                        (G.P. MITTAL)
