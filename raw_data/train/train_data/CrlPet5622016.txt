                               Crl. Pet. No. 562 of 2016
                                            BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
13.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Ashim Kumar Chamuah, learned counsel for the petitioner.
             The petitioner as a complainant filed a complaint case on 15.07.2013 before
    the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati being C.R. Case No.
    2286C/2013 against the sole respondent for the offences under Section 138 and
    142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, as amended, read with Section 420 of
    the Indian Penal Code for dishonor of a cheque bearing No. 548477 dated
    21.03.2013 for an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- drawn on ICICI Bank, Fancy Bazar
    Branch, Guwahati issued by the sole respondent. The said amount could not be
    drawn and returned unpaid on account of ‘Cheque Stop’.
             The CJM, Kamrup (M), Guwahati by his order dated 15.07.2013 transferred
    the said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 to the court of learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st
    Class, Kamrup (M), Guwahati for its disposal. The learned JMFC, Kamrup (M),
    Guwahati after considering the initial deposition on affidavit of the complainant, the
    documents annexed with the said complaint and recording the initial deposition of
    the petitioner being prima facie satisfied, took cognizance of the offences under
    Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the respondent by his order
    dated 17.07.2013 and directed the said complainant/petitioner to take steps for
    issuance of summons to the sole accused/respondent herein. As the accused/sole
    respondent did not appear in the matter on the dates fixed for his appearance in
    the said proceeding, the learned Trial Magistrate directed the petitioner to take
    steps for issuance of fresh summons to the said accused, which was accordingly
    complied by the petitioner.
             By an order dated 16.05.2015, the learned Trial Magistrate found from the
    postal receipt submitted by the complainant/petitioner that summons on the
    accused person of the case was issued on 02.03.2015 and following the provisions
    of Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, the learned Trial Magistrate presumed
    Crl. Ptn. No. 562 of 2016                                                 Page 1 of 5

that the summons have been duly served upon the concerned accused person and,
as such, issued an order of Non-Bailable Warrant of Arrest against the said accused
i.e. the sole respondent herein.
         However, the accused did not appear in the case on the date fixed. As such,
by order dated 28.08.2015, the learned JMFC, Kamrup (M), Guwahati directed the
petitioner/complainant to take steps on the official address of the accused person
fixing 03.11.2015 for appearance of the accused person. On 03.11.2015, the
complainant remained absent in the matter with steps which was accordingly
allowed by the Court. With regard to service of notice on the accused person, on
03.011.2015 it was observed by the Trial Magistrate that the accused is not
traceable in the address that was furnished by the complainant and accordingly,
directed the complainant/petitioner to take fresh steps on the accused of the case
as soon as possible fixing 30.12.2015 for appearance of the accused person.
         On 30.12.2015, the complainant again remained absent with steps which
was allowed and since the accused remained absent, the learned Trial Magistrate
issued fresh NBWA against him fixing 11.03.2016 for his appearance. Again on
11.03.2016, the complainant remained absent with steps which was allowed and
since the accused did not appear in the matter, the learned Magistrate ordered
issuance of fresh NBWA against the accused fixing 26.05.2016 for his appearance.
On 26.05.2016, both the complainant and the accused remained absent and the
Trial Magistrate fixed the matter on 14.06.2016 for necessary order. On
14.06.2016, both the complainant and the accused remained absent in said
complaint case as well as the concerned Trial Magistrate was also on leave and said
matter was fixed on 22.06.2016 for necessary order.
         On 22.06.2016, the complainant remained absent without any steps and the
learned Trial Magistrate on perusal of the case record, found that since 26.05.2016
the complainant did not appear in the matter consecutively on three fixed dates
and considering the same, the Trial Magistrate came to an opinion that the
complainant might have lost interest to pursue the case and as such, dismissed the
said complaint Case No. 2286C/2013 preferred by the complainant i.e. the present
petitioner against the accused (the sole respondent herein) and recalled the order
Crl. Ptn. No. 562 of 2016                                               Page 2 of 5

of NBWA issued against the said accused person, acquitted him and also set him at
liberty forthwith.
         Being aggrieved with the said order dated 22.06.2016 of the learned JMFC,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati, the petitioner has preferred this petition for setting aside
the said order passed by the learned JMFC, Kamrup (M), Guwahati in C.R. Case No.
2286C/2013.
         The petitioner contended that his engaged counsel Sri Palash Pratim
Borthakur, who was conducting his said complaint case, suffered from jaundice and
was diagnosed of the medical ailment as ‘moderate hepatic fibrosis’, due to which
he left for his native at Jorhat and did not appear in his said case on the dates fixed
and did not communicate the petitioner the date of the case as to when it was
fixed by the learned Trial Magistrate. It is also submitted by the petitioner that the
other counsel on record Smt. Ivy Rajkhowa was no longer associated with the said
complaint case of the petitioner and as the main conducting counsel of his case Sri
Palash Pratim Borthakur due to his said medical ailment could not appear in said
C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 before the Trial Magistrate, he failed take necessary
steps on behalf of the petitioner/complainant on 26.05.2016, 14.06.2016 and
22.06.2016, the learned Trial Magistrate wrongly dismissed petitioner’s said
complaint case for non-prosecution. In this regard, the petitioner has also annexed
the medical reports and the prescription of the counsel for the petitioner Palash
Pratim Borthakur.
         Considered the submissions of Mr. Chamuah, learned counsel for the
petitioner.
         In the present case, it is seen that the complainant/petitioner has field his
complaint within time and the learned Magistrate after perusing his affidavit in
evidence and recording his statement being prima facie satisfied, took cognizance
of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and issued
summons to the accused person. Though notice on the accused person was
presumed to be served under the General Clauses Act, the said accused never
appeared in the matter and during his such non-appearance, the impugned order
dated 22.06.2016 was passed in the said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013.
Crl. Ptn. No. 562 of 2016                                                  Page 3 of 5

         From the certified copy of the order sheets of the case annexed to the
petition, it is seen that except 26.05.2016, 14.06.2016 and 22.06.2016, whenever
the complainant/petitioner occasionally remained absent in said C.R. Case No.
2286C/2013, he remained absent with proper steps by filing necessary applications,
which were accordingly allowed by the learned Trial Magistrate. The medical
certificate, prescription and the medical report of the counsel conducting the case
for the petitioner reflects that he was suffering from the medical ailment of ‘hepatic
fibrosis’ and ‘jaundice’ during the period May and June, 2016 and for said reason he
could not appear before the Trial Magistrate on those three dates, i.e. 26.05.2016,
14.06.2016 and 22.06.2016 for which the petitioner/complainant remained
unrepresented before the Trial Magistrate in said C.R. Case.
         It is a settled law that litigant should not suffer for any commission or
omission on the part of the counsel. The Hon’bel Supreme Court in the case of
Rafiq & Another -Vs- Munshilal & Another, reported in (1981) 2 SCC 788 have held
that –
         “ex-parte order of dismissal of appeal passed by the High Court on non
         appearance of appellant’s counsel and rejection of application for restoration
         of such dismissed appeal is not justified as the party should not suffer for the
         inaction, deliberate omission or misdemeanor of his agent, the lawyer as it is
         the litigant who would suffer and whose interest would be jeopardized.”
         It is seen that in the present case also the counsel of the petitioner for his
health ground could not appear in said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 on the three
dates fixed consecutively and out of that on 14.06.2016, the concerned Trial
Magistrate was also on leave.
         Considering the entire aspect of the matter and for the reasons above, in
exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C and for the ends of justice, the
impugned order dated 22.06.2016 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st
Class, Kamrup (M), Guwahati in said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 preferred by the
petitioner/complainant against the accused/sole respondent is hereby set aside and
quashed restoring the said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 to the file of learned JMFC,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati.
Crl. Ptn. No. 562 of 2016                                                   Page 4 of 5

         Further, the petitioner is directed to appear before the learned Judicial
Magistrate, 1st Class, Kamrup(M), Guwahati in said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 11th
August, 2017 and shall produce the certified copy of this order. Further, on such
appearance of the complainant/petitioner, the learned Trial Magistrate, i.e. JMFC,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati shall pass an appropriate order for issuance of fresh
summons to the accused of said C.R. Case directing the petitioner to take fresh
steps on the correct and appropriate address of the accused. Moreover, on proper
application of the complainant/petitioner, the learned Trial Magistrate may consider
to direct him to take steps on the accused of the case by substituted manner,
publishing notice in two widely circulated local newspapers and, thereafter, to
proceed with the said C.R. Case No. 2286C/2013 in accordance with law.
         With the aforesaid observation and direction, this criminal petition stands
disposed of.
                                                                   JUDGE
