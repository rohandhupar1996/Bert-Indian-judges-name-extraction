1.      On the previous two dates of hearing, there was no appearance
on the petitioner’s behalf. Even today, there is no appearance on
behalf of the petitioner. However, adjournment slips had been
circulated.
2.      The petitioner’s grievance is that he was not considered and
promoted to the post of Executive Engineer and that his junior in the
cadre of Assistant Executive Engineer was granted such benefit
overlooking him unjustly.
3.      The facts, in brief, are that the petitioner joined the General
Reserve Engineer Force (GREF)—wing of the Border Roads
Organization after due selection by the Union Public Service
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                                  Page 1

Commission and reported for duties on 24.06.2002 in the grade of
Assistant Executive Engineer. The promotion from that post is to the
cadre of Executive Engineer. Being a Group ‘A’ selection post, a
bench mark of five “Goods” is prescribed for promotion by the
Circulars/Office Memoranda of the Department of Personnel and
Training (DoPT) dated 10.04.1989 and 08.02.2002.
4.      The petitioner was apparently overlooked and his junior Shri
Lakshmikant Wankhede was promoted pursuant to the DPC which
met for this purpose on 12.06.2011. At the relevant time, apparently,
the petitioner was apprised of the fact that for part of the period under
consideration, i.e., 01.04.2005 to 30.09.2005, his performance had
deteriorated to certain extent inasmuch as the final ACR grading was
recorded as “Average”. The petitioner represented against his ACR
gradings and that representation was rejected on 28.02.2011. Against
this, the petitioner approached the Uttarakhand High Court by filing
Writ Petition No. 305/2011. That High Court disposed of the writ
petition on 20.10.2011 requiring the respondents to decide the
petitioner’s representation by a reasoned speaking order within three
months from the date of production of the certified copy.
5.      Pursuant to the directions of the Uttarakhand High Court, the
respondents       considered the   petitioner’s   representation    dated
09.08.2011. The petitioner—in his said representation—had taken
exception to the fact that he was rated as ‘Average’ with five points
by the Accepting Officer even though the initiating and reviewing
officer had concurred with each other and rated his performance as
“Good” granting seven points. In this, the petitioner had relied upon
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                                 Page 2

certain extracts from Swamy’s Manual on Establishment and
Administration particularly the DG, P&T letter dated 21.01.1983. It
was contended that this letter envisioned only one review i.e. by the
reviewing officer and the concept of review by superior or higher
officer did not exist. The respondent GREF considered the petitioner’s
representations and noted—by its impugned order dated 30.12.2011
that his request for upgradation had been rejected on 28.02.2011. It
also took note of the fact that in accordance with the extant DPC
guidelines, particularly the one dated 08.02.2002, a candidate/officer
had to fulfil the prescribed bench mark to be considered for promotion
to those positions/posts based upon the selection criteria. The
respondents also dealt with the contention based upon the letter dated
21.01.1983.
6.      The petitioner argues in these proceedings that the rejection of
his representation in the entire circumstances of the case was not
justified. It is conceded in the writ petition that in a later meeting of
the DPC, the petitioner was promoted with effect from 01.02.2013. It
is stated that the main argument is that the respondents are not bound
by the DoPT memoranda alone, but rather by UPSC guidelines,
especially a part thereof to the extent that if four years’ ACRs fulfil
the bench mark, then the individual concerned can and should be
promoted. It is stressed here that the petitioner had “Good” grading
for the four and a half years and if the clarification/letter of
21.01.1983 were to be given effect to, the appraisal of the Accepting
Officer should be ignored. The petition also urges that the subsequent
Office Memoranda dated 08.09.1998 and 16.06.2000 issued by the
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                                Page 3

DoPT have not been considered and if they are, he would be eligible
for promotion on the date when his junior was promoted.
7.      The respondents in their counter-affidavit rely upon the
speaking order. It is contended that in terms of the existing rules, the
final authority to appraise the performance of an officer is the
Accepting Officer who is superior to the initiating and reviewing
officer. In view of these arrangements, the contention based upon the
office memoranda and letter dated 21.01.1983 is meritless.
8.      It is also urged that given the fact that the petitioner’s request
for upgradation was rejected in February, 2011, the fact remained that
on the record, he did not possess five “Good” ACRs gradings as on
the date the DPC met. i.e, 12.06.2011. Since he did not meet the
eligibility criteria, his name was not considered. The respondents also
urged that the UPSC guidelines cannot be considered binding and rely
upon a decision of this Court in Avinash Tripathi vs. Union of India
and Ors. W.P.(C) No.12596/2009 and connected cases, decided on
06.07.2015.
9.      The above factual discussion would reveal that what is at issue
before this Court is the petitioner’s claim that he was wrongly
overlooked for consideration for promotion to the post of Executive
Engineer when the DPC met for that purpose on 12.06.2011. It is not
disputed that the bench mark prescribed for promotion to the said post
of Executive Engineer is five “Good” ACR gradings for five years
preceding the year of consideration. The petitioner unfortunately was
graded as “Average” for about five months between 01.04.2005 to
30.09.2005. Even though the Initiating and the Accepting Officer
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                                 Page 4

appear to have graded him as “Good”, i.e., within the bench mark, but
the Accepting Officer—the ultimate authority—graded him as
“Average” and with five marks, i.e., below the bench mark.
10.     The first question is whether this kind of grading can be called
a illegal or contrary to the guidelines. In support of the submission
that it is unjustified, the petitioner relies upon a letter dated
21.01.1983. Apart from the fact that the said letter has not been
annexed to the petition, even from the substance relied upon, it
appears that qualification in that instance depended upon the rules or
guidelines which envisioned the recording of ACR as a two tier
process, i.e., Accepting Officer and the Reviewing Officer. However,
wherever rules or guidelines exist which specifically require that
appraisals by the Initiating and Reviewing Officer need to be further
accpted, they cannot be ignored in any manner, i.e., as is sought to be
urged by the petitioner. In the present case, the petition has not
challenged the existence of the guidelines which mandate final
acceptance by the officer highest in hierarchy who has occasion to
consider the performance and discharge of duties by every officer. In
the circumstances, the argument of the petitioner that the appraisal by
the Accepting Officer should be ignored is not sound. The said
contention is consequently rejected.
11.     The second argument that the petitioner’s claim also turns upon
the fact that UPSC in its guidelines (in a document termed as
“Important Instructions/Guidelines on DPC’s (Promotions)—Internal
Guidelines of UPSC regarding Treatment of Penalties by the DPC”)
has somewhere indicated that wherever the bench mark is “Good”, it
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                               Page 5

would be sufficient if an individual candidate is deemed to have
fulfilled the four bench mark grading or requirement if he/she
possesses four “Good” gradings rather than five. In answer to this
submission, the respondents rely upon guidelines of the DoPT issued
on 08.02.2002 to say that such circulars would prevail since DoPT is a
nodal agency for determining the criteria and not UPSC which plays
an advisory role.
12.     The petitioner primarily places reliance upon the following
extract of the UPSC guidelines:-
         “As per the DoPT OM No.35034/7/97-Estt.(D) dated
         08th February, 2002, the mode of promotion is
         ‘selection’. The element of selectivity shall be
         determined with reference to the relevant Bench Mark
         (‘Very Good’ or ‘Good’) prescribed for promotion. It
         is further provided that the DPC shall determine the
         merit of those being assessed for promotion with
         reference to the prescribed Bench Mark and
         accordingly grade the officers as ‘Fit’ or ‘Unfit’ only.
         Only those who are graded ‘Fit’(i.e. who meet the
         prescribed Bench Mark) by the DPC shall be included
         and arranged in the select panel in order of their inter
         se seniority in the feeder grade. Those officers who are
         graded ‘Unfit’ (in terms of the prescribed Bench Mark)
         by the DPC shall not be included in the select panel.
         Thus, there shall be no suppression in promotion
         among those who are graded ‘Fit’ (in terms of the
         prescribed Bench Mark) by the DPC.
         The Commission, in exercise of their constitutional
         functions as envisaged in Article 320 of the
         Constitution took a conscious decision that an officer
         attaining at least four bench mark gradings out of 5
         ACRs, as prescribed by the Govt. of India in
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                              Page 6

         Department of Personnel and Training OM
         No.22011/9/98-Estt. (D) dated 8.9.1998, read with
         subsequent OM of even number dated 16.06.2000,
         should be assessed as fit for promotion and this
         decision is applicable to all DPCs pertaining to the
         vacancy year 2003-04 and subsequent years.
         DoP&T, vide their OM No. 22011/3/200-Estt(D) dated
         18.02.2008, have been issued instructions regarding
         benchmark for promotion at the level of JS and above
         from the panel year 2008-09. In their OM it has been
         mentioned that the DPC may ensure that for the
         promotion to the scale of Rs.18,400-22,400 and above,
         the prescribed benchmark of ‘Very Good’ is invariably
         met in all ACRs of five years under consideration.”
13.     In Avinash Tripathi (supra), the petitioner had identically
urged that UPSC instructions would prevail over that of the Central
Government. The Court rejected the submission and held as follows:-
         “16. As far as the petitioners’ reliance on the
         instructions of the UPSC is concerned, it is relevant to
         extract the same - which has been produced in the
         course of the proceedings as follows: -
         “The Commission, in exercise of their constitutional
         functions as envisaged in Article 320 of the
         Constitution took a conscious decision that an officer
         attaining at least four bench mark gradings out of 5
         ACRs, as prescribed by the Govt. of India in
         Department of Personnel and Training OM
         No.22011/9/98-Estt.(D) dated 8.9.1998, read with
         subsequent OM of even number dated 16.6.2000,
         should be assessed as fit for promotion and this
         decision applicable to all DPCs pertaining to the
         vacancy year 2003-04 and subsequent years.”
W.P.(C) No.2358/2013                                              Page 7

         The above extract, upon which the petitioners have
         placed reliance, is contained in a document styled as
         “Appointment Branch, Appointment by Promotion”.
         These documents refer to the DoPT’s Circulars
         including the Circulars dated 10.04.1989 and
         08.02.2002. It also records that for promotion to the
         lowest of Group “A” post, benchmark would be
         “Good”. In these circumstances, the deviation, if one
         may say so, expressed by the Commission in the extract
         relied upon cannot be the sole determinative
         consideration to hold that for promotion to the post of
         Executive Engineer in the Border Roads Development
         Board, an individual is deemed to be eligible if she/he
         possesses at least four “Good” gradings in the
         preceding five years.
14.     For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that there is no
merit in the petitioner’s claim that he was wrongly overlooked for
promotion to Executive Engineer when the DPC met on 12.06.2011.
        The writ petition is dismissed in the above terms.
