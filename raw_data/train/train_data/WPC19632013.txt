                               WP(C) No. 1963 of 2013
                                          BEFORE
                  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
10.07.2017
            Heard Mr. Ajit Kumar Dutta, learned counsel for the petitioner. Also heard
    Mr. Abani Deka, learned Standing Counsel, Secondary Education Department, for
    respondent Nos.1 to 3 and Mr. Abdur Rahman Sikdar, learned counsel for the
    respondent No.5. Respondent No.4 did not enter appearance in the matter in
    spite of receipt of notice and the court by its earlier order dated 16.12.2014
    considered that service of notice on all the respondents are complete.
            During the venture stage itself, the Managing Committee of Begum Abida
    Ahmed Girls Higher Secondary School, Ganirgram, in the district of Cachar on
    05.03.1991 appointed the petitioner Md. Nurul Haque Barbhuiya, M.Sc.
    (Mathematics) as an Assistant Teacher of said school, pursuant to which he joined
    his service in that school. Later in pursuance to the Government Order dated
    16.11.1991, the Director of Secondary Education, Assam by his order dated
    21.03.1992, provincialised the services of teaching and non-teaching staff of said
    Begum Abida Ahmed Girls Higher Secondary School, Ganirgram including the
    service of the petitioner w.e.f. 19.11.1991 under the Assam Secondary Education
    (Provincialisation) Act, 1977. Subsequently by an order dated 30.12.1994, the
    Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar transferred the petitioner from said Begum
    Abida Ahmed Girls HS School to Judhisthir Saha HS School, Beharabazar, district
    Cachar vice one Durgadas Chakraborty, an Assistant Teacher of J Saha HS School
    was transferred to Siddheswar HS School, Katigorah, Cachar. Accordingly, the
    petitioner appeared before the Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar on
    03.01.1995 and submitted his joining report and then joined said J Saha HS
    School on 05.01.1995. The service of the petitioner as Assistant Teacher B.Sc. in
    said J Saha HS School was confirmed in the graduate cadre in his service against
    the post permanently retained w.e.f. 01.03.1996. The respondent No.6, Assistant
    Teacher of said J Saha HS School preferred a writ petition being WP(C)
    No.3140/2011 who joined said J Saha HS School on 29.05.1992 in graduate scale
    prior to the petitioner claiming seniority over the petitioner in that school stating
     WP(C) No. 1963 of 2013                                                   Page 1 of 4

that the petitioner was appointed under a Scheme only, namely the ‘Minimum
Need Programme’ and was brought to the regular establishment/institution by an
order dated 23.09.1999 giving effect from 01.03.1996 and that the petitioner
joined the said school only on 05.03.1995 after his transfer on 30.12.1994 which
was without any TA and DA and that such transfer of the petitioner was at his
interest.
        This Court by order dated 31.01.12 passed in WP(C) No. 3140/2011
determined seniority of the respondent No.5 above the petitioner and set aside
and quashed the order dated 10.02.2011 passed by Inspector of Schools, Cachar,
Silchar by which the petitioner was declared senior to the respondent No. 5, with
the observation that necessary consequences would follow. The petitioner as an
appellant preferred WA No.47/2012 against the said order dated 31.01.2012
passed in WP(C) 3140/12 and the Hon’ble Division Bench of this Court after
hearing the parties by its order dated 16.11.2012 set aside and quashed the order
dated 31.01.2012 passed by learned Single Judge in said WP(C) No. 3140/2011
and directed the Secretary to the Government of Assam in the Secondary
Education Department to determine the seniority between the petitioner and the
respondent No.5 after giving them opportunity of hearing. While the issue
regarding the seniority between the petitioner and the respondent No.5 was
pending before the concerned Commissioner & Secretary, Secondary Education
Department, the Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar by an order dated
22.03.2013 entrusted the respondent No.5 to be the in-Charge Principal of said J
Saha HS School w.e.f. 22.03.2013, without entrusting him with the financial
power.
        Being aggrieved with the said order of the Inspector of Schools, Cachar,
Silchar dated 22.03.2013, the petitioner has preferred this writ petition stating
that this Court after due consideration of the matter allowed the Inspector of
Schools, Cachar, Silchar to be the in-Charge Principal of the said school till the
determination of inter-se seniority between the petitioner and the respondent
No.5. The petitioner contended that the Hon’ble Division Bench of this Court in
WA No.47/2012 on 16.11.2012 considering the decision of the Full Bench of this
Court in the case of Jamal Uddin Ahmed and Others -Vs- State of Assam and
 WP(C) No. 1963 of 2013                                                Page 2 of 4

Others, reported in 2012 (1) GLT (FB) 1, set aside the seniority of the respondent
No.5 as held by the learned Single Judge by order 31.01.2012 in WP(C)
No.3140/2011 and by the impugned order dated 22.03.2013, the Inspector of
Schools, Cachar, Silchar without having any jurisdiction gave rise to a new issue
entrusting the respondent No.5 to hold the charge of Principal of said J Saha HS
School when the issue regarding seniority between him and the respondent No.5
was     pending      before    the   Commissioner     &     Secretary,   Secondary
Education Department as per the direction passed by the Division Bench of this
Court in WA No.47/2012. As such the petitioner submitted that the impugned
order dated 22.03.2013 cannot be considered as lawful since the issue of seniority
between the petitioner and the respondent No.5 is still pending.
        The respondent No.5 filed an affidavit in the matter stating that he is the
senior most teacher in the school and that the petitioner was appointed under the
‘Minimum Need Programme’ scheme and his initial appointment was not against
any regular vacant sanctioned post and that his service was regularized by an
order dated 23.08.1999 giving effect from 01.03.1996 when his service was
adjusted against the regular vacant sanctioned post and therefore, the petitioner’s
seniority in graduate cadre can be determined only w.e.f. 01.03.1996 whereas the
petitioner was regularly appointed in the graduate cadre way back on 29.05.1992
and therefore, said respondent No.5 claimed that he is senior to the petitioner in
the graduate cadre.
        It is a fact that the Hon’ble Division Bench by its order dated 16.11.2012
passed in WA No.47/2012 set aside and quashed the seniority of the respondent
No.5 above the petitioner and finding the claim of seniority made by both the
petitioner and the respondent No.5, the Court in said writ appeal directed the
Commissioner & Secretary in the Secondary Education Department to decide the
issue of seniority between them after hearing both of the parties and when the
said matter was pending before the concerned Commissioner & Secretary
regarding the dispute of seniority between them, without considering the order
dated 16.11.2012 of the Division Bench of this Court passed in WA No.47/2012,
the Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar issued the impugned order dated
22.03.2013 allowing the respondent No.5 to hold the charge of Principal of said J
  WP(C) No. 1963 of 2013                                                 Page 3 of 4

Saha HS School, without entrusting him with the financial power though he was
fully aware of the order dated 16.11.2012 of Division Bench of this Court. It is
also seen that the said Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar was a party
respondent in both the WP(C) No.3140/2011 as well as WA No.47/2012 and that
the Registry of this Court on 26.11.2012 vide Memo No.HCXXiii/2031-2035
forwarded a copy of the order dated 16.11.2012 passed in WA No.47/2012 to the
Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar.
        Considering the above, the impugned order dated 22.03.2012 passed by
the Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar allowing the respondent No.5 to hold the
charge of Principal of Judhisthir Saha HS School, Baherabazar, district-Cachar is
bad in law, since the dispute regarding the seniority between the petitioner and
said respondent No. 5 has not yet been ascertained by the Commissioner and
Secretary to the Govt. of Assam as directed by the Hon’ble Division Bench of this
Court on 16.11.2012 in WA No.47/2012.
        Accordingly, the impugned order dated 22.03.2012 passed by the
Inspector of Schools, Cachar, Silchar, being bad in law, is hereby set aside and
quashed.
        However, it is made clear that there shall not be a bar for regular selection
and appointment to the post of Principal in said Judhisthir Saha Higher Secondary
School, Baherabazar, district-Cachar.
        With the aforesaid observations and directions, this writ petition stands
disposed of.
                                                                   JUDGE
