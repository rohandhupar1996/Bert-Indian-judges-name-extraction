      P R E S E N T:
                        THE HON’BLE DR. JUSTICE A.K. RATH
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Date of Hearing: 30.11.2016 │ Date of Judgment: 09.12.2016
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. A.K. Rath, J.         The petitioners call in question the legality and
      propriety of the order dated 28.1.1995 passed by the Collector,
      Gajapati, opposite party no.2, in Regulation Appeal No.3/90, vide
      Annexure-6. By the said order, opposite party no.2 dismissed the
      appeal and confirmed the order dated 5.4.1990 passed by the Sub-
      Collector and Competent Authority, Parlakhemundi, opposite party
      no.3,   in   R.M.C.    No.20/89      vide   Annexure-5,     whereby      and

                                   2
whereunder the opposite party no.3 directed for restoration of the
land to opposite party no.1 under Regulation 7(1) of the Orissa
Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (By Scheduled
Tribes) Regulations, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as “Orissa
Regulation 2 of 1956”).
2.          A suo moto case being R.M.C. No.20/89 was instituted
against one K. Polaya by the opposite party no.3 on the basis of the
report of the Welfare Extension Officer, Guma under Regulation 3-A
of the Orissa Regulation 2 of 1956 in respect of the plot nos.500,
502, 506, 501 appertaining to khata no.76, area Ac.1.036 dec. of
mouza-Bapanbudi. The Welfare Extension Officer reported that the
schedule land belongs to opposite party no.1. But then in the
R.O.R., note of possession, the name of K. Polaya has been
indicated. The opposite party no.3 came to hold that note of
possession of K. Polaya in the ROR is erroneous and directed the
Tahasildar, Parlakhemundi to strike out the name of K. Polaya. He
further directed to restore possession of the opposite party no.1 and
imposed penalty of Rs.50/-.
3.          The legal heirs of K. Polaya, the present petitioners, filed
Regulation Appeal No.3/90 before the opposite party no.2 after his
death. Opposite party no.2 on a threadbare analysis of the materials
on record came to hold that the petitioners belong to Sundi caste

                                  3
and the opposite party no.1 is a scheduled tribe. He further held
that the unregistered sale deed was void under Orissa Regulation 2
of 1956, since no permission had been obtained under Orissa
Regulation 2 of 1956. The recording of the name of the predecessor
of the petitioners as a tenant in the ROR is in contravention of
Orissa Regulation 2 of 1956. Held so, appellate court dismissed the
appeal.
4.          Heard Mr. S.S. Rao, learned counsel on behalf of Mr.
Manoj Mishra, learned Senior Advocate along with Mr.B.K. Mohanty,
learned   counsel  for   the  petitioners  and   learned   Additional
Government Advocate for the State-opposite party nos.2 and 3.
None appears for the opposite party no.1 in spite of valid service of
notice.
5.          Mr. Rao, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted
that K. Polaya, predecessor in interest of the petitioners purchased
the land by means of unregistered sale deed from K. Narayanma,
who was not a scheduled caste/scheduled tribe. He purchased some
other lands from N. Sindu by means of unregistered sale deed in
respect of plot nos.831, 861, 864 measuring an area of Ac.0.034
dec., which are not the subject matter of R.M.C. No.20/89. Thus the
proceeding under Orissa Regulation 2 of 1956 is not maintainable.

                                   4
No opportunity was granted to K. Polaya by the opposite party no.3
and as such the order is vitiated.
6.           Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate for
the State-opposite party nos.2 and 3 supported the impugned order.
7.           Reliance placed on the alleged sale deed by Mr. Rao,
learned counsel for the petitioners is totally misplaced. The
unregistered sale deed vide Annexure-3 would show that the
consideration    amount    was  Rs.1500/-.   Under   Sec.17   of  the
Registration Act, 1908 the said document requires compulsory
registration. The same has not been done. Furthermore, the
description of the property has not been mentioned except the area.
Thus sale deed is void one. Both the forum below concurrently held
that opposite party no.1 is a scheduled tribe. He is the owner of the
land. The land is in occupation of the predecessor of the petitioners
and after him by the petitioners. Regulation 3-A of Orissa Regulation
2 of 1956 provides that where a person is found to be in
unauthorised occupation of any immovable property of a member of
the scheduled tribes by way of trespass or otherwise the competent
authority may, either on application by the owner or any person
interest therein, [or’ on information received from the Grama
Panchayat] or on his own motion, and after giving the parties
concerned an opportunity to being heard, order rejectment of the

                                             5
person so found to be in unauthorised occupation and shall cause
restoration of possession of such property to the said member of the
scheduled Tribes or to his heirs.
8.                     In view of the discussion made above, the inescapable
conclusion is that the proceeding under the Orissa Regulation 2 of
1956 is maintainable. The petitioners are in unauthorised occupation
of land. The forum below directed restoration of the land to the
opposite party no.1.
9.                     There being no infirmity or illegality in the orders passed
by the fora below, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the
same. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.
                                                      ……………………………….
                                                       Dr. A.K. Rath,J.
