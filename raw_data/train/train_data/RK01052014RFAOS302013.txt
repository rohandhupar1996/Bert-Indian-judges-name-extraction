Review Petition No.556/2013
1.      This review petition has been filed to seek review of order
dated August 12, 2013 passed by this Court in RFA No. 30/2013.
2.      The contention of the Review Petitioner is that there is an error
apparent on the face of the record as the date of the last cheque
(Cheque No. 563092) is 31.08.07 and not 09.10.07 and this cheque
was handed over to the Respondent on 21.08.07. The suit CS(OS)
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                               Page 1 of 8

No. 2150/2010 was filed by the Respondent only on 07.10.2010,
which is after 3 years from the date on which the cheque could first
be presented by the Respondent. Therefore, the suit filed by the
Respondent is barred by limitation and hence the appeal should have
been allowed.
3.      Notice of the Review Petition was issued to the Respondent. In
the reply filed by the Respondent to the Review Petition, the
Respondent had at the outset taken a preliminary objection that the
Petitioner (Defendant-Appellant) has concealed material facts in
respect of cheque No. 563092 dated 31.08.2007 which was handed
over to the Respondent on 21.08.2007. The said cheque given by the
Petitioner to the Respondent was a post-dated cheque (dated
31.08.07), which was presented by the Respondent for encashment
firstly on 3rd September, 2007 in Citi Bank, South Extension Branch
which was returned unpaid due to “funds insufficient” in the account
of the Petitioner on 05.09.2007 as per the intimation sent by the bank.
The Respondent thereafter again presented the said cheque for
encashment on 1.10.2007 which was again dishonoured due to “funds
insufficient” vide Bank Return Memo dated 03.10.2007. Thereafter
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                       Page 2 of 8

the cheque was presented for encashment on 08.10.2007 and was
credited on 09.10.2007. This implies that the final payment in the
account of the Respondent was credited on 09.10.2007, which is the
admitted date of payment by the Petitioner as well. The cause of
action, therefore, arose on 09.10.2007 and the suit was filed on 7 th
October, 2010, which is well within limitation.
4.      It is further submitted by the Respondent that the affidavit
seeking leave to defend filed by the Petitioners before the learned
Single Judge had no plea regarding limitation. The Petitioners even
admitted before the learned Single Judge that no plea regarding the
date of the cheque had been raised by them in the affidavit seeking
leave to defend.         Therefore, at the present stage of review, the
Petitioners cannot be allowed to raise new pleas based on concealed
facts. However, it was fairly conceded by Sh. Sanjay Jain, learned
senior counsel for the Respondent that the petition for the purpose of
review of orders/judgment dated 12.08.2013 may be allowed to the
extent that the date of the cheque which is wrongly mentioned as
09.10.2007 instead of 31.08.2007, being a typographical error the
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                        Page 3 of 8

same may be corrected, though it will not have any effect on the final
outcome.
5.      The Petitioner filed rejoinder to the reply of the Respondent
wherein no explanation has been given by the Petitioner as to why the
aforesaid material fact was suppressed by the Petitioner even in the
review petition filed by the Petitioner and as a matter of fact a strange
plea of acquiescence and waiver has been raised in paragraphs 5 to 7
of the Rejoinder, which read as under:-
            “5. Acquiescence and waiver: The cheque
            No.563092 dated 31.08.2007 was presented for
            endorsement on two occasions i.e, 3/9/2007
            secondly on 1/10/2007 and was returned unpaid,
            has not been pleaded by the Respondent in Suit
            CS(OS) 2150/2010. Ultimately the respondent had
            the said cheque encashed on 09.10.2007 shows
            that the Respondent had acquiesce the same
            action. The stand taken by the Respondent is
            barred by the principles of acquiescence and
            waiver.
            6. The cheque bearing No.563092 dated
            31.08.2007 was honoured on 09.10.2007, this fact
            is admitted by the Respondent in its reply. In the
            decision the Hon’ble Apex court in the case of
            Jiwanlal Achariya Vs. Rameshwarlal Agarwal
            (AIR 1967 SC 1118), has held at para 8,
                “This brings us to the question of limitation.
                The facts are not in dispute now the
                promissory note was executed on February
                4, 1954. On the same date a post-dated
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                         Page 4 of 8

                cheque bearing the date February 25, 1954
                was given by the defendant/appellant to the
                plaintiff/respondent, the intention being that
                on being realized it would be credited
                towards part payment. It was realized
                sometime after February 25, 1954 and was
                credited towards part payment”.........
                “........we are, therefore, of opinion that as a
                post-dated cheque was given on February 4,
                1954 and it was dated February 25, 1954
                and as this was not a case of unconditional
                acceptance, the payment for the purpose of
                S.20 of the Limitation Act could only be on
                February 25, 1954 when the cheque could
                have been presented at earliest for payment.
                As in the present case the cheque was
                honoured it must be held that the payment
                was made on February 25, 1954.”
            7. In the light of the above case where a post-
            dated cheque is accepted conditionally and is
            honoured, the payment of the purpose of Section
            20 of the Limitation Act can only be the date of the
            cheque and cannot be on the date which is
            honoured or credited. As such, the facts are
            similar in to the present case, the post-dated
            cheque bearing No.563092 dated 31.08.2007 was
            handed over on 21.08.200 and been finally
            honoured on 09.10.2007. For purpose of section
            20 of the Limitation Act the date of the cheque
            (31.08.2007) is relevant. The suit filed by the
            Respondent on 07.10.2010 was barred by
            limitation.”
6.      Further, in response to the preliminary objections raised by the
Respondent with regard to material suppression of facts by the
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                           Page 5 of 8

Petitioner in its review petition, the Petitioner in its rejoinder stated
that in respect to the date of cause of action, the law is settled that
cause of action arose on the date of issuance of the cheque and not on
the date of its realization.         Thus, clearly, the Petitioner does not
dispute that it failed to disclose the fact that the cheque dated 31 st
August, 2007 (delivered on 21.08.2007 to the Respondent) was
dishonoured on presentation before it was finally honoured on the
third presentation on 9.10.2007.
7.      The above being the factual position and there being a
typographical error in our judgment dated August 12, 2013, we
modify our judgment to the extent that wherever the date of the
cheque has been mentioned as 9.10.2007, the same shall be read as
31.08.2007. Consequentially and as a result of the said modification
at page 9 of the judgment the words “the last of the cheques handed
over by the Appellants to the Respondent was dated 9.10.2007” will
read as “the last of the cheques handed over by the Appellants to the
Respondent was dated 31.08.2007, which was realized on
9.10.2007”. Again at page 9 of the judgment, the sentence “The
appellants in the instant case have not disputed that the last of the
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                            Page 6 of 8

cheques is dated 9.10.2007. Thus, even assuming (though there is no
authentic document placed on record in this regard) that the cheque
dated 9.10.2007 was delivered to the Respondent on 21.08.2007, he
could not have presented the same for payment prior to 9.10.2007”.
will read as “The appellants in the instant case have not disputed that
the last of the cheques is dated 31.08.2007. Thus, even assuming
(though there is no authentic document placed on record in this
regard) that the cheque dated 31.08.2007 was delivered to the
Respondent on 21.08.2007, he could not have presented the same for
payment prior to 31.08.2007”.
8.      We further modify the words in paragraph 12 at page 13 of the
judgment “that the cheques dated 21st August, 2007 and 9.10.2007
were handed over to the Respondent at Bangalore.” to read as “that
the cheques dated 21st August, 2007 and 31.08.2007 were handed
over to the Respondent at Bangalore.”
9.      As in the present case, the cheque was honoured on 9.10.2007,
it must be held that the payment was made on 9.10.2007. We are,
therefore, of the opinion that the fresh period of limitation began on
9.10.2007, which was the date of realization of the post dated cheque,
R.P. No.556/2013 in RFA(OS) No.30/2013                       Page 7 of 8

and therefore the typographical error which has crept into the
judgment will in no manner have a bearing on the findings and the
conclusions arrived at by us.          Insofar as the legal position is
concerned, the Review Petitioner in the Petition itself has frankly
stated that the exposition of the legal position in the judgment cannot
be faulted.
10.     The inevitable conclusion is that the Review Petition is partly
allowed to the extent set out above in paras 7 and 8. The rest of the
prayers made in the petition which are clearly based on an
afterthought and are even otherwise not tenable in the fact situation
are declined.
11.     CM No. 2093/2014 is also rejected.
