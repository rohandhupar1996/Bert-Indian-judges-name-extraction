        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
                                JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      The Appeal is for enhancement of compensation of `3,24,200/- awarded
        by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the Claims Tribunal) for the
        death of Naresh Kumar, a bachelor, aged 22 years, in a motor vehicle
        accident which occurred on 20.02.2001.
2.      It is urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant that the age of the
        deceased’s mother at the time of the accident as per the Ration Card was
        38 years, the appropriate multiplier was therefore, 15 instead of 13 taken
        by the Claims Tribunal.
3.      The Claims Tribunal while computing the loss of dependency took the
        deceased’s income as `2600/- per month; added 50% towards future
        prospects and applied the multiplier of ‘13’ to compute the loss of
        dependency as `3,04,200/-.
MAC. APP. 151/2005                                             Page 1 of 3

4.      The Claims Tribunal further awarded a sum of ` 20,000/- towards non-
        pecuniary damages to award the overall compensation of `3,24,200/-.
5.      Since there was no evidence with regard to the deceased’s future
        prospects, the Appellant would be entitled to an increase of 30% towards
        inflation on the strength of Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company
        Ltd. & Ors., 2012 (4) SCALE 559. There would be deduction of 50%
        towards personal and living expenses and the appropriate multiplier at the
        age of 38 years would be 15.
6.      The loss of dependency thus comes to `3,04,200/- (2600/- + 30% x 1/2 x
        12 x 15).
7.      On adding a sum of `25,000/- towards loss of love and affection and
        `10,000/- each towards loss to estate and funeral expenses, the overall
        compensation comes to `3,49,200/- as against `3,24,200/- awarded by the
        Claims Tribunal.
8.      The compensation thus stands enhanced by `25,000/- which shall carry
        interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the Petition till its
        payment.
9.      Respondent No.1 National Insurance Company Limited is directed to
        deposit the enhanced compensation along with interest with the Claims
        Tribunal within six weeks.
10.     The enhanced compensation shall enure for the benefit of Appellant No.2,
        the deceased’s mother.
11.     The Appeal is allowed in above terms.

12.     Pending Applications stand disposed of.
