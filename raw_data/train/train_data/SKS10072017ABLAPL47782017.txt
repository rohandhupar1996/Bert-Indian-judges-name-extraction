S. K. SAHOO, J.           The petitioners Chhotalal Mohanta, Nihar Ranjan
        Modi, Dinakrushna Dash @ Das and Prakash Agarwalla have filed
        this application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. in connection with
        Jharpokharia P.S. Case No.57 of 2016 corresponding to G.R.
        Case No.02 of 2017 pending in the Court of learned Sessions

                               2
Judge -cum- Special Judge, Mayurbhanj, Baripada (hereafter ‘the
Trial Judge’) for commission of offences punishable under
sections 447, 332, 385, 353, 294, 506, 427 read with section
34 of the Indian Penal Code, section 3(1)(x)(i) of SC & ST (PA)
Act and section 3 of P.D.P.P. Act, 1984 and section 7 of Criminal
Law Amendment Act.
2.          The case was instituted on the first information
report submitted by one Kulamani Bhoi, Asst. Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes in charge, Jamsola check gate before the
Inspector   in-charge    of  Jharpokharia    police   station  on
23.05.2016.
            After completion of investigation, charge sheet was
submitted on 17.02.2017     under sections 447, 294, 332, 353,
385, 506, 427 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code,
section 3 of P.D.P.P. Act and section 3 (1)(r)(s)(va) of the SC &
ST (PA) Act against the four petitioners as well as co-accused
Krushna Chandra Mohapatra and accordingly, on 23.02.2017 the
learned Trial Judge took cognizance of such offences and issued
summons in respect of the petitioners as well as co-accused
Krushna Chandra Mohapatra. On 16.03.2017 the petitioners filed
a petition under section 205 of Cr.P.C. before the learned Trial
Judge for dispensing with their personal attendance which was

                                3
considered and rejected on the very day and the case was
posted to 28.03.2017 for appearance of the petitioners. The
learned counsel appearing for the petitioners before the learned
Trial Judge filed an application on 28.03.2017 seeking time for
appearance of the petitioners as well as co-accused Krushna
Chandra Mohapatra which was allowed and the case was posted
to 01.05.2017 for appearance of the accused persons and the
informant.
             While the matter stood thus before the learned Trial
Judge in G.R. Case No.2 of 2017, the petitioners filed this
application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. on 30.03.2017 seeking
for anticipatory bail. The matter was taken up on 18.04.2017
and since the case involved the offence under section 3 of the SC
& ST (PA) Act, in view of the section 15-A of the said Act, the
learned counsel for the petitioners was permitted to implead the
informant as opposite party no.2 and notice was directed to be
issued to the informant and as an interim measure, all the four
petitioners were directed not to be arrested in connection with
case till the next date on condition that the petitioners shall co-
operate with the investigation as and when required.
             When the matter was placed before this Court on
18.04.2017, even though it is mentioned in the body of the

                                 4
petition that the charge sheet has been submitted but the same
was not brought to the notice of this Court for which a direction
was passed that the petitioners shall co-operate with the
investigation as and when required while granting interim
protection.
            There is no dispute that an application under section
438 of Cr.P.C. is maintainable even after submission of charge
sheet and taking of cognizance of offences basing on such
charge sheet. (Ref:- (2003) 26 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC)
641, Bharat Chaudhary -Vrs.- State of Bihar)
            After filing of the requisites as per the order dated
18.04.2017 by the learned counsel for the petitioners for
issuance of notice on opposite party no.2, the case was listed on
17.05.2017 for orders when a Misc. Case was filed by the
learned counsel for the petitioners in Court for appropriate
orders which was numbered as Misc. Case No.594 of 2017. It is
averred in the Misc. Case that when the petitioners appeared
before the Court along with their counsel and the learned
counsel filed an application under section 437 of Cr.P.C. for
release of the accused persons, the learned Court below without
considering the application and without looking into the order

                                  5
passed by this Court in this anticipatory bail application,
remanded them to judicial custody by order dated 15.05.2017.
            This Court took up the Misc. Case on the very day,
asked the registry to register the Misc. Case and sent a copy of
the Misc. Case along with the annexures to the learned Trial
Judge to submit an explanation on the averments made in the
Misc. Case in a sealed cover and simultaneously directed the
petitioners who were stated to be in jail custody to be released
on bail. Accordingly, the petitioners nos. 1, 2 and 4 were
released from custody on 22.05.2017.
            In pursuance of the order dated 17.05.2017 passed
in Misc. Case No. 594 of 2017, the learned Trial Judge submitted
his explanation in a sealed cover. I have gone through the
explanation meticulously.
            On going through the petition for anticipatory bail
filed by the petitioners, it is apparent that there is no mention of
issuance of summons against the petitioners by the learned Trial
Judge after taking cognizance of the offences as per the order
dated 23.02.2017 as well as rejection of the petition under
section 205 of Cr.P.C. vide order dated 16.03.2017.
            In the Misc. Case No. 594 of 2017 filed in Court on
17.05.2017 for appropriate orders, it is indicated as follows:-

                                  6
             “2. That on 18.04.2017 this Hon’ble Court after
             due course of hearing directed to implead the
             informant as opp. party no.2 and as an interim
             measure directed that the petitioners shall not
             be arrested in connection with Jharpokharia P.S.
             Case No.57 of 2016, corresponding to G.R. Case
             No.2 of 2017 pending before the learned Special
             Judge, Mayurbhanj, Baripada till next date on
             the condition that the petitioners shall cooperate
             with the investigation as and when required.
             3. That as the matter stood thus the I.O.
             submitted    charge-sheet     for  commission   of
             offences         under         sections      447/
             294/332/353/385/506/427/34 of IPC along with
             section   3   P.D.P.P.  Act    read   with section
             3(1)(r)(s)/2(v) of SC/ST (P.A.) Act and after
             charge sheet submitted the learned Spl. Judge,
             Mayurbhanj,     Baripada   issued   summons   and
             directed the petitioners for appearance.”
             The wordings in paragraph 3 “as the matter stood
thus the I.O. submitted charge-sheet” is factually incorrect
inasmuch as charge sheet was submitted on 17.02.2017 and not
after the interim order dated 18.04.2017.
             In paragraph 4 of the Misc. Case No. 594 of 2017, it
is mentioned that as per the direction of the learned Special
Judge, Mayurbhanj, Baripada, the petitioners appeared before

                                  7
the Court. This is also not factually correct inasmuch as
petitioner no.3 Dinakrushna Dash @ Das has not appeared
before the learned Trial Judge on 15.05.2017. It is also not
correct as averred in paragraph-4 of the Misc. Case that an
application under section 437 of Cr.P.C. was filed for release of
petitioner no.3 Dinakrushna Dash @ Das.
             The learned Trial Judge in his explanation has
highlighted that on 15.05.2017 the petitioners nos.1, 2 and 4
along with co-accused Krushna Chandra Mohapatra appeared in
Court along with their counsels and two bail applications were
filed, one for co-accused Krushna Chandra Mohapatra and other
for petitioners nos. 1, 2 and 4 and after their appearance, they
were taken into judicial custody before hearing of the bail
petitions. It is further indicated in the explanation that when the
bail petitions were taken up, the learned counsel submitted a
petition   for   time  for   the  appearance    of  petitioner no.3
Dinakrushna Dash @ Das and also filed ‘not press’ memo of the
bail petitions wherein it is mentioned that he does not want to
press the bail application. It is further stated in the explanation
that since no further bail petition was filed and the accused
persons had appeared in Court and taken into judicial custody
therefore, he had no other option but to send them to custody.

                                  8
             In Misc. Case No. 594 of 2017 which was filed on
17.05.2017, this aspect regarding not pressing of the bail
petitions after the appearance of the petitioners nos. 1, 2 and 4
and after they were taken into judicial custody has not been
reflected.
             Even though the interim protection order aspect has
been mentioned in the bail petition filed on behalf of the
petitioners nos. 1, 2 and 4 before the learned Trial Judge but
since that petition was not pressed, I am of the humble view that
no illegality has been committed by the learned Trial Judge to
send those petitioners to jail custody as by then those petitioners
were already taken into judicial custody after their appearance.
             Therefore, it is clear that not only the main petition
which was filed for anticipatory bail but also the Misc. Case
No.594 of 2017 which was filed in Court on 17.05.2017 suffers
from suppression of materials facts and also full of misleading
statements.
             One is expected to come to the Court with clean
hands and present his case in a truthful manner and should not
indulge in giving misleading statements and suppression of
materials facts. If the Court finds out that the facts have not
been fully and fairly stated to it by the applicant, the Court will

                                9
set aside any action which it has taken on the faith of the
imperfect statement. If the applicant makes a false statement or
suppresses material fact or attempts to mislead the Court, the
Court may dismiss the action on that ground alone. An applicant
who suppresses the material facts from the Court is guilty of
suppressio veri and suggestio f alsi i.e. suppression or failure to
disclose what a party is bound to disclose may amount to fraud.
            It is the settled proposition of law that a false
statement made in the Court or in the pleadings, intentionally to
mislead the Court and obtain a favourable order, amounts to
criminal contempt, as it tends to impede the administration of
justice. It adversely affects the interest of the public in the
administration of justice. Every party is under a legal obligation
to make truthful statements before the Court, for the reason that
causing an obstruction in the due course of justice undermines
and obstructs the very flow of the unsoiled stream of justice,
which has to be kept clear and pure, and no one can be
permitted to take liberties with it by soiling its purity. (Ref:-
Naraindas -Vrs.- Government of Madhya Pradesh and Ors.,
A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1252; The Advocate General, State of
Bihar -Vrs.- Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries and Anr.,

                                 10
AIR 1980 SC 946; and Afzal and Anr. -Vrs.- State of
Haryana and Ors., (1996) 7 Supreme Court Cases 397).
            In K.D. Sharma v. Steel Authority of India
Limited and Ors. reported in (2008) 12 Supreme Court
Cases 481, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
            “Prerogative    writs    are   issued   for   doing
            substantial justice. It is, therefore, of utmost
            necessity that the petitioner approaching the
            writ court must come with clean hands, put
            forward all the facts before the court without
            concealing or suppressing anything and seek an
            appropriate   relief.   If  there   is  no   candid
            disclosure of relevant and material facts or the
            petitioner is guilty of misleading the court, his
            petition may be dismissed at the threshold
            without considering the merits of the claim.”
            Since   basing   on   the    misleading   and  factually
incorrect averments made in the Misc. Case No.564 of 2017, the
petitioners were directed to be released on bail by the learned
Trial Judge, this Court thinks it is proper to recall the bail order
dated 17.05.2017. Accordingly, the petitioners nos. 1, 2 and 4
namely Chhotalal Mahanta, Nihar Ranjan Modi and Prakash
Agarwalla who have been released on bail by virtue of the order
dated 17.05.2017 passed in Misc. Case No.594 of 2017 are

                                     11
directed to surrender before the learned Sessions Judge -cum-
Special Judge, Mayurbhanj, Baripada in G.R. Case No. 02 of
2017 within a week from today failing which the learned Trial
Judge shall take appropriate steps for their arrest in accordance
with law. If the aforesaid three petitioners appear and move for
bail, their bail applications shall be considered in accordance with
law on its own merits.
                  Send a copy of the order to the learned Sessions
Judge -cum- Special Judge, Mayurbhanj, Baripada immediately.
                  Free copy of the order be handed over to the learned
counsel for the State
                  Accordingly, the ABLAPL application is disposed of.
