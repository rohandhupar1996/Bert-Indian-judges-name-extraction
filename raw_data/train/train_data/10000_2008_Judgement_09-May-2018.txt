Reason:

                                                                              2
2.    A-1 Karuppaya, son of appellants got married to one Malathi,
daughter of Karuthekannan and Vellathai (PWs 9 and 15 respectively) on
26.02.2001. According to the prosecution, at the time of marriage there
were dowry demands and accordingly 50 sovereigns of gold, 2 sovereigns of
hand chain, 3 sovereigns of gold chain, cash of Rs.50,000/- and certain
house hold articles were given by the parents of Malathi. After marriage the
couple started living at Cuddalore. In June 2002 the couple was blessed
with a child. It is alleged that thereafter A-1 prevented said Malathi to enter
the matrimonial home unless demands for additional dowry were satisfied.
Panchayat meeting was held on 26.04.2003 but no compromise could be
arrived at. A petition was sent by Malathi to the office of Chief Minister on
18.07.2003 whereafter Cuddalore police conducted inquiry. A-1 gave an
undertaking that he would live with Malathi and accordingly he brought
Malathi to the matrimonial home at Cuddalore on 08.12.2003.
3.    On the intervening night of 8th and 9th of December, 2003, there was a
quarrel between A-1 and Malathi and thereafter A-1 is said to have attacked
her brutally with aruval. On 09.12.2003 at about 10.00 A.M. A-1 confessed
his guilt before PW-1 Village Officer and surrendered himself.           Crime
No.1587 of 2003 was registered pursuant to the information given by PW-1,
Village Officer and the investigation was undertaken.

                                                                           3
4.     PW-20 the Investigating Officer inspected the place of occurrence and
recorded statement of A-1 in the presence of PW-19 and one Ramalingam
under Exh.P-23 pursuant to which a knife was recovered. Body of Said
Malathi was sent for post mortem which was conducted by PWs 10 and 11
who found following injuries:
     “(1)     Left side scalp there is an incised injury extending from
     the forehead to middle line of scalp about 9-10 x 1-4cm x bone

5.      Charges were framed against A-1, A-2 and A-3 for offences
punishable under Sections 498A, 302 read with Section 34 IPC and also
under Section 4-A(1)(2)(i) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of
Women Act, 1998 (1998 Act, for short). Court of Sessions at Cuddalore by
its judgment and order dated 11.09.2006 in Sessions Case No.82/2006 found
A-1 guilty of offences punishable under Section 302, 498A IPC and under
Section 4-A(1)(2)(i) of 1998 Act. The appellants were acquitted of the

                                                                           5
charges under Section 302 IPC and Section 4-A(1)(2)(i) of 1998 Act but
were convicted for the offences under Section 498A IPC and sentenced to
undergo three months rigorous imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs. 1000/-,
in default whereof to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month. During
the course of its judgment, the trial court observed:
       “P.W.27 in her deposition would state that on 11-10-2003
       relating to the letter forwarded from the Chief Minister’s Cell to
       the all Women Police Station, Cuddalore, an enquiry was
       conducted by her and at that time the deceased Malathi, A.1 and
       the parents of both sides were present, however, on the accused
       side time was sought for taking back Malathi. From her
       deposition it is clear that on 11-10-2003 there was no talk about
       the dowry problem. Hence, in such a case, in the absence of the
       letter sent to the Chief Minister’s Cell having been filed before
       this Court, the defence theory has to be accepted to the effect
       that in the letter sent to the Chief Minister’s Cell there was no
       reference about the dowry problem and the enquiry at the police
       station also was not on dowry problem and to that much extent
       the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused relating to
       dowry problem. As such, the evidence of PWs 26 and 27 in no
       way show that there was any talk regarding dowry problem. In
       such a case there is force in the contention of the defence side
       that the problem between the parties is not mainly centered on
       dowry, even though as per the evidence discussed supra there
       were talks about the gold jewels and payment of money.”
6.     The appellants challenged their conviction and sentence by filing
Criminal Appeal No.843 of 2006 while A-1 preferred Criminal Appeal No.
1050 of 2006. Both the appeals were disposed of by common judgment and
order dated 04.12.2007, which is presently under appeal.       The High Court

                                                                               6
affirmed the view taken by the trial court and maintained the conviction and
sentence of all three accused.
7.      The appellants being aggrieved, preferred this appeal by special leave.
Initially, the appellants were granted exemption from surrendering and later
they were ordered to be released on bail to the satisfaction of the trial court,
which benefit the appellants have enjoyed all through. It appears that the
conviction and sentence recorded against A-1 has attained finality and in this
appeal we are concerned only with conviction and sentence of appellants
under Section 498A IPC. Appearing for the appellants, Mr. V. Prabhakar,
learned Advocate invited our attention to the observations of the trial court
as quoted hereinabove. In his submission the appellants were entitled to
acquittal. Mr. M. Yogesh Kanna, learned Advocate for the State, however,
supported the judgments rendered by the courts below.
8.      The evidence in the present case shows that after the letter was sent by
Malathi to the office of Chief Minister, inquiries were conducted by the
police. The evidence further indicates that at that juncture, no complaint
was made by Malathi or her parents regarding any dowry related
harassment. Further, she was brought to Cuddalore on 08.12.2003 where the
couple used to live separately and the incident in question occurred on the
intervening night between 8th and 9th December, 2003. In the circumstances,

                                                                           7
the evidence on record is completely inadequate to bring home the charge
against the appellants. We have gone through the entirety of the matter and
in our considered view, both the appellants are entitled to acquittal.
9.     We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the judgment and order
of conviction and sentence as recorded against the appellants.          The
appellants are acquitted of the charge of Section 498A IPC leveled against
them. The appellants are on bail. Their bail bonds stand discharged.
