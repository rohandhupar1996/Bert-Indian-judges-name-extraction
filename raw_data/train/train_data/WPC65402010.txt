Date of Judgment :             20.07.2017.
                          JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
1.      Heard Ms. Dutta, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner. Also
heard Mr. D. Nath, learned Senior Govt. Advocate, Assam, appearing for the
respondents.
2.      Assailing the order dated 09.08.2010, by means of which the fair price
shop licence earlier granted in favour of the petitioner under the Assam
Public Distribution of Articles Order, 1982 was cancelled and the consumers
were tagged with the nearest Agent, the present writ petition has been filed.
3.      The brief facts of the case, giving rise to filing of this writ petition, is that
the writ petitioner was earlier issued a licence bearing No.Laruah/68                  for
WP(C) No.6540/2010                                                        Page 1 of 4

running a fair price shop. The said licence was renewed from time to time.
During the period of operation of the said licence, the Food & Civil Supplies
Inspector of the locality had conducted a surprise visit to the fair price shop
of the petitioner on 06.03.2010 whereafter, several anomalies were found in
the stock register, lifting book and other registers maintained by the
petitioner. Accordingly, by the order dated 16.03.2010 the licence of the
petitioner was suspended and he was asked to show cause. After the show
cause reply was received, an enquiry was conducted and the Inspector of
Food & Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Dibrugarh had submitted a
report dated 12.03.2010 wherein, categorical findings had been recorded to
the effect that the petitioner had been misusing the licence thereby
diverting quantities of rice and Sk. Oil meant for the consumers for being sold
in the open market at a higher price.
4.      Taking note of the enquiry report dated 12.03.2010 the Deputy
Director and Licencing Authority, Food & Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs,
Dibrugarh, had issued the impugned order dated 09.08.2010 cancelling the
licence of the petitioner. Aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioner is
before this Court.
5.      Ms.  Dutta,   learned   counsel    for  the   petitioner, submits    that
subsequently, the petitioner could collect certificates from as many as 30
consumers to show that the findings recorded by the enquiry officer was not
correct. On such basis, she has prayed for setting aside the impugned order
dated 09.08.2010 and for restoration of the licence in favour of her client.
WP(C) No.6540/2010                                                  Page 2 of 4

6.     Opposing the said submission of the petitioner’s counsel, Mr. D. Nath,
learned Additional Senior Govt. Advocate, Assam, submits that the
impugned order dated 09.08.2010 has been issued after conducting a
proper enquiry in the matter on the basis of public complaints received by
the authorities. Before taking the impugned decision, the petitioner was also
given sufficient opportunity of being heard in the matter. Such being the
position, submits Mr. Nath, there is no infirmity in the order dated 09.08.2010
warranting interference by this Court.
7.     I have gone through the materials available on record which goes to
show that the petitioner had the opportunity of submitting as many as two
show cause replies. One of the specific allegation brought against the
petitioner is that he had diverted rice under the BPL and AAY scheme
amounting to about 27.98 quintals and sold the same in the black market so
as to make undue profit, thereby depriving as many as 83 families who were
entitled to the same. On a careful scrutiny of the show cause reply submitted
by the petitioner I find that no explanation, whatsoever, has been furnished
as regards the said allegation levelled against him. From the enquiry report, it
further appears that specific findings of fact regarding anomalies in the
operation of the fair price shop run by the petitioner had been recorded on
the basis of entries in stock register and other registers maintained by the
petitioner. There is nothing on record to indicate that such findings of fact
are perverse in the eye of law.
8.     If the petitioner had acted in violation of the conditions of licence as
well as the provisions of the Assam Public Distribution of Articles Order, 1982,
then his licence would be liable to be cancelled. In the present case, the
WP(C) No.6540/2010                                                  Page 3 of 4

authorities had given fair opportunity to the petitioner to show cause and it
was only on reaching a satisfaction based on an enquiry that the petitioner
had acted in violation of the conditions of the licence and the Order of 1982
that the impugned order has been passed.
9.     In the facts and circumstances of the case I do not find any valid
ground to interfere with the impugned order dated 09.08.2010. Accordingly,
the writ petition is held to be devoid of any merit and is dismissed.
       There would be no order as to cost.
                                                                 JUDGE
