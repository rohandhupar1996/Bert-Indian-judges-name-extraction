Advocate for the Petitioners:                  Mr. M. Khan &
                                               Mr. S.K. Roy.

Date of hearing & judgment:             11-07-2017.
                               JUDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
           Heard Mr. M. Khan, the learned counsel for the eight petitioners. The
respondent Nos.1, 3, 4 & 5 are represented by Mr. A. Deka, the learned standing
counsel for the Department of Elementary Education. The learned standing counsel for
the Finance Department Mr. P. Nayak, appears for the respondent No.2.
2.         The petitioners were appointed as graduate science teachers in M.E. Schools of
Bongaigaon District, under the BEEO’s appointment order(s) dated 28.2.1994
(Annexure-1 series). The appointment order(s) reflect that the appointments were
made against newly created posts in middle schools. The services of the appointees
were regularized on 1.3.2001 (Annexure-3 series) and the regularized groups were
adjusted by the DEEO on 20.3.2003 (Annexure-7 series). The issue here is whether the
regularized teachers are entitled to their arrear salary between August, 2000—
19.3.2003, as they were paid their arrears only w.e.f. 20.3.2003.
3.         In Assam, during 1994—96, large number of illegal appointments of teachers
were made in different schools. When the matter came to light and salaries to the
appointees could not be disbursed, the Government in the Cabinet meeting on
21.2.2000, had decided to verify whether the appointments were made through a legal
process, against existing vacancies. The S. Monohoran Committee was then constituted,
which categorized the petitioners as selected but irregularly appointed, against non-
sanctioned posts. Accordingly decision was taken by the Cabinet to regularize the
service of this group and to disburse their salary w.e.f. August, 2000. For the other
group, categorized as illegal because they were appointed without selection against
Writ Petition (C) No.4863/2008                                                        2 of 4

non-existent posts by the Monohoran Committee, the Government decided to terminate
the service of the illegal appointees.
4.         On the basis of the above decision, the petitioners who were appointed as
science teachers in M.V. Schools on 28.2.1994, were regularized in service, under the
order dated 1.3.2001 (Annexure-3 series), issued by the DEEO, Bongaigaon.
Subsequently their services were adjusted in different schools on 20.3.2003 (Annexure-
7 series), by the same officer.
5.         Following the regularization of service and adjustment, the petitioners are
receiving the current salary since 20.3.2003 but their primary grievance is non-payment
of their arrear salary between August, 2000—19.3.2003, notwithstanding the stipulation
for disbursal of current salary w.e.f. August, 2000, under the Govt. circular dated
10.8.2000 (Annexure-2).
6.         The petitioners contend that when the appointments were made through a
formal selection process and service was regularized through a Cabinet decision, the
Government is duty bound to disburse the salary of the regularized teachers, w.e.f.
August, 2000, in terms of the Govt. circular dated 10.8.2000. Mr. M. Khan, the learned
counsel accordingly submits that the decision to disburse the arrear salary only from
20.3.2003, is illegal and can have no legal basis.
7.         Opposing the claim for arrear salary from the earlier date, Mr. A. Deka, the
learned standing counsel refers to the communication dated 6.3.2003 (Annexure-6), of
the Director of the Elementary Education to project that individual undertaking was
obtained at the time of service adjustment not to claim arrear salary for past service
and accordingly it is argued that since past claim was waived by the teachers, they are
disentitled to claim arrear salary for past service, prior to 19.3.2003.
8.         On the appointment of teachers, the Monohoran Committee found that the
petitioners were appointed after due selection and accordingly those appointments were
categorized as irregular as opposed to the illegal category. It is also not disputed that
the petitioners have rendered service without any break, since they were appointed.
The services of the appointees were regularized under the Cabinet decision as reflected
in the circular dated 10.8.2000 (Annexure-2) and the circular itself states that upon
regularization, salary w.e.f. August, 2000, will be disbursed to the teachers.
9.         The question is whether the State’s opposition to the claim for arrear salary can
be sustained on the basis of the undertaking(s) obtained from the regularized teachers,
under the Director’s communication of 6.3.2003 (Annexure-6).
10.        When the appointments were made in 1994, only three months’ salary was paid
and the appointed teachers were made to serve without salary until their services were
Writ Petition (C) No.4863/2008                                                       3 of 4

regularized and adjusted, on the basis of the Govt. circular dated 10.8.2000 (Annexure-
2). At the stage of regularization, the teachers were in a stage of despair and were
hardly in a position to resist the signing of the undertaking(s), forcing them to abandon
their claim for arrear salary. It is obvious here that the State, by use of unequal
bargaining power, had forced the teachers to furnish undertakings to waive their arrear
salary claim. All such covenant to be legally enforceable, must be executed voluntarily
and unconscionable contract, enforced through superior bargaining power cannot be
enforced to deny the legitimate claim for arrear salary, for the service rendered by the
teachers. It is also obligatory for the employer to pay salary when service is extracted
and it will hardly be fair to allow the State to use their superior bargaining power to
enforce the unconscionable undertaking, to deprive the regularly selected teachers of
their arrear salaries.
11.        This Court, in Usha Rani Goswami vs. State of Assam reported in (2011) 4 GLR
392, had declared that undertaking(s), which are obtained by compulsion to waive off
the arrear salary claim is a unconscionable covenant and such one sided condition
cannot be enforced to deny the arrear salary, for the regularized teachers. Hence
bearing in mind the ratio laid down in this case and also by the Supreme Court in
Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs. Brojo Nath Ganguly, reported in
(1986) 3 SCC 156, it is held that the petitioners are entitled to the arrear salary from
August, 2000—19.3.2003. Concluding thus, the respondents are ordered to take
necessary steps for disbursal of arrear salary to the petitioners, for the relevant period.
The process for disbursal of dues be completed expeditiously and preferably within six
months and it is ordered so accordingly.
12.        A copy of this order be furnished for due communication to Mr. A. Deka and Mr.
P. Nayak, who represent the Department of Elementary Education and the Finance
Department, respectively.
13.        The case is accordingly allowed, without any order on cost, with the above
direction.
                                                                              JUDGE
