                                    learned Assistant Solicitor General of India

                          JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
       This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is filed against the
order dated 23.8.2012 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal,
Guwahati Bench, whereby it has allowed respondent’s OA No.37/2012.
                                                                      Page 1 of 3

        The respondent was appointed as Lower Division Clerk by the Survey
Department of India on 19.5.2005. He then appeared in the Limited
Departmental Competitive Examination and on the basis of his position in
the merit list, vide order dated 1.7.2010, he was promoted to the post of
Upper Division Clerk. However, some complaints were made alleging
improper evaluation of the answersheets of candidates, who appeared in
the Limited Departmental Competitive Examination. The Head of the
Department took cognizance of the complaints and constituted a Board of
Enquiry to examine the allegations made therein. The Board, after making
enquiry, recommended for cancellation of the result and fresh evaluation of
the answersheets. Acting upon the recommendation of the Board, the result
was cancelled and fresh evaluation of the answersheets was made. And, in
the merit list prepared after fresh evaluation, the name of respondent did
not find place. The Department, therefore, vide order dated 25.1.2012
demoted him to the post of Lower Division Clerk from the Upper Division
Clerk. Admittedly, in the entire process of enquiry and before passing of
order dated 25.1.2012, the respondent was not given any opportunity of
hearing. Aggrieved, he challenged the order dated 25.1.2012 by filing OA
No.37/2012 before the Tribunal.
        The Tribunal, having regard to the fact that no opportunity of hearing
was given to the respondent before passing of order dated 25.1.2012,
allowed his OA No.37/2012 by the impugned order dated 23.8.2012 with a
direction against the petitioners to reinstate him on the post of Upper
Division Clerk. It is in this background, the petitioners have filed the present
petition for quashing of order dated 23.8.2012.
        After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we find no merit in
the present petition. As seen above, the respondent had appeared in the
Limited Departmental Competitive Examination and on the basis of his
position in the merit list, he was promoted vide order dated 1.7.2010 to the
post of Upper Division Clerk. The respondent even worked on the promoted
post for almost one year. Admittedly, the answersheet of the respondent
                                                                       Page 2 of 3

was re-valued behind his back, which led to preparation of fresh merit list.
The Board of Enquiry also did not give any opportunity of hearing to the
respondent before recommending re-evaluation of answersheets. And,
above all, even before passing of the order dated 25.1.2012 demoting the
respondent to the post of Lower Division Clerk, no show-cause notice was
issued to him. Apparently, the entire action of the petitioners against the
respondent has been in utter violation of the principles of natural justice.
And such an action cannot be allowed to sustain. We accordingly uphold the
finding of the Tribunal and dismiss the writ petition.
