CRL.REV.P. 543/2019 & Crl.M.A.9735/2019 (stay)
1.      Petitioner impugns order dated 08.03.2019, whereby, petitioner
has been directed to pay litigation expenses of Rs.11,000/- to the
respondent.
2.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is
CRL.REV.P.543/2019                                          Page 1 of 3

not doing any business and his business has been closed because of a
notification by the Government and he is surviving with the help of
other family members.
3.      Ex facie, I am not satisfied with the submission of learned
counsel for the petitioner.        Admittedly, the petitioner was a
businessman and running a business of sale of e-rickshaw.
4.      Reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner on a
Notification of the Government dated 14.08.2015 to contend that his
e-rickshaw business has been stopped.
5.      The Notification dated 14.08.2015 relied upon by learned
counsel for the petitioner merely states that the petitioner was running
an e-rickshaw business without obtaining a trade certificate. Petitioner
has been directed to obtain a trade certificate. The Notification does
not, in any manner, prevent the petitioner from doing the said business
or any other business.
6.      The petitioner is an able bodied person and as such the
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner is
not doing any work and is dependent on other family members, is not
believable.
7.      The Trial Court has merely directed the petitioner to deposit
litigation costs of Rs.11,000/-
CRL.REV.P.543/2019                                         Page 2 of 3

8.     I am not inclined to interfere with the said order directing the
petitioner to deposit litigation costs of Rs.11,000/-
9.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that after the
impugned order of 08.03.2019, no adverse orders have been passed by
the Trial Court closing his right to defend the proceedings or
proceeding ex-parte. This statement is taken on record.
10.    Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that petitioner
shall deposit 50% of the litigation expenses on the next date of
hearing before the Trial Court i.e. 10.05.2019 and the balance 50%
within one week thereafter.
11.    Petitioner is directed to pay 50% of the litigation expenses of
Rs. 11,000/- to the respondent on 10.05.2019 before the Trial Court
and the balance 50% within one week thereafter.
12.    It is clarified that in case adverse orders have been passed
against the petitioner after 08.03.2019 for non-compliance of the said
order, this order shall not in any manner affect the adverse order.
13.    Petition is dismissed with the aforesaid directions.
14.    Order Dasti under signatures of the Court Master.
