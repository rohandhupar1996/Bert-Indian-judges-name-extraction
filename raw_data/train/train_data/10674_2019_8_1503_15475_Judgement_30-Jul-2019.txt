G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                              2
     on account of insufficiency of funds.          The Complaint was lodged on
     04.11.2016.
     4.    With effect from 01.09.2018, Section 143A was inserted in the Act by
     Amendment Act 20 of 2018. Said Section is to the following effect:-
                “143A. Power to direct interim compensation. –
                (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
                of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), the Court
                trying an offence under section 138 may order the
                drawer of the cheque to pay interim compensation to
                the complainant –
                     (a) in a summary trial or a summons case, where
                         he pleads not guilty to the accusation made in
                         the complaint; and
                     (b) in any other case, upon framing of charge.
                (2) The interim compensation under sub-section (1)
                shall not exceed twenty per cent of the amount of the
                cheque.
                (3) The interim compensation shall be paid within
                sixty days from the date of the order under sub-
                section (1), or within such further period not
                exceeding thirty days as may be directed by the Court
                on sufficient cause being shown by the drawer of the
                cheque.
                (4) If the drawer of the cheque is acquitted, the Court
                shall direct the complainant to repay to the drawer the
                amount of interim compensation, with interest at the
                bank rate as published by the Reserve Bank of India,
                prevalent at the beginning of the relevant financial
                years, within sixty days from the date of the order, or
                within such further period not exceeding thirty days
                as may be directed by the Court on sufficient cause
                being shown by the complainant.

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                  3
                 (5) The interim compensation payable under this
                 section may be recovered as if it were a fine under
                 section 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
                 (2 of 1974).
                 (6) The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or
                 the amount of compensation awarded under section
                 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of
                 1974), shall be reduced by the amount paid or
                 recovered as interim compensation under this
                 section.”
     5.         Soon thereafter, the Trial Court ordered that 20% of the cheque
     amount be made over by the Appellant to the Respondent as interim
     compensation in accordance with the provisions of Section 143A of the
     Act. Thus, the Appellant was directed to pay to the Respondent a sum of
     Rs.7,00,000/-.
     6.       The Appellant being aggrieved, filed Criminal O.P.No.3406 of 2019
     in the High Court. By its order dated 08.02.2019, the High Court found no
     illegality or infirmity in the order awarding interim compensation under
     Section 143A of the Act but reduced the percentage from 20% of the
     cheque amount to 15% of the cheque amount.
     7.        The order of the High Court is presently under challenge. While
     issuing notice the Appellant was directed to deposit the sum so ordered by
     the High Court in the Trial Court. It was further directed that upon deposit,

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                  4
     the Trial Court should invest the money in Fixed Deposit and that the
     money would not be made over to the Respondent till further orders.
     Since the Respondent, despite having been served with the notice, had not
     entered appearance, this Court by its Order dated 01.07.2019 requested Mr.
     Vinay Navare, learned Senior Advocate to assist this Court as Amicus
     Curiae.
     8.           We heard Mr. G. Ananda Selvam, learned Advocate for the
     Appellant and the learned Amicus Curiae.
     9.      A reading of Section 143A shows (i) interim compensation must not
     exceed 20% of the amount of the cheque; (ii) it must be paid within the
     time stipulated under Sub-Section (3); (iii) if the accused is acquitted, the
     complainant shall be directed to pay to the accused the amount of interim
     compensation with interest at the bank rate; (iv) the interim compensation
     payable under said Section can be recovered as if it were a fine under
     Section 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘the Code’, for
     short); and (v) if the accused were to be convicted, the amount of fine to be
     imposed under Section 138 of the Act or the amount of compensation to be
     awarded under Section 357 of the Code would stand reduced by the amount
     paid or recovered as interim compensation.

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                               5
     10.      Since Sub-Section (5) of Section 143A stipulates that the interim
     compensation could be recovered as if it were a fine under Section 421 of
     the Code, said Section 421 also needs to be considered at this stage.
     Section 421 appears in Chapter XXXII of the Code which Chapter deals
     with ‘Execution, Suspension, Remission and Commutation of Sentences’.
     By very context and the language of the provisions contained in the
     Chapter, they apply in cases where the guilt of an accused is determined
     and he is convicted of an offence punishable with sentence and/or fine.
     Part-C of the Chapter deals with ‘Levy of Fine’ and Section 421 appearing
     in said Part-C is to the following effect:-
                 “421. Warrant for levy of fine.- (1) When an
                 offender has been sentenced to pay a fine, the Court
                 passing the sentence may take action for the recovery
                 of the fine in either or both of the following ways, that
                 is to say, it may –
                      (a) issue a warrant for the levy of the
                          amount by attachment and sale of any
                          movable property belonging to the
                          offender;
                      (b) issue a warrant to the Collector of the
                          district, authorising him to realise the
                          amount as arrears of land revenue from
                          the movable or immovable property, or
                          both, of the defaulter.
                 Provided that, if the sentence directs that in default of
                 payment of the fine, the offender shall be imprisoned,
                 and if such offender has undergone the whole of such
                 imprisonment in default, no Court shall issue such
                 warrant unless, for special reasons to be recorded in
                 writing, it considers it necessary so to do, or unless it

Criminal Appeal No. 1160 of 2019 @ SLP(Crl.)No.3342 of 2019
G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                6
                 has made an order for the payment of expenses or
                 compensation out of the fine under section 357.
                 (2) The State Government may make rules regulating
                 the manner in which warrants under clause (a) of sub-
                 section (1) are to be executed, and for the summary
                 determination of any claims made by any person other
                 than the offender in respect of any property attached
                 in execution of such warrant.
                 (3) Where the Court issues a warrant to the Collector
                 under clause (b) of sub-section (1), the Collector shall
                 realise the amount in accordance with the law relating
                 to recovery of arrears of land revenue, as if such
                 warrant were a certificate issued under such law:
                 Provided that no such warrant shall be executed by
                 the arrest or detention in prison of the offender.”
     11.      According to Section 421 of the Code, fine could be recovered
     either by warrant of attachment or sale of movable property belonging to
     the offender or by issuance of warrant to the Collector authorising him to
     realise the amount as arrears of land revenue from the movable or
     immovable property or both of the defaulter.
     12.      It is thus clear that in case an accused, against whom an order to
     pay interim compensation under Section 143A of the Act is passed, fails or
     is unable to pay the amount of interim compensation, the process under
     Section 421 can be taken resort to which may inter alia result in coercive
     action of recovery of the amount of interim compensation as if the amount
     represented the arrears of land revenue. The extent and rigor of the

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                   7
     procedure prescribed for such recovery may vary from State to State but
     invariably, such procedure may visit the person concerned with coercive
     methods.
     13.        For instance, by virtue of Section 183 of the Maharashtra Land
     Revenue Code, 1966, in case there be a default in payment of land revenue,
     the person concerned could be arrested and detained in custody for 10 days
     in the office of the Collector or of a Tehsildar unless the arrears of revenue
     which were due, were paid along with the penalty or interest and the cost of
     arrest and of the notice of demand as also the cost of his subsistence during
     detention.
     14.        In the present case, the Complaint was lodged in the year 2016
     that is to say, the act constituting an offence had occurred by 2016 whereas,
     the concerned provision viz. Section 143A of the Act was inserted in the
     statute book with effect from 01.09.2018.           The question that arises
     therefore is whether Section 143A of the Act is retrospective in operation
     and can be invoked in cases where the offences punishable under Section
     138 of the Act were committed much prior to the introduction of Section
     143A. We are concerned in the present case only with the issue regarding

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                    8
     applicability of said Section 143A to offences under Section 138 of the Act,
     committed before the insertion of said Section 143A.
     15.       While considering general principles concerning ‘retrospectivity
     of legislation’ in the context of Section 158-BE inserted in the Income Tax
     Act, 1961, it was observed by this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax
     (Central)-I, New Delhi vs. Vatika Township Private Limited1 as under:-
                    “28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to
                   be interpreted, one established rule is that unless a contrary
                   intention appears, a legislation is presumed not to be
                   intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea behind
                   the rule is that a current law should govern current
                   activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of
                   the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in
                   view the law of today and in force and not tomorrow’s
                   backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature of the
                   law is founded on the bedrock that every human being is
                   entitled to arrange his affairs by relying on the existing law
                   and should not find that his plans have been retrospectively
                   upset. This principle of law is known as lex prospicit non
                   respicit: law looks forward not backward. As was observed
                   in Phillips v. Eyre2, a retrospective legislation is contrary to
                   the general principle that legislation by which the conduct
                   of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for the first
                   time to deal with future acts ought not to change the
                   character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of
                   the then existing law.”
     16.       Similarly, while considering the effect of modified application of
     the provisions of the Code, as a result of Section 20(4)(bb) of the Terrorist
        1(2015)  1 SCC 1
        2 (1870)  LR 6 QB 1

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                    9
     and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, whereunder the period for
     filing challan or charge-sheet could get extended, this Court considered the
     issue about the retrospective operation of the concerned provisions in
     Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and others                 vs.   State of Maharashtra and
     others3 as under:-
                   “26. The Designated Court has held that the amendment
                   would operate retrospectively and would apply to the
                   pending cases in which investigation was not complete on
                   the date on which the Amendment Act came into force and
                   the challan had not till then been filed in the court. From
                   the law settled by this Court in various cases the illustrative
                   though not exhaustive principles which emerge with regard
                   to the ambit and scope of an Amending Act and its
                   retrospective operation may be culled out as follows:
                        (i) A statute which affects substantive rights is
                        presumed to be prospective in operation
                        unless made retrospective, either expressly or
                        by necessary intendment, whereas a statute
                        which merely affects procedure, unless such a
                        construction is textually impossible, is
                        presumed to be retrospective in its
                        application, should not be given an extended
                        meaning and should be strictly confined to its
                        clearly defined limits.
                        (ii) Law relating to forum and limitation is
                        procedural in nature, whereas law relating to
                        right of action and right of appeal even
                        though remedial is substantive in nature.
                        (iii) Every litigant has a vested right in
                        substantive law but no such right exists in
                        procedural law.

                     (iv) A procedural statute should not generally
                     speaking be applied retrospectively where the
                     result would be to create new disabilities or
                     obligations or to impose new duties in respect
                     of transactions already accomplished.
                     (v) A statute which not only changes the
                     procedure but also creates new rights and
                     liabilities shall be construed to be prospective
                     in operation, unless otherwise provided, either
                     expressly or by necessary implication.”
     17.       The fourth and the fifth principle as culled out by this Court in
     Hitendra Vishnu Thakur3are apposite to the present fact situation.
     18.       The provisions contained in Section 143A have two dimensions.
     First, the Section creates a liability in that an accused can be ordered to pay
     over upto 20% of the cheque amount to the complainant. Such an order can
     be passed while the complaint is not yet adjudicated upon and the guilt of
     the accused has not yet been determined. Secondly, it makes available the
     machinery for recovery, as if the interim compensation were arrears of land
     revenue. Thus, it not only creates a new disability or an obligation but also
     exposes the accused to coercive methods of recovery of such interim
     compensation through the machinery of the State as if the interim
     compensation represented arrears of land revenue. The coercive methods
     could also, as is evident from provision like Section 183 of the Maharashtra

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                  11
     Land Revenue Code, in some cases result in arrest and detention of the
     accused.
     19.       We must at this stage, refer to a decision of this Court in
     Employees’ State Insurance Corporation vs. Dwarka Nath Bhargwa4
     where provisions of Section 45B, which was inserted in Employees State
     Insurance Act, 1948 with effect from 28.01.1968 was held to be procedural
     and that it could have retrospective application. Said Section 45B is as
     under:-
                  “45B. Recovery of contributions. - Any contribution
                  payable under this Act may be recovered as an arrear of
                  land revenue.”
            The issue was whether the modality of recovery so prescribed in said
     Section 45B could be invoked in respect of amounts which had become
     payable on 27.01.1967 and 24.01.1968, i.e. before said Section 45B was
     inserted in the statute book.      While holding that the arrears could be
     recovered as arrears of land revenue, it was observed, “It is not in dispute
     and cannot be disputed that the contributions in question had remained
     payable all throughout and were not paid by the respondent.”
     20.       It must be stated that prior to the insertion of Section 143A in the
     Act there was no provision on the statute book whereunder even before the
        4 (1997) 7 SCC 131

Criminal Appeal No. 1160 of 2019 @ SLP(Crl.)No.3342 of 2019
G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                 12
     pronouncement of the guilt of an accused, or even before his conviction for
     the offence in question, he could be made to pay or deposit interim
     compensation.     The imposition and consequential recovery of fine or
     compensation either through the modality of Section 421 of the Code or
     Section 357 of the code could also arise only after the person was found
     guilty of an offence. That was the status of law which was sought to be
     changed by the introduction of Section 143A in the Act. It now imposes a
     liability that even before the pronouncement of his guilt or order of
     conviction, the accused may, with the aid of State machinery for recovery
     of the money as arrears of land revenue, be forced to pay interim
     compensation.      The person would, therefore, be subjected to a new
     disability or obligation. The situation is thus completely different from the
     one which arose for consideration in Employees’ State Insurance
     Corporation4 case.
     21.       Though arising in somewhat different context, proviso to Section
     142(b) which was inserted in the Act by Amendment Act 55 of 2002, under
     which cognizance could now be taken even in respect of a complaint filed
     beyond the period prescribed under Section 142(b) of the Act, was held to

G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                   13
     be prospective by this Court in Anil Kumar Goel v. Kishan Chand Kaura5.
     It was observed:-
                   “10. There is nothing in the amendment made to Section 142(b)
                   by Act 55 of 2002 that the same was intended to operate
                   retrospectively. In fact that was not even the stand of the
                   respondent. Obviously, when the complaint was filed on 28-11-
                   1998, the respondent could not have foreseen that in future any
                   amendment providing for extending the period of limitation on
                   sufficient cause being shown would be enacted.”
       22.      In our view, the applicability of Section 143A of the Act must,
       therefore, be held to be prospective in nature and confined to cases where
       offences were committed after the introduction of Section 143A, in order
       to force an accused to pay such interim compensation.
       23.      We must, however, advert to a decision of this Court in Surinder
       Singh Deswal and Ors. vs. Virender Gandhi6 where Section 148 of the
       Act which was also introduced by the same Amendment Act 20 of 2018
       from 01.09.2018 was held by this Court to be retrospective in operation.
       As against Section 143A of the Act which applies at the trial stage that is
       even before the pronouncement of guilt or order of conviction, Section
       148 of the Act applies at the appellate stage where the accused is already
       found guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the Act. It may be stated
       that there is no provision in Section 148 of the Act which is similar to
         5 (2007) 13 SCC 492
         6 (2019) 8 SCALE 445

Criminal Appeal No. 1160 of 2019 @ SLP(Crl.)No.3342 of 2019
G.J. Raja vs. Tejraj Surana
                                                                                   14
      Sub-Section (5) of Section 143A of the Act. However, as a matter of fact,
      no such provision akin to sub-section (5) of Section 143A was required as
      Sections 421 and 357 of the Code, which apply post-conviction, are
      adequate to take care of such requirements. In that sense said Section 148
      depends upon the existing machinery and principles already in existence
      and does not create any fresh disability of the nature similar to that created
      by Section 143A of the Act. Therefore, the decision of this Court in
      Surinder Singh Deswal5 stands on a different footing.
      24.     In the ultimate analysis, we hold Section 143A to be prospective
      in operation and that the provisions of said Section 143A can be applied or
      invoked only in cases where the offence under Section 138 of the Act was
      committed after the introduction of said Section 143A in the statute book.
      Consequently, the orders passed by the Trial Court as well as the High
      Court are required to be set aside. The money deposited by the Appellant,
      pursuant to the interim direction passed by this Court, shall be returned to
      the Appellant along with interest accrued thereon within two weeks from
      the date of this order.
      25.     The Appeal is allowed in aforesaid terms.
