                                                       PIL No. 27 of 2015
                                  BEFORE
            HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
11.07.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Mr.N Dhar, learned counsel for the petitioners.
        Mr.D Saikia, learned Senior Additional Advocate General, Assam
        for Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 and Mr. R Dubey, learned counsel for
        Respondent No.4.
        In the present Public Interest Litigation, case of petitioners is that
land situated at village Moina, under Mouja Mulibari, Porgonah Jafargarh,
was donated by a private person to the Government for Children Park,
but the same has been illegally encroached upon by respondent No. 4.
The petitioners have also stated that representation dated 18.2.2015
(Annexure-7) was made to the Deputy Commissioner, Karimganj for
taking action against the encroachment by respondent No. 4, but no
action has been taken till this date.
        Mr.D Saikia, learned Senior Additional Advocate General, Assam
states    that  Deputy   Commissioner,      Karimganj   has   removed      the
encroachment made by Respondent No.4 from the land which was
donated to the Government for Children Park. He also states that even
representation dated 18.2.2015 of the petitioners has been decided.
        As the purpose of this Public Interest Litigation has been served
with the removal of encroachment made by Respondent No.4, we find no
justification to proceed further with the same. We, however, wish to
observe that Deputy Commissioner shall ensure that henceforth no
encroachment on the land of Children Park shall be made by any person.
        With the above observation, the petition stands finally disposed
of.
              JUDGE                                  CHIEF JUSTICE
