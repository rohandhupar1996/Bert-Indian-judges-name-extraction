G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      The Appellant Oriental Insurance Company Limited impugns the award dated
        10.08.2010 in case of deceased Smt. Rama Sharma, who was aged about 50 years
        and five months on the date of accident which took place on 19.01.2009. The
        deceased had an income of ` 19,866/-.             A limited notice was issued to
        Respondents No.1 to 4 only on the aspect of deduction of income tax to arrive at
        the multiplicand.
2.      The deceased had an annual income of ` 19,866/- x 12 = ` 2,38,392/-. If there are
        no savings, the liability of the tax would be as under:-
        (1) Annual salary of the deceased                            =        ` 2,38,392/-
        (2) Exemption in case of woman                               =        ` 1,80,000/-
        (3) Taxable income                                           =        ` 58,392/-
        (4) Percentage of tax upto an income of ` 2.5 lacs           =        10%
        (5) The income tax payable (in case there are no savings)    =        ` 5,839/-
MAC APP 782/2010                                                               Page 1 of 2

3.      The Assessee is entitled to deduction of the savings under Section 80 C of the
        Income Tax Act.
4.      As per Sarla Verma & Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 (6) SCC
        121, it is settled that the annual income of the deceased would be “actual salary
        less tax.”
5.      The salary slip placed on record discloses that the amount of ` 1220/- was being
        deducted from the salary towards payment of GPF, State insurance and RPMF. If
        this amount is deducted from the taxable income, there would be liability of
        payment of income tax at the rate of ` 4375/- per annum only and the dependency
        would work out to be `          20,28,156/-.  The Tribunal awarded a sum of `
        20,66,064/- on account of loss of dependency. Since the tax was not being
        deducted at source by the Rajasthan Govt. deceased Smt. Rama Sharma’s
        employer, it can be assumed that there might have been other savings under
        Section 80C of the Income Tax Act and in that case there would not be any
        change in calculation of dependency. Even if, it is assumed that there was liability
        of income tax at the rate of ` 4357/- per annum, there was not much difference in
        the calculation of dependency.
6.      The compensation awarded by the Tribunal in my view is just and reasonable and
        does not call for any interference. The Appeal is accordingly dismissed and the
        award is confirmed. No costs.
                                                                          (G.P. MITTAL)
                                                                              JUDGE
