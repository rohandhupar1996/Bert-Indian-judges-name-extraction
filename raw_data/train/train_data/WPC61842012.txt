                              W.P.(C) No. 6184 of 2012
                                         BEFORE
                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
            Heard Ms. Dipika Borgohain, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Abani
    Deka, learned Standing Counsel, Education Department, Government of Assam for
    respondent Nos. 1 to 3 and Mr. Pallab Kataki, learned counsel for respondent No.5.
    2.      The matter relates to seniority dispute between the petitioner and the
    respondent No. 5. Both the petitioner and the respondent No. 5 were selected for
    the post of Headmaster, Madhabdev High School, Kachikota in the district of
    Lakhimpur, wherein the respondent No. 5 was placed at serial No. 1 and the
    petitioner at serial No. 2.
    3.      Pursuant to the order dated 10.03.2008 passed by this Court earlier in
    WP(C) No. 2790/2007 (Mrs. Dimbeswari Saikia -Vs- State of Assam & 3 Others) and
    the common order dated        02.08.2012 passed in WP(C) No. 3745/2008 (Mrs.
    Dimbeswari Saikia -Vs- State of Assam & 10 Others) and WP(C) No. 851/2012
    (Putul Ch. Saikia -Vs- State of Assam & 5 Others), the Director of Secondary
    Education, Assam determined the seniority of the respondent No. 5 above said Mrs.
    Dimbeswari Saikia (now retired) and the petitioner.
    4.      In WP(C) Nos. 3745/2008 and 851/2012, the challenge was with regard to
    the order dated 05.08.2008 passed by the Director of Secondary Education, Assam
    by which, he determined the seniority of the respondent No. 5 above said Mrs.
    Dimbeswari Saikia, an exercise that the DSE, Assam had carried out as per the
    direction dated 10.03.2008 that was issued by this Court earlier in WP(C) No. 2790/
    2008.
    5.      Pursuant to the common order dated 02.08.2012 passed in WP(C) Nos.
    3745/2008 and 851/2012, the DSE, Assam had taken up the exercise again for
    determining the seniority between the present petitioner and the respondent No. 5
    wherein the Director by his order dated 10.10.2012 determined the seniority of the
    WP(C) No. 6184 of 2012                                                 Page 1 of 7

respondent No. 5 above the petitioner. Hence, this writ petition challenging the said
order dated 10.10.2012 passed by the DSE, Assam.
6.      From the orders passed earlier by this court as well as the annexures
appended to the writ petition and the affidavits of the respondents, it transpires
that the petitioner with B.A. & B.T. degrees, pursuant to the decision of the
Managing Committee of Madhabdev High School, Kachikota, joined his service as
Assistant Teacher on 15.01.1981 after obtaining Graduation on 30.08.1982 and
when the said High School was provincialised w.e.f. 19.11.91, his date of joining
as Graduate Teacher was shown as 30.08.1982 and he was given the scale of pay
of Rs. 1375/- to 3375/- meant for graduate teachers in Secondary Schools.
7.      It is to be noted herein that when said Madhabdev High School was
provincialised with effect from 19.11.91, the petitioner was even allowed to draw
one advance increment as per ROP Rules, 1990 for his B.Ed. degree.
8.      Earlier, after the provincialisation on 19.11.1991, when one Assistant
Teacher, namely, Ms. Nivarani Dutta joined said Madhabdev High School, as some
differences between he, the School Managing Committee, the staff of the school
and its students cropped up, the School Managing Committee of Madhabdev High
School desired her transfer out of the said High School. Considering the same and
as the respondent No. 5, who was serving as an Assistant Teacher at Sankardev
Collegiate High School, Lakhimpur who was willing to join said Madhabdev High
School, Kachikota; the Inspector of Schools, Lakhimpur District Circle, North
Lakhimpur on 04.05.1994 passed an order of mutual transfer at their own request
transferring said Smti Nivarani Dutta, Assistant Teacher of Madhabdev High School
to Sankardev Collegiate High School vice respondent No. 5, Assistant Teacher of
Sankardev Collegiate High School transferred to Madhabdev High School, Kachikota
with their own pay, grade and service against each of them, in the interest of
public service, observing that no TA/DA will be admissible for their journey on
transfer. Accordingly, in pursuance of said transfer order dated 04.05.1994 of the
I.S., LDC, North Lakhimpur, the respondent No.5 joined said Madhabdev High
School, Kachikota on 14.05.1994.
WP(C) No. 6184 of 2012                                                  Page 2 of 7

9.        The contention of the petitioner herein is that since the respondent No. 5
was transferred mutually on her own request with said Smti. Nivarani Dutta
pursuant to the order dated 04.05.1994 of the I.S., North Lakhimpur and joined
said Madhabdev High School on 14.05.1994, she is junior to him in the said school.
10.       The respondent No. 5 filed her affidavit in the matter on 29.05.2014 and
contended that she joined the Madhabdev High School, Kachikota in the year 1994
pursuant to the order of the I.S., North Lakhimpur dated 04.05.1994 but denied
that she was transferred to Madhabdev High School at her own request due to
mutual transfer with said Smti. Nivarani Dutta. Said respondent No. 5 submitted
that on 10.03.1994, the Managing Committee of Madhabdev High School took a
resolution that she should be brought to that school in place of said Smti. Nivarani
Dutta, who should be transferred out from the said school and the said resolution
dated 10.03.1994 of the Managing Committee of the School was forwarded to the
I.S., LDC, North Lakhimpur on 11.03.1994 itself. But as the said Inspector did not
take any step in that regard, on public pressure, on 20.03.1994 the then President
of the political party of Congress (I) Committee, Bihpuria wrote to the said
Inspector, North Lakhimpur to take necessary steps to make such transfer as
resolved by the Managing Committee of said Madhabdev High School. Therefore,
the respondent No. 5 submits that for the interest of public service and betterment
of the academic atmosphere of said Madhabdev High School, the Inspector of
Schools, LDC, North Lakhimpur by his order dated 04.05.1994 transferred her from
Sankardev Collegiate High School to Madhabdev High School and in her place
transferred said Smti. Nivarani Dutta from Madhabdev High School to Sankardev
Collegiate High School. Said respondent No.5 in her affidavit also stated that
initially she joined the Sankardev Collegiate High School on 01.01.1981 pursuant to
a decision of the Managing Committee of Sankardev Collegiate High School dated
28.12.1980 and that the said school was provincialised w.e.f. 19.11.1991, whereas
the petitioner joined the Madhabdev High School as Graduate Teacher only w.e.f.
30.08.1982. The respondent No. 5 also submitted that her service was confirmed
by order dated 21.01.2011 and that by order dated 19.03.2012 she was posted as
Headmistress of said Madhabdev High School and stated that since then she
serving in the said post till date.
WP(C) No. 6184 of 2012                                                   Page 3 of 7

11.     The Director of Secondary Education, Assam also filed an affidavit in the
matter and stated that the respondent No. 5 was posted as Headmistress of
Madhabdev High School as she was regularly selected for the said post as per the
selection held in January, 2011. The Director also submitted that earlier on
05.08.2008, the Director of Secondary Education determined the seniority of the
respondent No. 5 above Smt. Dimbeswari Saikia, who was senior to the present
petitioner. The official respondents further stated that the respondent No. 5 is
senior to the petitioner as her date of birth is 29.02.1959 whereas petitioner’s date
of birth is 01.05.1959 and that as by order dated 04.05.1994, the I.S., LDC, North
Lakhimpur, in the interest of public service, transferred the respondent No. 5 from
Sankardev Collegiate High School to said Madhabdev High School, therefore, her
seniority in Madhabdev High School will remain intact and that she cannot be
placed as junior to the petitioner and substantiated the impugned order dated
10.10.2012 passed by the Director of Secondary Education, Assam.
12.     It is seen that this Court by its order dated 18.03.2008 passed earlier in
WP(C) No. 2790/2007 (Mrs. Dimbeswari Saikia -Vs- State of Assam & 3 Others)
have set aside the order dated 18.04.2007 of the Director of Secondary Education,
Assam by which the Director had determined the seniority of the respondent No. 5
above the said petitioner Smti. Dimbeswari Saikia considering that said respondent
No. 5 joined as Graduate Teacher on 01.02.1982 whereas Smti Dimbeswari Saikia
joined as Graduate Teacher 02.06.1982 and the present petitioner joined as
Graduate Teacher       on 30.08.1982 and that the said respondent No. 5 was
transferred by the Inspector of Schools, LDC, North Lakhimpur by order dated
04.05.1994 in the interest of public service. The Court in the said order dated
18.03.2008 passed in WP(C) No. 2790/2007 have observed as follows:
                “In the backdrop of the reasons assigned in the order dated
        18.4.2007 for treating the respondent No.4 (the respondent No.5 in the
        present petition) as senior to the petitioner when one considers the order
        dated 4.5.2004 whereby respondent No.4 was transferred to Madhabdev
        High School, what attracts the attention is that the order dated 4.5.2004
        speaks that the transfer in question was a result of mutual requests made by
        respondent No.4 and one Smt. Nivarani Dutta. In such circumstances, the
        respondent No.4 should ordinarily be treated as junior to those teachers who
        were at the relevant point of time serving as Assistant Teachers in
        Madhabdev High School. Viewed thus, it is clear that unless, otherwise,
        permitted by law, the petitioner would be regarded as senior to the
WP(C) No. 6184 of 2012                                                   Page 4 of 7

       respondent No.4 in the post of Assistant Teacher, Madhabdev High School.
       Though the order of transfer dated 04.05.2004 speaks that the transfer has
       been made in public interest, the fact remains that when the transfer had
       been ordered due to request made by the respondent No.4 it is logically
       follows that unless some materials are brought on record to show otherwise,
       the order of transfer dated 4.5.2004 would have to be treated as an order of
       transfer made on mutual request of the parties concerned. The order dated
       18.4.2007 whereby inter-se seniority between the petitioner and the
       respondent No.4 has been fixed gives no explanation that the respondent
       No.3 had taken into account the fact that the transfer in question took place
       according to order dated 05.04.2004 on the request made by the respondent
       No.4. An administrative order must reflect that while passing the order the
       authority concerned has taken into account all such facts which are relevant
       and aschewed from considering all such facts which are irrelevant. In the
       present case, the respondent no.4 appears to have not taken into
       consideration that the said order of transfer reflects that transfer has been
       made on then mutual request of the parties concerned. Thus, while
       determining the inter-se seniority, the respondent No.3 has not taken into
       account the relevant factor. Such an order is ex-facie illegal for the order
       suffers from non-application of mind.
               Coupled with the above, it is also worth noticing that the
       determination of question of seniority was obviously going to adversely affect
       either the petitioner or the respondent No.4. No order as regards their
       seniority in the facts and circumstances of the present case could have been
       made without giving both of them any opportunity of having their say in the
       matter. Looked at from this angle order also, the impugned order dated
       18.04.2007 whereby the respondent No.4 has been treated as senior to the
       petitioner cannot be sustained.”
13.    The said observation of the Court made on 18.03.2008 in said WP(C) No.
2790/2007 has attained finality by efflux of time as neither the Education
Department nor the said respondent No. 4 (respondent No. 5,herein) challenged
the same before any higher forum. Further, by the said order dated 18.03.2008
passed in WP(C) No. 2790/2007 the order of the Director of Secondary Education,
Assam dated 18.04.2007 was set aside and quashed, directing the said Director to
determine the seniority between the petitioner of the said writ petition and the
respondent No. 5 herein afresh, pursuant to which the DSE, Assam again passed an
order on 05.08.2008 determining the seniority of respondent No. 5 above the
present petitioner as well as that of Smti. Dimbeswari Saikia, which was again set
aside and quashed by this court by a common order dated 02.08.2012 passed in
WP(C) Nos. 3745/2008 and 851/2012 pursuant to which the Director of Secondary
Education, Assam passed the impugned order dated 10.10.2012.
WP(C) No. 6184 of 2012                                                  Page 5 of 7

14.     Though the DSE, Assam by the impugned order dated 10.10.2012
determined the seniority of the respondent No. 5 above the petitioner stating that
her transfer order dated 04.05.1994 of the I.S., LDC, North Lakhimpur was issued
in the interest of public service, but he failed to consider the fact that the
respondent No. 5 admitted during the enquiry that she wrote a letter on
27.02.1994 expressing her desire to get transferred out of Sankardev Collegiate
High School by means of mutual understanding with the Assistant Teacher Smti.
Nivarani Dutta of Madhabdev High School. The respondent No. 5 in her affidavit did
not state anything nor denied regarding her such submission of transfer at her own
request by mutual understanding with Smti. Nivarani Dutta of Madhabdev High
School, except making a statement that her seniority has already been determined
way back on 18.04.2007, which is incorrect as this Court by order dated 18.03.2008
passed in WP(C) No. 2790/2007 have set aside the said order dated 18.04.2007 of
the Director of Secondary Education, Assam determining her seniority above said
Smti. Dimbeswari Saikia and the present petitioner. It is also seen from the
impugned order dated 10.10.2012 that the DSE, Assam while determining the
seniority of the respondent No. 5 and the petitioner did not consider the fact that
the petitioner from the date of provincialization i.e. 19.11.1991 was allowed to
draw an advance increment as per the ROP Rules, 1990 for his B.Ed. degree and,
as   such, was receiving higher scale of pay than the respondent No. 5 w.e.f.
19.11.1991 the date from which services of both the petitioner in Madhabdev High
School and the respondent No. 5 in Sankardev Collegiate High School was
provincialised. Further, the Director also did not consider the observation made by
this Court earlier in the judgment and order dated 18.03.2008 passed in WP(C) No.
2790/2007, where the Court specifically observed that “unless some materials are
brought on record to show otherwise by the respondent No. 5, the order of transfer
dated 4.5.2004 would have to be treated as an order of transfer made on mutual
request of the parties concerned.”
15.     The order dated 04.05.1994 of the Inspector of Schools, LDC, North
Lakhimpur clearly reflects that the said transfer order was issued on mutual
transfer on the own request of the respondent No. 5 and the said Smti. Nivarani
Dutta.
WP(C) No. 6184 of 2012                                                  Page 6 of 7

16.     As the Director of Secondary Education, Assam failed to consider all these
aspects while determining the seniority between the respondent No. 5 and the
petitioner by the impugned order dated 10.10.2012, the same being bad in law, is
hereby quashed and the said Director is directed again to re-determine the
seniority of the petitioner and the respondent No. 5 in terms of the judgment and
order of this Court dated 18.03.2008 passed in WP(C) No. 2790/2007 as well as the
common order dated 02.08.2012 passed in WP(C) Nos. 3745/2008 and 851/2012
after giving an opportunity of hearing to both the petitioner and the respondent No.
5 and on perusal of the original records pertaining to the transfer order under
Memo No. PROV/AT/2/A/92-93/29668-72 dated 04.05.1994 of Inspector of
Schools, LDC, North Lakhimpur as well as the original proceedings book with regard
to transfer of said Smti. Nivarani Dutta, Assistant Teacher of Madhabdev High
School as well as that of respondent No.5, the then Assistant Teacher of Sankardev
Collegiate High School.
17.     The petitioner shall submit the certified copy of this order before the
Director of Secondary Education, Assam along with a fresh representation and shall
obtain necessary receipt and within a period of three months from the date of
receipt of such representation from the petitioner, the Director of Secondary
Education, Assam shall re-determine the seniority between the petitioner and the
respondent No. 5 as directed above.
18.     With the aforesaid observation and direction, this writ petition stands
disposed of.
                                                                JUDGE
