                                 Jugal Kishore Dalmia
                                         BEFORE
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE HITESH KUMAR SARMA
        Advocate for the Appellant            : Mr. D Talukdar.
        Advocate for the Respondent           : Mr. K K Phukan & Mr. P Gogoi.
        Date of hearing & Judgment            : 20.07.2017
                         JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)
               This is an appeal, against the judgment and order dated 22.7.2005,
        passed in CR Case No. 534/2004, acquitting the accused respondent No. 2 of
        the charge under Section 392 IPC.
        2)     The case of the appellant, who was the complainant in the aforesaid CR
        Case before the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhemaji, is that, he
        purchased a Maruti Van, bearing Registration No. AS-22/4704, on 30.7.2003, in
        the name of his wife Smt. Beena Das from the accused respondent No. 2 at a
        consideration of Rs. 1,61,000/-, and towards the satisfaction of the consideration
                                                                                Page 1 of 6
Crl.A.182/2005

        amount, Rs. 1,45,000/- , as agreed, was paid instantly and Rs. 16,000/- was
        agreed to be paid and received by the parties on 6.5.2004. The complainant
        appellant visited the residence of the accused respondent for making the
        payment of balance amount of Rs. 16,000/-, but could not be paid as he was not
        found available     in the residence.    On 23.6.2004, while the complainant
        appellant with his family members were proceeding to Silapathar in the said
        vehicle, they were intercepted at Silapathar Forest Gate by the accused
        respondent and taken away the vehicle from his possession after putting him
        under threat and even assaulting him.
        3)      On receipt of the complaint, the learned trial court proceeded as per
        procedure prescribed by law, and ultimately, took cognizance of an offence
        under Section 392 IPC against the accused respondent. A charge under Section
        392 IPC was framed against the accused respondent in due course.
        4)      After completion of trial, the learned Additional Chief Judicial
        Magistrate, vide his judgment aforesaid, acquitted the accused of the offence
        under Section 392 IPC.
        5)      This appeal is against an order of acquittal. It is a settled law that unless
        there is apparent perversity in the judgment of a trial court, there should not be
        any interference of the same in the appeal.
        6)      Therefore, such settled position of law necessitates this court to look into
        the evidence on record and the judgment passed by the learned trial court to
        find out whether there is any perversity in the decision of the learned trial court
        which, otherwise, would have resulted in a decision different to the one
        recorded by the learned trial court.
                                                                                  Page 2 of 6
Crl.A.182/2005

        7)      I have perused the record of the learned trial court and evidence of the
        witnesses. I have also meticulously examined the impugned judgment.
        8)      From the evidence of PW1 and PW2, who are the eyewitnesses of the
        alleged occurrence of taking away of vehicle from the possession of the
        complainant appellant, it is clear that they were also travelling in the said Maruti
        Van at the relevant point of time and the accused respondent along with two
        others, restrained them at Silapathar Forest Gate, and also asked the complainant
        appellant to hand over the key of the vehicle to him. The two boys supporting
        the accused respondent, were armed with iron rod, threatened the complainant
        appellant and one of them even assaulted him with a fist blow. Then, out of
        fear, complainant appellant handed over the key of the vehicle and the accused
        respondent and his companion fled away from the place of occurrence
        thereafter. The evidence on record and the judgment, read together, makes it
        appear that there was some improvement in the evidence of PW1 and PW2, so
        far assault on the complainant appellant is concerned at the relevant time of
        occurrence, as their such evidence is found inconsistent with the initial statements
        recorded by the court before asking cognizance.
        9)      It has come out from the evidence on record that, vide Ext.1, the
        aforesaid vehicle was purchased by the complainant appellant from the accused
        respondent in the name of his wife. On scrutiny of the evidence on record as a
        whole, it does not appear that there is any dispute raised on Ext.1, meaning
        thereby, the execution of the Ext.1 is never in question during the trial of the
        case.
                                                                                  Page 3 of 6
Crl.A.182/2005

        10)     In Paragraph-22 of the judgment, the learned trial court has recorded
        that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 lent support to the Ext.1. The Paragraph-22
        of the judgment is quoted below :
                          “The evidence of PW1 and PW2 also reveals that PW2 has
                purchased the said vehicle on 30.7.2003 from the accused vide Exhhibit
                (1), fixing the price of the vehicle at Rs. 1,61,000/- she has paid a sum of
                Rs. 1,45,000/- to the accused and agreed to pay the remaining sum on
                6.5.2004, but she could not pay the sum of that day as the accused is
                found absent in his house. The accused has handed over the vehicle
                alongwith the documents then and there. Their evidence also reveals
                that from 30.7.2003 to 23.6.2004 the vehicle was in their possession.
                PW3 is the attesting witness and PW4 is the author of exhibit (1) and to
                some extent they also leads support to the version PW1 and 2 in this
                regard. Now it is to be seen how far the witnesses of the complainant
                are reliable.”
        11)     Thereafter, the learned trial court, while recording that the PW1 and
        PW2 have improved their version at different stage of the case, but on the core
        point of taking of the vehicle by the accused respondent, no dispute has been
        recorded. To arrive at the truth to a particular fact, it is the responsibility of the
        court to segregate the evidence that can be relied upon from the evidence which
        is untrustworthy. There is no such definite principle of appreciation of evidence.
        There is no reason for the court for not believing the evidence of PW1 and PW2
        which is consistent and corroborative on facts.                Some deviations or
        improvements in the evidence before the court from the statements under
                                                                                   Page 4 of 6
Crl.A.182/2005

        Section 200 or 202 Cr.PC is found in the evidence on oath before the trial court
        do not necessarily falsify the prosecution version as a whole.
        12)     Whatever it may be, it appears from the evidence on record taken
        together with the appreciation of evidence recorded by the learned trial court in
        Paragraph-22 & 23, it does not appear that there was correct appreciation of the
        evidence on record. Had the evidence, on record, been correctly appreciated,
        perhaps, the decision would have been otherwise than the one recorded by the
        learned trial court. That apart, in Paragraph-25 of the judgment, the learned
        trial court recorded that the vehicle was handed over to the complainant
        appellant and that only the Registration Certificate was handed over and the
        Insurance Policy was supposed to be handed over on 6.5.2004 on payment of
        the remaining amount of Rs. 16,000/-. But the fact remains that the learned trial
        court has accepted the evidence of taking away of the vehicle from the
        possession of the complainant appellant midway while he was proceeding to
        Silapathar, which speaks volumes about handing over of the vehicle to the
        complainant appellant.
        13)     The position appearing from the evidence on record, as indicated above,
        and the conflicting appreciation and the evidence of the witnesses in Paragraph-
        22, 23 & 25 of the judgment, leaves this court with no doubt that a detail
        evaluation of the evidence on the record is necessary so as to avoid any
        perversity in the findings recorded by the learned trial court.
        14)     That being so, the judgment dated 22.7.2005, passed in CR Case No.
        534/2004, by the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dhemaji, is set
        aside and remanded back with a direction to proceed with the case from the
        stage of argument and to deliver a fresh judgment.
                                                                              Page 5 of 6
Crl.A.182/2005

        15)    It is made clear that the learned court, without being influenced by the
        observation made by this court, is at liberty to pass any free and independent
        judgment.
        16)    Both the parties are directed to appear before the learned trial court on
        17.8.2017.
        17)    Accordingly, the appeal is party allowed.
        18)    Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment.
                                                                               JUDGE
