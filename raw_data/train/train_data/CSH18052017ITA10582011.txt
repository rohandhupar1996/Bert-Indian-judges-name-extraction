          %                            18.05.2017
Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
1. These are three appeals by the Revenue under Section 260A of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 („Act‟) against the common order dated 5th October,
2010 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal („ITAT‟) in ITA Nos.
1410, 1411 and 1413/Del/2007 relating to Assessment Years („AYs‟) 1998-
1999, 1999-2000 and 2001-2002.
2. It must be mentioned at the outset that at the time of admission of these
appeals, on 23rd March, 2012, there were 7, 4 and 6 questions of law framed
in ITA Nos. 1058, 1061 and 1063 of 2011 respectively. In each of the said
appeals, the first question framed reads as under:
         “(1) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, ITAT was
         right in law in holding that assumption of jurisdiction under section
         148 of the Income tax Act, 1961 was not valid?”
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                                  Page 2 of 11

3. The other questions pertain inter alia to the treatment of payments
received by the Assessee from the operation and maintenance of power plant
projects i.e. whether these receipts were taxable either as business income or
as fee for technical services (FTS). In these three appeals, however, the
Court proposes to confine its examination to the first question viz., the
validity of the assumption of jurisdiction under Section 148 of the Act.
4. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, the Court is satisfied that the
said question has, for reasons to follow, to be answered in favour of the
Assessee. Resultantly all consequential assessment orders are rendered
invalid thus obviating the need to examine the other questions that pertain to
the additions made under the consequential assessment orders. The Court
however clarifies that the other questions framed in these appeals, and which
arise in certain other connected appeals of the Revenue against the Assessee
for other AYs are left open to be decided in the other appeals.
5. The Assessee, a company incorporated under the laws of the United
Kingdom (U.K.), during the AYs in question, was engaged, inter alia, in the
business         of      erection,       commissioning, supervision, operation       and
maintenance of power plants. The business activities in India were carried
out by the Assessee through various projects, offices, located in India.
These, according to the Revenue constituted the Assessee's permanent
establishment in India under Article 5 of the Double Taxation Avoidance
Agreement (DTAA) between India and U.K.
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                                Page 3 of 11

6. The Assessee's returns for the three AYs in question i.e., AYs 1998-99,
1999-2000 and 2001-2002 were picked up for scrutiny and the assessments
were completed by the Assessing Officer (AO) by passing assessment orders
under Section 143(3) of the Act. Placed before the Court are copies of the
questionnaires issued by the AO for the relevant AYs and the replies thereto
filed by the Assessee. These questionnaires refer to the nature of the
transactions and the payments received in relation thereto.
7. For the Financial Year 2004-2005 , the Assessee filed applications dated
25th June, 2004 and 27th May, 2004 under Section 195(3) of the Act for
issuance of nil deduction of Tax Deducted at Source („TDS‟). The Assistant
Director of Income-Tax („ADIT‟) Circle-II (1), International Transactions,
by an order dated 20th July, 2004 declined the application. He, inter alia,
proposed to initiate reassessment/revision proceedings under Sections
147/263 in respect of the earlier orders to bring the correct income to tax in
accordance with law. The plea taken in this order was that payments
received by the Assesse, pursuant to the Operations and Maintenance
(O&M) Agreements should be treated as fees for technical services („FTS‟)
within the meaning of Explanation 2 to Section 9(1)(vii) of the Act and
Article 13(4) (c) of the DTAA between India and U.K.
8. Aggrieved by the above order, the Petitioner applied to the Director of
Income Tax („DIT‟) under Section 264 of the Act. By an order dated 20th
December, 2004, the DIT set aside the order of the ADIT, holding that the
“Assesse here is neither making available technical knowledge, experience
nor is developing and transferring technical plan or design.” He concluded
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                          Page 4 of 11

that the services rendered under the O&M Agreements "cannot be
considered as ancillary or subsidiary to the enjoyment of any right
prescribed as „royalty‟." Further, “under Article 13 therefore the fee for
technical services does not fit into the nature of receipt the assessee is
having.”
9. Notwithstanding the above orders, the AO proceeded to reopen the
assessments under Section 147 read with 148 of the Act for the three AYs in
question, i.e., 1998-1999, 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. The reasons therefor
were issued by the AO on 28th March 2005. It was noted inter alia by him
therein that in the original assessment orders under Section 143(3) of the Act
“no opinion with regard to taxation of these technical services has been
formed by the then AO.” It was further stated that “the facts relating to the
nature of income being fees for technical services have never been brought
to the notice of the AO.”
10. The Assessee objected to the reopening inter alia on the ground that it
was based on mere „change of opinion‟. Its objections were rejected by an
order dated 9th September, 2005.
11. The reassessments were completed by treating the payments as FTS. The
Assessee then carried the matter by way of appeals to the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)]. By a common order dated 29th December,
2006 passed in the appeals pertaining to the three AYs in question, the
CIT(A), relying on the decision of the Division Bench („DB‟) of this Court
in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of
Income-Tax, [2006] 281 ITR 394(Del), came to the conclusion that since
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                         Page 5 of 11

the original assessment orders were silent on the aspect of treating the
payments received by the Assessee as FTS, the jurisdictional pre-condition
for attracting Section 147 stood fulfilled.
12. Aggrieved by the above order, the Assessee went before the ITAT. In
the impugned order, the ITAT noted that while for AYs 1998-1999 and
1999-2000 the notices under Section 148 of the Act were issued after four
years, the notice for the AY 2001-2002 had been issued within four years.
The ITAT referred to the decision of the Full Bench („FB‟) of this Court in
CIT v. Kelvinator of India Ltd. (2002) 256 ITR 1 (Del). It also noted the
decision of this Court in CIT vs. Eicher Ltd. (2007) 294 ITR 310(Del)
where it was held that if the entire material had been placed by the Assessee
before the AO at the time when the original assessment was made and the
AO had applied his mind to material and accepted the view of the Assessee,
then the assessment cannot be reopened merely on the basis of change of
opinion.
13. The ITAT examined the assessment orders, queries raised by the AO and
the other material on record and concluded that the Assessee had duly
disclosed the very nature of its activities. As regards the observation of the
AO that the Assessee should have filed the accounts of each project
individually, instead of filing the consolidated statement of accounts, the
ITAT noted that the Assesse had been filing audited accounts. It opined that
“it was the duty of the AO to have examined this aspect in the scrutiny
assessment.” Further, the AO had called for information in that regard and
the Assessee had submitted an explanation on its activities. The ITAT,
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                         Page 6 of 11

therefore, held that it was "a different perception of the new incumbent on
the same details." Thus, the assessment has been reopened by the AO "only
on the basis of the change of opinion". Further, the ITAT noted that for the
AYs 1998-1999 and 1999-2000, the AO was unable to point out which
material facts had not been disclosed by the Assessee. The Assessee‟s
appeals were allowed and the reassessment orders set aside.
14. This Court has heard the submissions of both Mr. Rahul Kaushik,
learned Senior Standing Counsel for the Revenue and Mr. M.S. Syali,
learned Senior Counsel for the Assessee. The Court has also perused the
notices/questionnaires issued by the AO in the course of the assessment
proceedings and the replies thereto by the Assessee. The Court has also
perused the original assessment orders passed under Section 143(3) of the
Act and the reasons for the reopening of the assessments.
15. The main plank of the submission of the Revenue before the CIT(A),
which has been adverted to by the ITAT in the impugned order, is the
decision of the DB of this Court in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd. v.
Assistant Commissioner of Income-Tax (supra). In particular, reliance is
placed on the following observations:
         “19.....The argument that the proposed reopening of assessment was
         based only upon a change of opinion has not impressed us. The
         assessment order did not admittedly address itself to the question
         which the assessing officer proposes to examine in the course of re-
         assessment proceedings. The submission of Mr. Vohra that even when
         the order of assessment did not record any explicit opinion on the
         aspects now sought to be examined, it must be presumed that those
         aspects were present to the mind of the assessing officer and had been
         held in favour of the assessee is too farfetched a proposition to merit
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                           Page 7 of 11

         acceptance. There may indeed be a presumption that the assessment
         proceedings have been regularly conducted, but there can be no
         presumption that even when the order of assessment is silent, all
         possible angles and aspects of a controversy had been examined and
         determined by the assessing officer. It is trite that a matter in issue can
         be validly determined only upon application of mind by the authority
         determining the same. Application of mind is, in turn, best
         demonstrated by disclosure of mind, which is best done by giving
         reasons for the view which the authority is taking. In cases where the
         order passed by a statutory authority is silent as to the reasons for the
         conclusion it has drawn, it can well be said that the authority has not
         applied its mind to the issue before it nor formed any opinion. The
         principle that a mere change of opinion cannot be a basis for
         reopening computed assessments would be applicable only to
         situations where the assessing officer has applied his mind and taken a
         conscious decision on a particular matter in issue. It will have no
         application where the order of assessment does not address itself to
         the aspect which is the basis for reopening of the assessment, as is the
         position in the present case. It is in that view inconsequential whether
         or not the material necessary for taking a decision was available to the
         assessing officer either generally or in the form of a reply to the
         questionnaire served upon the assessed. What is important is whether
         the assessing officer had based on the material available to him taken
         a view. If he had not done so, the proposed reopening cannot be
         assailed on the ground that the same is based only on a change of
         opinion.”
16. The fact of the matter is that later Benches of this Court, including two
Full Benches in CIT v. Kelvinator of India Ltd.(supra) and CIT v. Usha
International Ltd., (2012) 348 ITR 485 have disagreed with the view
expressed by the DB in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd. v. Assistant
Commissioner of Income-Tax(supra). In fact, the decision of the FB in CIT
v. Kelvinator of India Ltd.(supra) was affirmed by the Supreme Court in
CIT v. Kelvinator of India Ltd. [2010] 320 ITR 561 (SC).
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                              Page 8 of 11

17. The Full Bench of this Court in CIT v. Usha International Ltd.(supra),
specifically overruled the decision of the DB in Consolidated Photo and
Finvest Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Income-Tax(supra). Even prior
thereto, in KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. ADIT [2007] 292 ITR 49, another
DB of this Court noticed the anomaly that had resulted from the decision in
Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of
Income-Tax (supra), which was contrary to other decisions, including the
decision of the FB in CIT v. Kelvinator of India Ltd.(supra). This was
noticed by the DB in KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. ADIT (supra) where it
observed:
         “16. The Full Bench of this Court in Commissioner of Income-Tax v.
         Kelvinator of India Ltd. [2002] 256 ITR 1 had opined that the
         amendments introduced into Section 147 with effect from 1.4.1989
         have not altered the position that a mere change of opinion of the AO
         was not sufficient ground for embarking on a reassessment. Calcutta
         Discount was duly considered and applied by the Full Bench. The Full
         Bench further observed that an order of assessment must be presumed
         to have been passed by the AO concerned after due and proper
         application of mind. In these circumstances the decision of the
         Division Bench in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd. v. Assistant
         Commissioner of Income-Tax , inasmuch as it is irreconcilable with
         the views of the Full Bench, must be held not to lay down the correct
         law. This is especially so since the assessment proceedings had not
         come to an end under the first sub-section of Section 143, but under
         the third Sub-section. A Division Bench of a particular High Court is
         fully bound by the view preferred by a larger Bench of that Court,
         regardless of the fact that another High Court prefers a different view
         in this case that of the Gujarat High Court as in Gruh Finance Ltd. v.
         Joint Commissioner of Income-Tax (Assessment) , Praful Chunilal
         Patel v. M.J. Makwana, Assistant CIT and Garden Silk Mills Ltd. v.
         Deputy CIT (No. 1). The Full Bench of this Court has taken into
         consideration both Praful Chunilal Patel as well as Garden Silk Mills.
         In Kelvinator the Full Bench had also analysed the earlier Division
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                           Page 9 of 11

         Bench decisions, namely, Jindal Photo Films Ltd. v. Deputy
         Commissioner of Income-Tax presided over by R.C. Lahoti J. (as
         learned Chief Justice of India then was) and Bawa Abhai Singh v.
         Deputy Commissioner of Income-Tax [2002] 253 ITR 83 comprising
         Arijit Pasayat and D.K. Jain JJ. (as their Lordships then were). It is
         quite possible that had the Court in Consolidated Photo been made
         aware of the consistent opinion of this Court in Jindal Photo and
         Bawa Abhai Singh, their conclusion may have been totally different,
         notwithstanding alternative view of the Gujarat High Court.”
18. There is no manner of doubt that the decision of the DB of this Court in
Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of
Income-Tax(supra) is no longer good law. The main plank of the Revenue's
case before this Court, therefore, fails. Nevertheless, the Court proceeds to
examine the question of validity of the reopening of the assessments for the
AYs in question.
19. The fact of the matter is that during the course of the original
assessments under Section 143 (3), the AO did serve upon the Assessee a
detailed questionnaire. The AO examined the nature of the transactions
involving the Assessee and the payments received therefor. The reopening
was not based on any fresh material. By revisiting the same materials the
successor AO now concluded that the payments received by the Assessee
pursuant to the O&M Agreements should be treated as FTS. In the
circumstances, the view taken by a successor AO on the same material was
indeed nothing but a mere change of opinion. It is a well-settled legal
proposition, as explained in Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd. v. ITO [1961] 41
ITR 191(SC) that once an Assessee has discharged the burden of not only
producing the account books and other documents, but also the specific
ITA Nos.1058/2011, 1061/2011 & 1063/2011                          Page 10 of 11

material relevant to the assessment, "it is for the Income-tax Officer to draw
the proper inferences of fact and law therefrom and the Assessee cannot
further be called upon to do so for him."      In Indian Oil Corporation v.
ITO [1986] 159 ITR 956. the Court pertinently observed "it is for the taxing
authority to draw inference. It is not necessary for the Assessee to draw
inference.” These observations apply on all fours to the case on hand. Here
the Assessee had discharged its burden of disclosing fully and truly all the
material facts before the AO during the original assessments. There was no
basis for the successor AO to conclude that "no opinion with regard to
taxation" of the payments received for the services rendered had been
formed by the AO. It is plain that the pre-condition for invoking Section 147
did not exist. The assumption of jurisdiction under Section 148 of the Act
was not valid.
20. Consequently, the question framed by this Court on the above aspect is
answered in the affirmative, i.e., in favor of the Assesse and against the
Revenue. The appeals are dismissed, but with no order as to costs.
