Reason:
                                                                     1

Revenue    (Commissioner     of  Wealth   Tax)  under
Section   27-A    of  the   Wealth   Tax   Act,  1957
(hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) and set aside
the order dated 05.07.2011 passed by the Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as
“the   Tribunal”),   Chandigarh    Bench   in   W.T.A.
No.11,12       &       13/Chandi/95        &      C.O.
No.37/Chandi/95 in W.T.A. No.11/Chandi/95 and
order dated 13.06.2001 in W.T.A. Nos.213, 191 and
192/Chandi/94        and   restored   the   order    of
assessment passed by the Assessing officer for
levying penalty for the entire period of delay in
respect of Assessment Years 1981-82, 1982-83 and
1983-84.
2)    Few facts need mention for disposal of the
appeals.
3)    The appellant is the wealth tax assessee and is
subjected to payment of Wealth Tax under the Act.
The case pertains to the Assessment Years 1981-82,
                                                   2

1982-83 and 1983-84. The issue involved in these
three assessment years was decided by the Tribunal
in favour of the appellant (assessee) which gave rise
to filing of the appeals before the High Court by the
Revenue under Section 27-A of the Act questioning
therein the legality and correctness of the orders of
the Tribunal. As mentioned above, the High Court
allowed the appeals filed by the Revenue, which has
given rise to filing of these appeals by way of special
leave before this Court by the assessee.
4)     The    short    question,  which    arises   for
consideration in these appeals, is whether the High
Court was justified in allowing the appeals filed by
the Revenue and thereby was justified in setting
aside the orders passed by the Tribunal.
5)     Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are inclined to allow the appeals and while setting
aside of the impugned orders of the High Court
                                                   3

remand the case to the High Court for deciding the
appeals afresh on merits after formulating the
substantial questions of law, if it so arises in the
case.
6)    Section 27 - A of the Wealth Tax Act reads as
under
      “27-A Appeal to High Court. —
            (1) The     assessee       or   the    Chief
      Commissioner or Commissioner may within
      one hundred twenty days of the day upon
      which he is served with notice of an order
      under section 24 or section 26 or clause (e) of
      sub-section (1) of section 35, file on or after
      the 1st day of October, 1998 but before the
      date of establishment of the National Tax
      Tribunal appeal before the High Court.
            (1A) The High Court may admit an
      appeal after the expiry of the period of one
      hundred and twenty days referred to in
      sub-section (1), if it is satisfied that there was
      sufficient cause for not filing the same within
      that period.
            (2) An appeal shall lie to the High Court
      before the date of establishment the National
      Tax Tribunal from every order passed in
      appeal by the Appellate Tribunal, under
      sub-section (1) of section 24 only if the High
      Court is satisfied that the case involves a
      substantial question of law.
            (3) In an appeal under this section, the
      Memorandum of Appeal shall precisely state
                                                         4

     the substantial question of law involved in
     the appeal.
           (4) Where the High Court is satisfied
     that a substantial question of law is involved
     in any case, it shall formulate that question.
           (5) The appeal shall be heard only on
     the question so formulated and the
     respondent shall, at the time of hearing of
     the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case
     does not involve such question: Provided that
     nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed
     to take away or abridge the power of the
     Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the
     appeal on any other substantial question of
     law not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that
     the case involves such question.
           (6) The High Court shall decide the
     question of law so formulated and deliver
     such judgment thereon containing the
     grounds on which such decision is founded
     and may award such cost as it deems fit.
           (7) The Assessing Officer shall give
     effect to the order of the High Court on the
     basis of a certified copy of judgment
     delivered under sub-section (6).
           (8) The Provisions of the Code of Civil
     Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) relating to
     appeals to High Court shall, so far as may be,
     apply in the case of appeals under this
     section.”
7)   Section 27-A of the Act, which provides a
remedy of appeal to the High Court against the
order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, is
                                                       5

modeled on existing Section 100 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as “the
Code”). Indeed, as would be clear, the language of
Section 27-A of the Act and Section 100 of the Code
is identical. Both the Sections are, therefore, in pari
materia. It is a case where Section 100 of the Code
is bodily lifted from the Code and incorporated in
Section 27-A of the Act with minor additions and
alterations by following the principle of “legislation
by incorporation".
8)    A three Judge Bench of this Court in Santosh
Hazari vs. Purushottam Tiwari (Deceased) by
L.Rs., (2001) 3 SCC 179 had examined the scope of
Section 100 of the Code of the Civil procedure, 1908
(hereinafter referred to as “the Code”). Justice R.C.
Lahoti (as His Lordship then was) speaking for the
Bench laid down the following proposition of law in
Para 9:
                                                    6

     “9. The High Court cannot proceed to hear a
     second appeal without formulating the
     substantial question of law involved in the
     appeal and if it does so it acts illegally and in
     abnegation or abdication of the duty case on
     Court. The existence of substantial question
     of law is the sine qua non for the exercise of
     the jurisdiction under the amended Section
     100 of the Code. (See Kshitish Chandra
     Purkait v. Santosh Kumar Purkait,(1997) 5
     SCC 438 Panchugopal Barua v. Umesh
     Chandra Goswami, (1997) 4 SCC 413 and
     Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai Sopan
     Gujar, (1999) 3 SCC 722.)”
9)   His Lordship then in Paras 10 to 14 succinctly
explained the meaning of the words “substantial
question of law” and “question of law” and held that
in order to admit the second appeal, what is
required to be made out by the appellant being sine
qua non for exercise of powers under Section 100 of
the Code, is existence of “substantial question of
law” arising in the case so as to empower the High
Court to admit the appeal for final hearing by
formulating such question. In the absence of any
substantial question of law arising in appeal, the
same merits dismissal in limine on the ground that
                                                       7

the appeal does not involve any          substantial
question of law within the meaning of Section 100 of
the Code.
10)   In our considered opinion, the interpretation
made by this Court of Section 100 in Santosh
Hazari’s Case (supra), would equally apply to
Section 27-A of the Act because firstly, both
Sections provide a remedy of appeal to the High
Court;   Secondly,   both  Sections  are   identically
worded and in pari materia; Thirdly, Section 27-A is
enacted by following the principle of “legislation by
incorporation”; fourthly, Section 100 is bodily lifted
from the Code and incorporated as Section 27-A in
the Act; and lastly, since both Sections are akin to
each other in all respects, the appeal filed under
Section 27-A of the Act has to be decided like a
second appeal under Section 100 of the Code.
11)    Now coming to the facts of the case, we find
that the High Court proceeded to decide the appeals
                                                   8

without formulating the substantial question(s) of
law. Indeed, the High Court did not make any effort
to find out as to whether the appeals involved any
substantial question(s) of law and, if so, which
is/are that question(s) and nor it formulated such
question(s), if in its opinion, really arose in the
appeals. The High Court failed to see that it had
jurisdiction to decide the appeals only on the
question(s)    so formulated and      not   beyond it.
[Section 27(5)].
12)   In the light of foregoing discussion and keeping
in view the law laid down in the case of Santosh
Hazari (supra), we are of the considered view that
the impugned orders are not legally sustainable and
thus liable to be set aside.
13)   As a result, the appeals succeed and are
allowed. Impugned orders are set aside. Both the
cases are remanded to the High Court for deciding
                                                   9

the  appeals  afresh  in    accordance           with     the
observations made above.
