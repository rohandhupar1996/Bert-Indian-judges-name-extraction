                                  BEFORE
            HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
20.07.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
        Ms. B Devi and Ms. M Baruah, learned counsel for the petitioners.
        Mr.S Bora, learned counsel for the Respondent.
        This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is directed
against the order dated 30.1.2015 passed by the Central Administrative
Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, whereby it has allowed respondent’s OA
No.040/00027 of 2015.
        The case of respondent before the Tribunal was that through an
Employment Notice, applications were invited from eligible candidates to
fill up Group ‘D’ posts. She, therefore, submitted her candidature and the
Railway Recruitment Cell issued a call letter asking her to appear for
physical efficiency test on 13.4.2011 at the Railway Stadium, Katihar,
Bihar. She appeared and passed the physical efficiency test. But, during
the document verification, the concerned authority disqualified her
candidature on the ground that Madhyama Pass Certificate (equivalent to
matriculation) issued by the Bihar Sanskrit Shiksha Board, Patna was not
recognized by the Railway Board. On 5.3.2014, she was informed that
the certificate is recognized and she should now appear on 29.3.2014 for
her medical examination and document verification. She, therefore, again
appeared and despite everything in her favour, no appointment order
was issued. Aggrieved, she filed OA No.040/00027 of 2015 before the
Tribunal for a direction against the petitioners to appoint her on Group
‘D’ post.
        The record reveals that Respondent had filed Original Application
on 27.1.2015 and on the first day of hearing itself, i.e. 30.1.2015, the
Tribunal, without giving any opportunity to the petitioners to file their
reply, allowed the Original Application with a direction to appoint her on
                                                                 Page 1 of 2

Group ‘D’ post. Also the original record produced by the petitioners
regarding selection reveals that respondent’s candidature for the post in
question was rejected on the ground that old marksheet dated 9.7.2004
submitted by her with the Original Application did not match with her
new marksheet dated 26.9.2011. Her old marksheet showed her having
passed in second division whereas new marksheet showed her passed in
first division. This issue has apparently not been dealt with by the
Tribunal mainly for the reason that no opportunity to file reply was given
to the petitioners. In our considered view, the Tribunal, in all fairness,
must, at least, give reasonable opportunity to the opposite party to file
its reply. We, accordingly, quash the order passed by the Tribunal and
remand the matter for its afresh decision, after giving an opportunity to
the petitioners to file their reply.
        The petition is allowed to the above extent.
             JUDGE                                  CHIEF JUSTICE
