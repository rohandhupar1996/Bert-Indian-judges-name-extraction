*       IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI
                                         Date of decision: 17th July, 2012

        LALITA PARASHAR & ANR.                        ..... Appellant
                           Through:      Mr. O.P. Mannie, Adv.
                    versus
        RANJEET SINGH NEGI & ORS.                     ..... Respondents

        CORAM:
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
                            JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      The Appeal is for enhancement of compensation of `4,60,920/-
        awarded in favour of the Appellants for the death of Ms.
        Neeraja Parashar who died in a motor vehicle accident which
        occurred on 01.08.2008.
2.      On appreciation of evidence, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal
        (the Claims Tribunal) found that the accident was caused on
        account of rash and negligent driving of a DTC bus No.DL-
        1PB-7657 which struck against the two wheeler, on which the
        deceased was travelling as a pillion rider.
3.      The finding on negligence has not been challenged by the
        driver, owner or the Insurance Company and thus, the same has
        become final between the parties.
MAC. APP. 523/2011                                              Page 1 of 8

4.      On quantum of compensation, the Appellants proved a Salary
        Certificate Ex.PW-3/3 to show that the deceased was getting an
        annual salary of `3,31,126/-. The Claims Tribunal, however, did
        not take into consideration the amount paid by the deceased’s
        employer towards the medical, LTA basket, Provident Fund and
        medi-claim premium. The Claims Tribunal thus took the
        deceased’s income to be `11,539/- only i.e. the basic salary and
        HRA to award the loss of dependency.
5.      Following contentions are raised on behalf of the Appellants:-
        (i)        The Claims Tribunal applied the multiplier of ‘7’ as per
                   the age of deceased’s mother it should have been applied
                   as per the age of the deceased. Reliance is placed on
                   P.S.Somanathan & Ors. v. District Insurance Officer &
                   Ors. (2011) 3 SCC 566 and Amrit Bhanu Shali & Ors. v.
                   National Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors. (2012) 6
                   SCALE 1.
        (ii)       The Claims Tribunal erred in assuming the deceased
                   income to be `11,539/ per month. Her income should
                   have been treated as `3,31,126/- per annum as was
                   reflected in the Salary Certificate Ex.PW-3/3.
        (iii)      Deceased was a young girl of 33 years. She had good
                   future prospects.    The Claims Tribunal ought to have
                   granted addition of 50% in the deceased’s income
                   towards the future prospects.

MULTIPLIER:-
6.      It is true that in P.S.Somanathan (supra) and Amrit Bhanu Shali
        (supra) the multiplier was taken as per the age of the deceased.
        However, a reference may be made to a three Judge Bench
        decision of the Supreme Court in              U.P. SRTC v. Trilok
        Chandara, (1996) 4 SCC 362; where the Supreme Court relied
        on       General     Manager,    Kerala    State    Road    Transport
        Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) and Ors.
        (1994) 2 SCC 176; and reiterated that the choice of the
        multiplier is determined by the age of the deceased or that of the
        claimants whichever is more. Para 12 of the report is extracted
        hereunder:-
             “12.        For concluding the analysis it is necessary now
             to refer to the judgment of this Court in the case of
             General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport, v.
             Susamma Thomas: (1994) 2 SCC 176. In that case this
             Court culled out the basic principles governing the
             assessment of compensation emerging from the legal
             authorities cited above and reiterated that the multiplier
             method is the sound method of assessing compensation.
             The Court observed:
                   “The multiplier method involves the ascertainment
                   of the loss of dependency or the multiplicand
                   having regard to the circumstances of the case and
                   capitalizing the multiplicand by an appropriate
                   multiplier. The choice of the multiplier is
                   determined by the age of the deceased (or that of
                   the claimants, whichever is higher) and by the
                   calculation as to what capital sum, if invested at a
                   rate of interest appropriate to a stable economy,
                   would yield the multiplicand by way of annual
MAC. APP. 523/2011                                                 Page 3 of 8

                   interest. In ascertaining this, regard should also be
                   had to the fact that ultimately the capital sum
                   should also be consumed-up over the period for
                   which the dependency is expected to last.
             The principle was explained and illustrated by a
             mathematical example:
                   “The multiplier represents the number of Years'
                   purchase on which the loss of dependency is
                   capitalised. Take for instance a case where annual
                   loss of dependency is Rs. 10,000. If a sum of
                   Rs.1,00,000 is invested at 10% annual interest, the
                   interest will take care of the dependency,
                   perpetually. The multiplier in this case works out
                   to 10. If the rate of interest is 5% per annum and
                   not 10% then the multiplier needed to capitalise
                   the loss of the annual dependency at Rs.10,000
                   would be 20. Then the multiplier i.e., the number
                   of Years' purchase of 20 will yield the annual
                   dependency perpetually. Then allowance to scale
                   down the multiplier would have to be made taking
                   into account the uncertainties of the future, the
                   allowances for immediate lump sum payment, the
                   period over which the dependency is to last being
                   shorter and the capital feed also to be spent away
                   over the period of dependency is to last etc.
                   Usually in English Courts the operative multiplier
                   rarely exceeds 16 as maximum. This will come
                   down accordingly as the age of the deceased
                   person (or that of the dependents, whichever is
                   higher) goes up.”
7.      There is another three Judge Bench decision of the Supreme
        Court in New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Shanti Pathak
        (Smt.) & Ors., (2007) 10 SCC 1, where in the case of death of a
        bachelor, who was aged only 25 years, the multiplier of 5 was
MAC. APP. 523/2011                                                  Page 4 of 8

        applied according to the age of the mother of the deceased, who
        was about 65 years at the time of the accident. Para 6 of the
        report is extracted hereunder:-
             “6. Considering the income that was taken, the
             foundation for working out the compensation cannot be
             faulted. The monthly contribution was fixed at Rs.3,500/-.
             In the normal course we would have remitted the matter
             to the High Court for consideration on the materials
             placed before it. But considering the fact that the matter
             is pending since long, it would be appropriate to take the
             multiplier of 5 considering the fact that the mother of the
             deceased is about 65 years at the time of the accident and
             age of the father is more than 65 years. Taking into
             account the monthly contribution at Rs.3,500/- as held by
             the Tribunal and the High Court, the entitlement of the
             claim would be Rs.2,10,000/-. The same shall bear
             interest @ 7.5% p.a. from the date of the application for
             compensation. Payment already made shall be adjusted
             from the amount due.”
8.      In view of the decision in Trilok Chandara (supra) and Shanti
        Pathak (supra) the multiplier has to be as per the age of the
        deceased or the age of the Claimant whichever is higher. The
        Claims Tribunal was, therefore, right in applying the multiplier
        of ‘7’ according to the age of the deceased’s mother.
MULTIPLICANT
9.      The deceased was getting a salary of `3,31,126/- per annum
        which included of flexi basket of `11,539/- per month. The
        deceased was an unmarried girl aged 33 years and was working
        in a renowned multi-national company. It has to be borne in
MAC. APP. 523/2011                                              Page 5 of 8

        mind that the multi-national companies normally give choice to
        an employee as to how he/she wants to take the package to give
        advantage of deduction under the Income Tax Act.                     The
        deceased had a choice to get the amount of `11,539/- as
        reimbursement towards the conveyance, towards petrol, towards
        mobile phone usage charges, etc. etc. This aspect of the
        compensation package being offered by the multi-national
        companies was highlighted by the Supreme Court in National
        Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Indira Srivastava & Ors., 2008 (2) SCC
        763. Para 10 of the report is extracted hereunder:-
             “10.      Section 168 of the Act uses the word “just
             compensation” which, in our opinion, should be assigned
             a broad meaning. We cannot, in determining the issue
             involved in the matter, lose sight of the fact that the
             private sector companies in place of introducing a
             pension scheme takes recourse to payment of
             contributory Provident Fund, gratuity and other perks to
             attract the people who are efficient and hard-working.
             Different offers made to an officer by the employer, same
             may be either for the benefit of the employee himself or
             for the benefit of the entire family. If some facilities are
             being provided whereby the entire family stands to
             benefit, the same, in our opinion, must be held to be
             relevant for the purpose of computation of total income
             on the basis whereof the amount of compensation
             payable for the death of the kith and kin of the applicants
             is required to be determined……..”
10.     In Raj Rani v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. (2009) 13 SCC 654;
        while relying on Indira Srivastava (supra)¸ the Supreme Court
MAC. APP. 523/2011                                               Page 6 of 8

        reiterated that apart from dearness allowance other allowances
        payable for the benefit of the family, have to be considered for
        the computation of the annual income.
11.     In Pushpabai Purshottam Udeshi v. Ranjit Ginning & Pressing
        Co. (P) Ltd., (1977) 2 SCC 745, it was held that dearness
        allowance, conveyance allowance and other allowances are to
        be treated as part of the deceased’s income.
12.     It is important to note that in case of a bachelor, 50% deduction
        is made towards the personal and living expenses and, therefore
        also no further deduction was required to be made towards any
        of the allowances payable to the deceased.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
13.     The deceased was appointed with NIIT Technology Ltd. by an
        appointment letter dated 04.12.2007. She was on probation for
        a period of one year which could be extended at the discretion
        of her employer. In the circumstances and in the absence of any
        evidence as to the future prospects, the Appellants are not
        entitled to any addition in the deceased’s income for
        computation of loss of dependency.
14.     There was liability of about `15,000/- towards the payment of
        income tax on package of `3,31,126/-.
15.     The loss of dependency thus works out as `11,06,441/-
        (3,31,126/- - 15,000/- x 1/2 x 7).
MAC. APP. 523/2011                                             Page 7 of 8

16.     I would further make a provision of `25,000/- towards loss of
        love and affection, `10,000/- each towards funeral expenses and
        loss to estate.
17.     The overall compensation comes to ` 11,51,441/-.
18.     The enhanced compensation of ` 6,90,521/- shall carry interest
        @ 7.5 % per annum from the date of filing of the Petition till its
        payment, which shall be disbursed equally between the
        Appellants.
19.     Respondent No.3 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company
        Limited is directed to deposit the enhanced compensation along
        with interest with the Claims Tribunal within six weeks.
20.     50% of the enhanced compensation shall be held in fixed
        deposit for a period of two years. Rest shall be released on to
        the Appellants on deposit.
21.     The Appeal is allowed in above terms.
22.     Pending Applications also stand disposed of.
