                               Crl. Pet. No. 708 of 2013
                                             BEFORE
                 HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK

             Heard Mr. Mrinmoy Dutta, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. T.K.
    Mishra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, for the State, Opposite Party No. 1
    and Mr. Gautam Baishya, learned counsel for the Opposite Party No. 2.
    2.       By this Criminal Petition, the petitioner has prayed for quashing of the FIR
    dated 28.03.2012 lodged by the informant/Opposite Party No. 2 before the
    Officer-in-Charge of Dudhnoi Police Station registered as Dudhnoi P.S. Case
    No.30/2012,       corresponding     to    G.R.   No.    634/2012    under    Sections
    341/353/506/323 I.P.C. against her, wherein after investigation of the case, the
    Officer-in-Charge of Dudhnoi Police Station on 30.04.2012 vide No. 30/2012
    already filed the charge-sheet in said Dudhnoi P.S. case.
    3.       It is urged by the petitioner that the said FIR pertaining to Dudhnoi P.S.
    Case No. 30/2012 has been filed by the opposite party No.2 against the petitioner
    only to harass her and as a counter blast to her complaint case against him being
    C.R. Case No. 1279C/2012, wherein the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class,
    Goalpara, by his order dated 16.10.2012 took cognizance of the offences under
    Section 294/354/506 I.P.C. against the said informant/opposite party No. 2
    4.       It is seen from the deposition of the informant/P.W.1/ opposite party No. 2
    herein, recorded during the trial of said G.R. Case No. 634/2012 by the learned
    Trial Magistrate i.e. Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Goalpara on 26.04.2013 that
    while the informant, the Headmaster of Dudhnoi High School, Dudhnoi, on the
    date of incident i.e. on 28.03.2012, was inspecting the class rooms of the school,
    the accused petitioner charged towards him with a view to assault him and during
    that stage, one of the office staff though tried to stop her, she overpowered him
    and again proceeded towards the said informant and it is when he tried to save
    himself, another lady teacher tried to save him from being assaulted; but even
    Crl. Ptn. No. 708 of 2013                                                 Page 1 of 3

the said lady teacher was overpowered by the accused petitioner and she
assaulted him on the school itself and on such assault he sustained injuries and
then, after taking first-aid, he went to the police station and lodged the FIR with
regard to said incident.
5.       In his cross examination on behalf of the petitioner, said informant/P.W. 1
stated that the accused was suspended from her service and before the said
incident she was serving temporarily as Grade-IV in his school and against such
suspension, she approached the High Court at Guwahati and the departmental
enquiry.
6.       The records of the case also disclose that there are sufficient materials
against the accused petitioner with regard to her involvement in the alleged crime
of assaulting the Headmaster of the School/the informant/opposite party No. 2 for
her personal grudge. From the case record, it is also seen that the learned Trial
Magistrate has already recorded the statement of three prosecution witnesses,
including the statement of the informant/P.W.1/opposite party No. 2 and while
the said trial was in progress, this petition was moved. In the trial of the case,
statement of the eye-witnesses to the incident, i.e., the prosecution witness Nos.
2 and 3, namely, Prabin Basumatary, the male teacher who first tried to stop the
accused as well as the P.W. 3, Sewali Kalita, the lady teacher, who tried to stop
the accused from assaulting the informant victim, were also recorded by the Trial
Magistrate, who were also cross examined by the petitioner and said P.Ws 2 & 3
deposed similar to the deposition of the informant/P.W.1 named above.
7.       Considering the above, the Court is of the view that it is not a fit case to
interfere with the proceedings of said G.R. Case No. 634 of 2012 pending before
the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Goalpara arising out of Dudhnoi P.S.
Case No.30/2012, in exercise of the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C..
8.       Accordingly, this criminal petition being devoid of merit sands dismissed.
Crl. Ptn. No. 708 of 2013                                                  Page 2 of 3

9.       The interim order passed earlier in this case on 18.09.2013 suspending the
proceeding of said G.R. Case No. 634 of 2013 stands vacated.
10.      Registry shall return the L.C.R. to the Court of learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Goalpara, along with a copy of the order forthwith.
                                                                    JUDGE
