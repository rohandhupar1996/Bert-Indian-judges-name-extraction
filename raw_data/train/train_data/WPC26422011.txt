                                                                  ............  Petitioners
                                             - Versus –
                                      The State of Assam and others
                                                                    ........ Respondents
                                             BEFORE
                       HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.M. BUJOR BARUA
                       For the petitioners:      Mr. P. Mahanta, Adv
                       For the respondents:      Ms. R.B. Bora, SC, BTC.
                                                 Mr. D.P. Borah, SC, Health Dept.
                      Date of Hearing :         10.07.2017.
                      Date of Judgment:        10.07.2017.
                          JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
              Heard Mr. P. Mahanta, learned counsel for the petitioners, Ms. R.B.
      Bora, learned counsel appearing for the BTC being the respondent Nos. 2 and
      5 and Mr. D.P. Borah, learned Standing Counsel for the Health Department
      being the respondent Nos. 1, 3 and 4. Although the candidates, who were
      appointed pursuant to the impugned selection have also been impleaded as
      respondent Nos. 6 to 12 by a subsequent order of this Court, but in view of
      the order that is proposed to be passed today, this Court is of the view that
      the said respondents need not be heard for the present.
      2.      The petitioner No.1 having obtained the diploma in Laboratory
      Technology from the Institute of Medical and Paramedical Science, Silchar in
      the year 2000, the petitioner No.2 having obtained the diploma in Laboratory
      Technology from the North East Medical and Paramedical College, a unit of
      Humanities Research Development (Government of Assam), located in the
WP(C) No.2642 of 2011                                                            Page 1 of 3

      Training Campus at Kokrajhar, Assam in the year 2008 and the petitioner
      No.3 having obtained one year diploma course in Laboratory Technology in
      the year 2003, had participated in a selection process pursuant to an
      advertisement dated 13.11.2009 issued by the Central Selection Board of the
      BTC authorities.
      3.      On a perusal of the said advertisement of 13.11.2009, it is seen that
      the minimum educational qualification is a certificate of Laboratory Technician
      Training Course from Government recognized institute of Assam. The
      petitioners duly participated in the said selection process pursuant to the
      advertisement of 13.11.2009 and the results were declared as per the
      Annexure-F dated 11.11.2010. As per the said result, in respect of the posts
      in the category of Laboratory Technician, which is 12 in number, the
      petitioner No.1 bearing Roll No.178, the petitioner No.2 bearing Roll No.76
      and the petitioner No.3 bearing Roll No.29, were declared to have been
      selected.
      4.      The petitioners are aggrieved that although they were selected as per
      the said result declared on 11.11.2010, but no appointments were made in
      their favour. On the other hand, the respondent authorities had issued
      another advertisement published in the newspaper “The Assam Tribune”
      dated 09.02.2011, which also advertised for certain posts of Laboratory
      Technician. The result of the subsequent selection procedure pursuant to the
      advertisement of 09.02.2011 was declared in the result sheet dated
      28.12.2011, which was published in the newspaper “Dainik Agradoot” dated
      02.03.2011. As per the said result, certain other persons were selected for six
      posts of Laboratory Technician.
      5.      It is the case of the petitioners that although they were selected
      pursuant to the earlier advertisement, but their selection was abandoned and
      the respondent authorities by issuing the subsequent advertisement had
      proceeded to appoint the respondent Nos. 6 to 12.
      6.      The BTC authorities had filed an affidavit in opposition dated
      29.06.2011, wherein in paragraph-4, it had been stated that pursuant to the
      earlier advertisement of 13.11.2009, five candidates were appointed, but the
      other candidates whose name also appeared in the select list were not
      appointed inasmuch as, the said candidates did not have a certificate of
      Laboratory Technician Training Course from a Government recognized
WP(C) No.2642 of 2011                                                          Page 2 of 3

      institute of Assam. It is stated that pursuant to the earlier selection, the five
      candidates who had been appointed, had the required certificate, but the
      other selected candidates, like the petitioners did not have the concerned
      certificate of Laboratory Technician Training Course from a Government
      recognized institute of Assam.
      7.       In paragraph-6 of the affidavit in opposition, the respondent BTC
      authorities also takes a stand that the certificate of Laboratory Technician
      Training Course from a Government recognized institute of Assam is
      mandatory as per the directions issued by the Government of Assam pursuant
      to a decision of this Court in WP(C) No.3274/1995.
      8.       On a perusal of the materials on record, it is seen that the petitioners
      had obtained their certificates of Laboratory Technician Training Course from
      institutes, which are other than recognized institutes of the State of Assam. In
      such view of the matter, no infirmity can be found in not appointing the
      petitioners pursuant to the earlier selection inasmuch as, they do not have the
      required qualification as per the advertisement dated 13.11.2009.
      9.       In such view of the matter, no interference is also required in the in
      the selection of the respondent Nos. 6 to 12, who were appointed after a due
      selection pursuant to the subsequent advertisement dated 09.02.2011.
      10.      In such view of the matter, this writ petition is found to be devoid of
      any merit.
      11.      However, at the stage, Mr. P. Mahanta, learned counsel for the
      petitioners makes a prayer that if the respondent authorities intend to take a
      lenient view on the same, the cases of the petitioners for appointment may
      also be considered accordingly.
      12.      In such view of the matter, by making it clear that it is not a specific
      direction of this Court, it is provided that it is left open to the discretion of the
      respondent authorities to give a lenient consideration to the petitioners, as
      prayed for, in the event the respondent authorities desire to do so.
               In terms of the above, this writ petition stands closed.
                                                                                 JUDGE
