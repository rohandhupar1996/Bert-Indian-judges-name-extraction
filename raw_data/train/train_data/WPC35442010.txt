                             W.P.(C) No. 3544 of 2010
                                           BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
            Heard Mr. Ramani Mohan Choudhury learned counsel for the petitioners.
    Also heard Mr. Narayan Sarma, learned Standing Counsel Education Department for
    the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3, Mr. Anan Kumar Bhuyan, learned Standing Counsel
    BTC appearing for respondent Nos. 4 to 6 and Mr. Budha Gogoi, learned Standing
    Counsel, Finance Department appearing for the respondent No. 7.
            The claims of the petitioners herein are that in spite of their selection and
    approval as Assistant Teacher in various L.P./M.E./M.V. Schools under the
    jurisdiction of BTAD now BTC, they have not been appointed. The petitioners
    earlier approached this Court preferring WP(C) No. 7783/2003 and that by order
    dated 04.11.2003 this Court disposed of the said writ petition of the petitioners
    with the observation that the respondent authority shall not appoint any person
    outside the select list dated 28.05.2003 and that as and when appointments are
    made from the selection list, such appointment shall be made strictly on merit
    subject to on the basis of reservation policy.
            It is submitted by the petitioners that though said order of the Court was
    placed before the respondent authority, but they were not appointed for which they
    filed several representations which have not been considered by the respondents.
    The petitioners further stated that the by order dated 15.03.2010, the respondent
    BTC cancelled the select list dated 10.08.2002 selecting and approving the
    petitioners under the Bodoland Autonomous Council disregarding their claims and
    as such preferred this writ petition for quashing of the decision of the BTC
    authorities dated 15.03.2010 in cancelling the said select list dated 10.08.2002 and
    to consider their appointment in terms of the order 04.11.2003 passed in WP(C)
    7783/2003.
            The petitioners contended that pursuant to an advertisement, the selection
    committee selected the petitioners for the post of Assistant Teachers in
    W.P.(C) No. 3544 of 2012                                                  Page 1 of 4

provincialised L.P/M.E/M.V schools in the BTC areas, but appointments were not
given to them in spite of their such selection.
         It is seen that though the petitioners are claiming for their appointments on
the basis of the order passed earlier on 04.11.2003 passed in WP(C) No. 7783 of
2003, from the perusal of the records, the BTC authorities found that the alleged
select list approved by the then BAC authority on 28.05.2003 cannot be termed as
a select list as per the Assam Elementary Education (Provincialisation) Rules 1977,
since the said select list was not approved by the concerned Member Secretary as
well as the Chairman and the other members of the concerned Advisory Board and
that it was found that the same was done only at the behest of the Chief of the
erstwhile Bodoland Executive Council and that excepting him, none of the members
like the Chairman, Member Secretary of Advisory Board and others , as required,
signed the alleged select list. It is also seen that the Chairman of the Advisory
Board is not a competent authority to publish advertisement unilaterally for the
post of Assistant Teacher in any provincialised L.P./M.E./M.V. schools under the
erstwhile BAC area and it is only the Member Secretary, who is the authorized
person to make such advertisement on behalf of the Government of Assam.
Moreover, there were no such specific approvals to the erstwhile BAC authority for
making such Advertisement for selection of candidates. The petitioners have also
not annexed any copy of the advertisement made by the authority concerned for
filling up of the post of Assistant Teachers in any provincialised L.P/M.E./M.V. under
the BTC area on the basis of which they are claiming that on 28.05.2003 such
select list was approved by Secretary, BAC.
          It is also seen that a Division Bench of this Court in Review Petition No. 87
of 2011 in Writ Appeal No. 351/2007 considered similar aspects of the matter
pertaining to Chirang district of BTC and dismissed the said review petition
preferred by such selected candidates for the post of Assistant Teachers under the
BTC areas, upholding the earlier order dated 27.4.2010 dismissing the writ appeal,
preferred by those candidates.
W.P.(C) No. 3544 of 2012                                                   Page 2 of 4

        The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Bihar -Vs- Upindera
Narayan Singh reported in (2009) 5 SCC 65 as well as in the case of State of Orissa
and another -Vs- Mamata Mahanty reported in (2011) 3 SCC 436 have held that –
        “it is a settled legal proposition that no person can be appointed even on a
        temporary or ad-hoc basis without inviting applications from all eligible
        candidates and that advertisement in news paper is mandatory requirement
        for a valid public appointment. If any appointment is made by merely inviting
        names from the Employment Exchange or putting a note on a Notice Board
        etc. that will not meet the requirement of Article 14 and 15 of the
        Constitution and such a course violates the mandates of Article 14 and 16 of
        Constitution of India as it deprives the candidates who are eligible for the
        post from being considered. A person employed in violation of this provision
        is not entitled to any relief including salary. For a valid and legal appointment
        mandatory compliance of said constitutional requirement is to be fulfilled.
        The equality clause and enshrined in Article 16 requires that every such
        advertisement be made by an open advertisement as to enable the entire
        eligible person to compete on merit. It is settled legal proposition that if an
        order is bad in its inception, it does not get sanctified at a later stag and
        subsequent action/development cannot validate an action which was not
        lawful at its inception, for the reason that the illegality strikes at the root of
        the order. It would be beyond the competence of any authority to validate
        such an order. It would be ironic to permit a person to rely upon a law, in
        violation of which he has obtained the benefits. If an order at the initial stage
        is bad in law then all further proceeding consequent thereto will be nonest
        and have to be naturally set aside. A right in law exist only and only when it
        has a lawfully origin. The concepts of adverse possession of lien of post or
        holding over are not applicable in service jurisprudence and therefore,
        continuation of a person wrongly appointed on post does not create any right
        in his favour.”
        Considering the above and that the approval of the then Chief of the Bodo
  Land Executive Council by his signature dated 28.05.2003 on a select list
  purportedly prepared on 10.08.2002 in violation of the statutory provisions of the
  Assam Elementary Education (Provincialisation) Rules, a Rule framed under
  Article 309 of the Constitution, relating to recruitment and condition of services of
  teachers of elementary schools cannot be considered to be genuine and valid and
  as such the Court does not find any infirmity with the order dated 15.03.2010
  passed by the Secretary, Bodo Land Territorial Council under Memo No.
  BTC/Edn(E1).474/08/104        in   cancelling   the   select   list dated    10.08.2002
  mentioning the orders dated 04.11.2003 passed in W.P(C) No. 7783/2003 as well
  as the order dated 27.04.2009 passed in WP(C) No.2300/2008.
W.P.(C) No. 3544 of 2012                                                       Page 3 of 4

       Accordingly, this writ petition being devoid of merit stands dismissed.
                                                                    JUDGE
