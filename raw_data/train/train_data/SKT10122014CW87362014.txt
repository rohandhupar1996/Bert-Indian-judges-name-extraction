4.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that
pre-deposit is not required to be deposit in view of the decision taken by this
Court in various judgments.
5.     Learned counsel has relied upon the case of M/s. Old Village
Industries Ltd. v. the Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner, Employees’
Provident Fund Organisation & Anr. 2005 LLR 552 whereby this Court
held as under:
              “The power to waive or reduce the amount to be
              deposited is relatively to the amount determined by
              the Officer under section 7A of the Act. In order
              words, the pre-requisite of deposit of 75% of the
              demanded amount applicable to an order passed
              under section 7A and not to other provisions. The
              Legislature in its own wisdom has restricted the
              application of the provisions of section 7(1) to the
              order passed under section 7A. Such provisions
              are to be construed strictly and cannot be given a
              wider meaning so as to create a liability which is
              intended to be correct to the entertainment of an
              appeal. The liability to deposit arises in the
              situation strictly contemplated under the
              provisions of this section. There is nothing in the
              section so as to extend its application to an order
              passed under section 14B of the Act. An employer
              has a right to prefer an appeal against an order
              under section 14B, under section 7(1) of the Act
              but the pre-condition of deposit for entertainment
              of such an appeal is not covered under section 7-
              (O) of the Act. Thus, I have no hesitation in
              rejecting the contention of the respondents that it
W.P. (C) 8736/2014                                         Page 2 of 4

              would be mandatory for the employer to deposit
              75% of such amount before appeal can be
              entertained or even that there cannot be stay of
              recovery of the said amount by the Appellate
              Authority. The argument raised on behalf of the
              respondents would be untenable even for another
              reason that damage is the consequence of the
              demand raised under section 7A of the Act. The
              provisions of section 14B of the Act attracted only
              if there is default on the part of the employer. It
              being a consequential liability essentially must fall
              in a category of not the principal liability to attract
              stringent provisions of pre-deposit to the hearing
              of the appeal. Such provisions being related to
              revenue would be construed strictly whether to the
              advantage or disadvantage of the person upon
              whom the liability is sought to be fastened. Once
              the provisions of section 7-O does not include an
              appeal against an order under section 14B then it
              would be in no way permissible to include such an
              order by implication or otherwise.”
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that similar view
has been taken by this Court in W.P.(C) Nos.1148/2010 and 3176/2013
decided on 24.02.2010 and 15.05.2013 respectively.
7.     Learned counsel for the respondent appearing on advance notice does
not dispute the law settled by this Court in case of M/s Old Village
Industries ltd. (supra).

8.     In view of the above the order dated 15.09.2014 is modified to the
extent that the Tribunal shall hear the appeal of the petitioner without
insisting pre-deposit of Rs.10 Lac.
9.     The petition is allowed with the aforesaid observations.
       C.M.No.20080/2014 (Stay)
       With the disposal of the instant petition, instant application has
become infructuous and disposed of as such.
