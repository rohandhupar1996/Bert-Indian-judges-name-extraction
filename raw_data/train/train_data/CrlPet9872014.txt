                                Crl. Pet. No. 987 of 2014
                                            BEFORE
                  HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
             Heard Dr. Burhanuddin Ahmed, learned counsel for the petitioners. Also
    heard Mr. T.K. Misra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent
    Nos.1 & 3.
             Though notice was served on respondent No. 4 and his engaged counsel
    filed power, but said respondent refrained from appearing in the matter.
             The petitioners herein are Government employees under the Co-operation
    Department of the State. Brief facts of the case is that the Respondent No. 4 on
    30.08.2014 lodged an FIR before the Senior Superintendent of Police, Guwahati
    City regarding illegal collection of money by a Cooperative Society, namely,
    Janashakti Byabasai Samabai Samitee Limited, Jyotishree Nagar, Jyotikuchi, Lakhra
    Road, Udalbakra, Guwahati-34 alleging that the said Cooperative Society is having
    a grocery shop at Jyotishree Nagar which is only an eye wash for the public, but
    the said Society, in the previous year, siphoned huge sums money through illegal
    banking business and the said co-operative society drained out major part of its
    fund for the personal benefit of the members of the said Samabai Samitee. In the
    said FIR it is also alleged that some of the Government officials like, the then
    Additional Chief Secretary of the State, Registrar, Assistant Registrar and Zonal
    Joint Registrar of the Co-operative Societies, Assam though informed in writing
    about the illegal banking business of the said Samabai Samitee and is involved in
    illegal collection of public money, but those Government personnel, who could have
    stopped the illegal business of the society, but remained silent and mere spectator,
    and allowed the said Samabai Samitee to continue such illegal business and for that
    those Government officials are also equally guilty.
             On receipt of the said FIR, the Senior Superintendent of Police vide No.
    R/GB/3647/Crime dated 01.09.2014 forwarded the same to the Officer-in-Charge of
    Fatasil Ambari Police Station to register the same and for its necessary
    investigation. Accordingly, the said complaint of the informant/Respondent No.4
    Crl. Ptn. No. 987 of 2014                                              Page 1 of 5

had been registered and numbered as Fatasil Ambari Police Station Case No.
791/2014 (corresponding to GR No. 9635/2014) under Sections 120(B)/420/166 (A)
IPC.
         In the said FIR dated 30.08.2014 of the respondent No. 4, pertaining to said
Fatasil Ambari PS Case No. 791/2014 the petitioners herein who are Government
employees under the Co-operation Department of the State have been specifically
named alleging that those are the Government officials, who slept over the matter
in spite of written complaint against the said Samabai Samitee.
         Hence this criminal petition by the petitioners for quashing the said Fatasil
Ambari P.S. Case No. 791/2014 against them.
         The Court, while issuing notice to the respondents on 10.12.2014, in the
interim stayed the further proceeding of said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 791/2014
against the petitioners which is still in force.
         The petitioners submitted that they are no way connected with any of the
illegal activities of said Samabai Samitee involved with the case and that their
names have been illegally implicated by the informant/respondent No.4. The
petitioners also submitted that there is already an FIR filed against the President
and Secretary of the said Samabai Samitee for which a criminal proceeding under
the Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 302/2013 under Sections 406/420 IPC is already
pending.
         Dr. Ahmed, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that earlier some of
the members of the said Samabai Samitee, namely, Ajmat Ali Khan and seven
others on 26.05.2014 lodged a complaint before the Registrar of Co-operative
Societies alleging some illegal banking business by the said samitee, pursuant to
which, an enquiry was conducted by the Zonal Joint Registrar of Co-operative
Societies, Guwahati Zone and submitted its report before the Registrar of Co-
operative societies, Assam, by forwarding copies of said report to the concerned
applicants, including the Chairman and Secretary of the said samitee. It is stated
that the findings of the said enquiry officer is that the said Samabai Samitee
received deposits within and from the members of the samitee itself and not
involved with illegal activities of banking as alleged and does not receive
Crl. Ptn. No. 987 of 2014                                                Page 2 of 5

investment other than the samitee members as appeared from the documentary
evidence of the said Samabai Samitee.
         Dr. Ahmed also placed before the Court that the informant/respondent No.
4, earlier on 23.05.2014 sought for information through RTI from the State Public
Information Officer (SPIO) of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies regarding
banking business of the said Samabai Samitee and with regard to that after proper
investigation, said SPIO-cum-Society Registrar vide its communication under No.
CKGO/32/97/Pt-2/91 dated 04.06.2014 informed the respondent No. 4 that the
banking business of the society was stopped after the order issued by the Registrar
of Co-operative societies, Assam under Memo No. CMP/17/2011/88 dated
31.10.2012 and that no permission was granted to the said Samabai Samitee for
sale its land.
         Dr. Ahmed, learned counsel for the petitioners also submits that FIR dated
30.08.2014 with regard to said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 791/2014 against the
petitioners be quashed as they being the Government officials are no way
connected with any of the alleged illegal activities of the said samitee and that the
said FIR has been filed by the respondent No. 4 with malafide intention only to
harass them in discharging their illegal activities.
         Considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for petitioners. It
is seen that for the same allegation of illegal banking business by the said Samabai
Samitee, a criminal proceeding being Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 302/2013 has
already been registered and is presently pending for order in final form. Moreover,
the Office of the Registrar, Co-operative Societies enquired into the matter
regarding banking business by the said samitee and thereafter, the Registrar of the
Co-operative Societies, Assam vide Memo No. CMP/17/2011/88 dated 31.10.2012
stopped any such banking business of the said samitee. Further, it is also seen
that in this regard the Zonal Joint Registrar of the Co-operative Societies, Guwahati
made an enquiry under Section-88 of the Assam Co-operative Societies Act, 2007
and on 31.07.2013 submitted his report stating that the said Samabai Samitee is no
longer involved any such banking business as alleged.
Crl. Ptn. No. 987 of 2014                                                 Page 3 of 5

         It is to be noted herein that after the new Co-operative Societies Act, 2007
after its amended provisions came into force w.e.f. 05.03.2012 and thereafter in
February, 2013; it is the Board of Directors of the Co-operative society which
manages the society as per the provisions of Assam Co-Operatives Societies Act,
2007 as amended and the said Board of Directors has the power and authority to
appoint concerned Secretary.
         As per the provisions of Section 63 of the said 2007 Act as amended, a
Cooperative society can mobilisation its fund, by raising the same in the shape of
equity, capital deposits and loan from its members to the specified extent as
decided by the Board of Directors of the society and under the terms and
conditions specified in such loans of the concerned society. Further, said provisions
of the 2007 Act, as amended also provides that such Co-operative society may also
borrow individually and institutionally to an extent and under the conditions as
specified in the bye-laws of the society.
         Section 70 of said 2007 Act as amended put restrictions on the borrowing
by the Co-operative society concerned and Section 51 of 2007 Act as amended
provides for issuing loan to the members of the society which are required to be
utilised by its members for the purpose for which it was advanced. As such the
2007 Act as amended itself provides banking business with certain limitations on
the Co-operative society as provided under Sections 51, 63 and 70 of said Act.
         From the FIR of the respondent No. 4 dated 30.08.2014 pertaining to said
Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 791/2014 it can be clearly seen that he has only
invited for investigation of the case with regard to the Board of Director as well as
its Secretary of said Samabai Samitee and for panel action only against them with
regard to their illegal collection public money.
         Considering the above and that for the same issue a criminal proceeding
being Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 302/2013 is already existing, in that backdrop,
the Court is of the view that if the proceeding of said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No.
791/2014 is allowed to continue against the petitioners on the basis of said FIR
dated 30.08.2014 of the respondent No. 4; it would be an abuse of the process of
the Court and would cause unnecessary harassment to the petitioners.
Crl. Ptn. No. 987 of 2014                                                Page 4 of 5

         As such for the ends of justice, in exercise of the power conferred under
Section 482 CrPC, the FIR dated 30.08.2014 lodged by the respondent
No.3/informant against the petitioners herein with regard to said Fatasil Ambari
P.S. Case No. 791/2014 is set aside and quashed. Consequently, the proceeding of
said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 791/2014, corresponding to GR Case No.
9635/2014 against the present petitioners are also set aside and quashed.
         The interim order passed earlier in this proceeding on 10.12.2014 shall
stand merged with this order.
         This criminal petition accordingly stands allowed.
                                                                  JUDGE
