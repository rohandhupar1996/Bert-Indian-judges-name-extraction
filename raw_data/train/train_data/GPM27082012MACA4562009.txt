        by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal(the Claims Tribunal) in favour of
        the Appellant for having suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident
        which occurred on 05.01.2001.
2.      In the absence of any Appeal by the driver, owner and the Delhi
        Transport Corporation, the finding on negligence has attained finality.
3.      The Appellant suffered crush injury on his left foot and ankle and fracture
        of right femur and tibia. He was hospitalized in All India Institute of
        Medical Sciences (AIIMS) (from 05.01.2001 to 02.03.2001 and then
        from 22.03.2002 to 24.04.2002). On 26.01.2001, external fixator was

        applied. It was removed on 15.02.2001 and POP Cast was done. Second
        grafting on the wounds was done during the first stint of hospitalization.
        At the time of second operation, plates were fixed to give support to the
        bones. The Appellant remained an outdoor patient for a period of three
        years. The Appellant was issued a disability certificate Ex.PW3/B by
        AIIMS declaring him to have suffered 75% permanent physical
        impairment in relation to his right lower limb, a post traumatic deformity
        of right lower limb with restricted hip, knee, ankle joint movements and
        pseudoarthrosis of thigh. The Claims Tribunal awarded a compensation
        of `7,30,000/- which is detailed hereunder in a tabulated form:

4.      It was one of the grounds of the Appeal that the Appellant needed future
        treatment in respect of the injuries.       An Application for additional
        evidence moved by the Appellant was allowed. He examined himself as
        AW1 and proved documents Mark AW1/1 to AW1/32 in respect of the
        treatment and expenditure incurred by him. He also examined AW2 Dr.
        Anmol Maria, a Consultant Orthopaedic & Joint Replacement Surgeon
        from Primus Super Specialty Hospital (Primus Hospital) who carried
        corrective osteotomy of right femur of the Appellant on 26.09.2009. He
        proved the prescriptions Mark AW1/1 to AW1/4. The bill issued by
        Primus Hospital is Mark AW1/15. He also proved some receipts in
        respect of the consultation fee charged by him. Dr. Anmol Maria’s
        (AW2) testimony is extracted hereunder:
                  “The patient Mr. Faizal came to me for the first time on
           22.7.2009. His primary treatment was done in All India Institute
           of Medical Sciences following a road accident in the year 2001.
           At AIIMS, the appellant had been treated for multiple fractures
           of right lower limb. When he came to me he complained of
           difficulty in walking and shortening of the right leg.
                  I prescribed x-rays to be done, reports whereof reveal
           deformity in the right femur (thigh bone) and totally deformed
           knee-joint. I advised surgery for correction of the deformities as
           the first stage of treatment. My prescription dated 22.7.2009
           (earlier Mark AW1/1) is in my hand it bears my signatures. The
           same is Ex.AW2/1. On 24.7.2009, after seeing the report of x-
           rays, I advised the treatment to be done in three stages. My
           prescription, therefor, is Ex.AW2/2 (earlier Mark AW1/2. The
           prescription is in my hand, it bears my signatures.
                  The patient came to me on 23.9.2009 & 24.9.2009, wherein
           he was advised to be admitted at Primus Hospital on 26.9.2009.
           The said prescription dated 23.9.2009 (earlier MarkAW1/3) is
           Ex.AW2/3 and prescription dated 24.9.2009 (earlier Mark
           AW1/4) is Ex.AW2/4. The patient was admitted to Primus
           Hospital on 26.9.2009, and corrective Osteotomy of right femur
MAC.APP. No.456/2009                                              Page 3 of 15

           was done on 26.9.2009 at the patient was discharged on
           28.9.2009. Mark Aw1/15 is the bill raised by Primus Super
           Specialty Hospital in respect of the corrective surgery done by
           me on the appellant. The appellant also visited me on
           5.10.2009, and paid me profession charges `1300/-. The
           receipts dated 5.10.2009 (page-24 annexed with the affidavit of
           evidence) are Ex.AW2/5 & AW2/6 (earlier Mark AW1/17). The
           appellant also paid me `400/- vide receipt dated 19.10.2009
           (earlier Mark AW1/24, which is Ex.AW2/7. On 5.10.2010 I
           advised the appellant to undergo physiotherapy, my prescription
           to this effect is Ex.AW2/8 (earlier Mark AW1/8).
                  For the second stage of treatment I advised the appellant
           either to undergo knee-joint replacement cost whereof would be
           approximate `1,75,000/- or in the alternative fusion of the knee-
           joint to be done cost whereof may be slightly less than that. The
           said surgery could be done two months hence. In the third stage
           of the treatment, I advised the appellant to undergo lengthening
           of the limb cost whereof would be `1,10,000/-. The cost of the
           treatment advised on 24.7.2009 was in respect of what was
           prevalent at that time, the cost may escalate by the passing of
           time.
           xxxxxx by Ms. Arati Mahajan Shedha, counsel for the
           respondent.
                  It is correct that there is an economy ward in Primus Super
           Specialty Hospital. It is also correct that the cost of twin
           sharing room is more than the economy ward.
                  In my opinion the three stages of surgery advised by me
           were essential. Different Orthopaedic Surgeons may have
           different prescriptions of treatment of the patient. Any other
           Orthopaedic Surgeon may advise the treatment to be done in a
           different manner.
           Q.            Is it true that in between 2001 and 2003, when the
           surgeries were performed initially and 2009 when the patient
           came to you some intervening factors/carelessness may have
           aggravated the condition of the Appellant?
           A.            The condition of the patient in 2009 was
           commensurate with the documents shown to me in respect of the
MAC.APP. No.456/2009                                              Page 4 of 15

            surgeries performed in the years 2001 and/or 2003. There was
            nothing for me to suspect any injury in the intervening period.”
5.      The following contentions are raised on behalf of the Appellant:
        (i)       No compensation was awarded towards loss of income for
                  the period the Appellant was away from work; he was
                  incapacitated to carry any work for a period of three years.
        (ii)      The Appellant was awarded compensation on the basis of
                  minimum wages. No addition towards future prospects or
                  inflation was made.
        (iii)     Compensation of `20,000/- awarded towards attendant
                  charges was very low.
        (iv)      No compensation was awarded towards future treatment.
        (v)       The compensation awarded towards non-pecuniary damages
                  is low and meagre.
        (vi)      The compensation towards special diet and conveyance is on
                  the lower side.
6.      Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988(the Act) enjoins payment of
        just compensation.         In General Manager, Kerala Road Transport
        Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas & Ors., (1994) 2 SCC
        176, the Supreme Court held as under: -
             “5……The determination of the quantum must answer what
             contemporary society "would deem to be a fair sum such as would
             allow the wrongdoer to hold up his head among his neighbours
             and say with their approval that he has done the fair thing". The
             amount awarded must not be niggardly since the law values life
             and limb in a free society in generous scales'. All this means that
             the sum awarded must be fair and reasonable by accepted legal
             standards.”

   7.        In Arvind Kumar Mishra v. New India Assurance Company Limited,
             (2010) 10 SCC 254, the Supreme Court dealt with the case of
             disability of an engineering student. The Supreme Court observed that
             while awarding compensation in personal injury cases, an attempt
             should be made to put the injured in the same position as he was as far
             as money is concerned. In para 9 of the report, the Supreme Court held
             as under:
             “9.         We do not intend to review in detail state of authorities in
             relation to assessment of all damages for personal injury. Suffice
             it to say that the basis of assessment of all damages for personal
             injury is compensation. The whole idea is to put the claimant in
             the same position as he was insofar as money can. Perfect
             compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that
             the victim has done no wrong; he has suffered at the hands of the
             wrongdoer and the court must take care to give him full and fair
             compensation for that he had suffered.”
   8.        In Nizam‟s Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth S. Dhananka &
             Ors., (2009) 6 SCC 1, the Supreme Court emphasized that cases of
             serious injuries in motor vehicle accident are worse than the death
             cases because the victim and his family suffers throughout life. Para
             90 of the report is extracted hereunder:-
                  “90. At the same time we often find that a person injured in
                  an accident leaves his family in greater distress vis-à-vis a
                  family in a case of death. In the latter case, the initial
                  shock gives way to a feeling of resignation and acceptance,
                  and in time, compels the family to move on. The case of an
                  injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and
                  the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often
                  destitution enures every day. The support that is needed by
                  a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous
MAC.APP. No.456/2009                                                Page 6 of 15

                  price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the
                  victim but even more so on his family and attendants and
                  the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity.”
9.      The heads under which compensation is awarded in personal injury cases
        are the following:
             Pecuniary damages (Special Damages)
             (i) Expenses relating to           treatment, hospitalization,
             medicines,        transportation,   nourishing     food,         and
             miscellaneous expenditure.
             (ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured
             would have made had he not been injured, comprising:
             (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment;
             (b) Loss of future earnings on account of permanent
             disability.
             (iii) Future medical expenses.
             Non-pecuniary damages (General Damages)
             (iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a
             consequence of the injuries.
             (v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage).
             (vi) Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal
             longevity).
             In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be
             awarded only under heads (i), (ii)(a) and (iv). It is only in
             serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical
             evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant, that
             compensation will be granted under any of the heads (ii)(b),
             (iii), (v) and (vi) relating to loss of future earnings on
             account of permanent disability, future medical expenses,
MAC.APP. No.456/2009                                                Page 7 of 15

             loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage) and
             loss of expectation of life.” (Per Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar
             & Anr., 2011 (1) SCC 343)).
LOSS OF INCOME:
10.     In his affidavit produced by way of evidence before the Claims Tribunal,
        the Appellant testified that he was working as a sales representative of
        motor parts and was earning `4,500/- per month. He also deposed that he
        was doing graduation from Annamalai University. The Appellant did not
        produce any evidence as to where he was supplying the motor parts. No
        proof of income or of his employment or of him being a self-employed
        person was filed. In the circumstances, the Claims Tribunal awarded the
        compensation taking minimum wages of a matriculate. As held in Raj
        Kumar, the Appellant was entitled to damages for loss of income during
        the period he was unable to attend to his work at all. In his affidavit, the
        Appellant testified that he was totally bed-ridden for a period of three
        years. No expert evidence was produced nor any doctor was examined to
        prove that the Appellant needed three years to recover from the injuries.
        Of course, it has come in evidence that the Appellant needed future
        treatment. That, by itself, would not show that the Appellant was unable
        to attend to his work for a period of three years. At the same time, it
        cannot be lost sight that the Appellant remained hospitalized from
        05.01.2001 to 02.03.2001 and then from 22.03.2002 to 24.02.2002. The
        Appellant would have taken another couple of months to recover from the
        injuries after his second surgery. Thus, I would assume he was unable to
        attend to his work for a period of at least 18 months. He is entitled to
        compensation amounting to `54,540/-(`3030 x 18).

LOSS OF EARNING CAPACITY:
11.     As per disability certificate Ex.PW3/B, the Appellant had suffered 75%
        permanent physical impairment in relation to his right lower limb, a post
        traumatic deformity of right lower limb with restricted hip, knee, ankle
        joint movements and pseudoarthrosis of thigh. The disability is quite
        serious. No expert evidence was produced by the Appellant as to the
        handicap on account of disability, although, AW2 Dr. Anmol Maria from
        Primus Hospital was examined by way of additional evidence before the
        Registrar.
12.     In Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar & Anr., 2011 (1) SCC 343, the Supreme
        Court brought out the difference between permanent disability and
        functional disability resulting in the loss of earning capacity. It was laid
        down that the compensation on account of loss of earning capacity has to
        be granted in accordance to the nature of job undertaken by the victim of
        motor accident. Paras 11 and 14 of the report are extracted hereunder:
                  “11. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is the
                  effect of the permanently disability on the earning capacity
                  of the injured; and after assessing the loss of earning
                  capacity in terms of a percentage of the income, it has to be
                  quantified in terms of money, to arrive at the future loss of
                  earnings (by applying the standard multiplier method used
                  to determine loss of dependency). We may however note that
                  in some cases, on appreciation of evidence and assessment,
                  the Tribunal may find that percentage of loss of earning
                  capacity as a result of the permanent disability, is
                  approximately the same as the percentage of permanent
                  disability in which case, of course, the Tribunal will adopt
                  the said percentage for determination of compensation (see
                  for example, the decisions of this Court in Arvind Kumar
                  Mishra v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. 2010 (10) SCC 254
                  and Yadava Kumar v. D.M., National Insurance Co. Ltd.
                  2010 (10) SCC 341.

                  14. For example, if the left hand of a claimant is
                  amputated, the permanent physical or functional
                  disablement may be assessed around 60%. If the claimant
                  was a driver or a carpenter, the actual loss of earning
                  capacity may virtually be hundred percent, if he is neither
                  able to drive or do carpentry. On the other hand, if the
                  claimant was a clerk in government service, the loss of his
                  left hand may not result in loss of employment and he may
                  still be continued as a clerk as he could perform his clerical
                  functions; and in that event the loss of earning capacity will
                  not be 100% as in the case of a driver or carpenter, nor
                  60% which is the actual physical disability, but far less. In
                  fact, there may not be any need to award any compensation
                  under the head of 'loss of future earnings', if the claimant
                  continues in government service, though he may be awarded
                  compensation under the head of loss of amenities as a
                  consequence of losing his hand. Sometimes the injured
                  claimant may be continued in service, but may not found
                  suitable for discharging the duties attached to the post or
                  job which he was earlier holding, on account of his
                  disability, and may therefore be shifted to some other
                  suitable but lesser post with lesser emoluments, in which
                  case there should be a limited award under the head of loss
                  of future earning capacity, taking note of the reduced
                  earning capacity.”
13.     In the absence of any expert evidence, I would take the loss of earning
        capacity as 50%. As per his own affidavit, the Appellant was aged 25
        years at the time of the accident. He was awarded a compensation of 18
        months towards loss of income.            Thus, compensation on account of
        earning capacity has to be granted taking his age as 26 years.             The
        Appellant was entitled to an addition of 30% on account of inflation
        while computing the loss of future earning capacity as per Santosh Devi
        v. National Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors., 2012 (4) SCALE 559. Thus,
MAC.APP. No.456/2009                                               Page 10 of 15

        the loss of earning capacity comes to `8,03,556/- (`3030/- + 30% x 12 x
        17) as against a sum of `4,63,080/- awarded by the Claims Tribunal.
ATTENDENT CHARGES:
14.     No expert evidence was produced to prove the need for attendant after the
        accident and at the time of surgery post the impugned judgment.
        Considering the nature of injuries suffered by the Appellant, it can be
        assumed that the Appellant was unable to carry out his day to day
        activities of going to the toilet, having a bath and doing other essential
        things of his own at the most for a period of eight months including one
        month after the award.       The minimum wages of an unskilled worker at
        the time of the accident were `2579/-. The Appellant proved the receipt
        Mark AW1/29 to AW1/32 to show that one Mohd. Ahmed was employed
        for a period of four months as an attendant at a salary of `3200/- per
        month.        Said Mohd. Ahmed was not produced. I am, therefore, not
        inclined to believe that Mohd. Ahmed was employed by the Appellant.
        In any case, even if gratuitous services were rendered by a family
        member, the Appellant cannot be denied compensation for the same.
15.     In Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr. v. Lalita, AIR 1981 Delhi 558, a
        Division Bench of this Court held that there cannot be deduction if
        domestic help is obtained from a family member. The relevant para of
        the report is extracted hereunder:-
                  “…….A wrong doer cannot take advantage of this „domestic
                  element‟. If the mother renders service to her, instead of a
                  nurse, it is right and just that she should recover
                  compensation for the value of the services that the mother
                  has rendered to her. Mother‟s services were necessitated by
                  the wrong doing and the injured should be compensated for
                  it. (Cunnigharn v. Harrison 3 All E.R. 463) The services of
MAC.APP. No.456/2009                                             Page 11 of 15

                  a wife and mother are worth more than those of a house-
                  keeper because she is in constant attendance and does many
                  more things than a house-keeper. (Regan v. Williamson
                  (1976) 2 All E.R. 241).”
        Thus, the compensation of `20,000/- awarded under this head is just and
        reasonable.
FUTURE TREATMENT:
16.     The Appellant examined AW2 Dr. Anmol Maria from Primus Hospital to
        prove the corrective surgery underwent by the Appellant in Primus
        Hospital. He proved the documents Mark AW1/1 to AW1/28 in respect
        of the expenditure incurred by him including the bill Mark AW1/15 for
        `82,705/-. This totals to `1,27,077/-. From the record, it appears that the
        Appellant had taken a twin sharing room.           AW2 Dr. Anmol Maria
        admitted that the cost of an economy ward in Primus Hospital is much
        cheaper than a twin sharing room. But, a twin sharing room cannot be
        said to be a luxury accommodation. Moreover, no evidence in rebuttal
        was brought by the Respondent DTC that an economy ward was available
        in the Hospital. The Respondent DTC has not been able to produce any
        evidence to doubt the expenditure on the treatment taken in Primus
        Hospital.       Accordingly, I grant a sum of `1,28,000/- towards the
        treatment received during the pendency of the Appeal.
17.     AW2 Dr. Anmol Maria also gave estimate for second and third stage of
        the corrective surgery which would involve an expenditure of `
        2,75,000/-. In view of the expert evidence of Dr. Anmol Maria, I see no
        reason to disbelieve the same and hold that the Appellant is entitled to a
        sum of ` 2,75,000/- towards future treatment.

18.     In the case of Govind Yadav v. New India Insurance Co. Ltd., (2011) 10
        SCC 683, the Supreme Court relied on R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control
        (India) (P) Ltd., 1995 (1) SCC 551, Nizam‟s Institute of Medical
        Sciences, Arvind Kumar Mishra and Raj Kumar and granted a
        compensation of `3,00,000/- under non-pecuniary heads in case of
        amputation of a leg of a young boy aged 24 years.             It is difficult to
        measure in terms of money the pain and suffering which is suffered by
        the claimant on account of serious injuries caused to him in a motor
        accident. Since the compensation is required to be paid for pain and
        suffering an attempt must be made to award compensation which may
        have some objective relation with the pain and suffering underwent by
        the victim of a motor accident. For this purpose, the Claims Tribunal and
        the Courts normally consider the nature of injury; the parts of the body
        where the injuries were sustained; surgeries (if any) underwent by the
        victim; confinement in the hospital and the duration of the treatment.
19.     The Appellant underwent successful surgeries in the year 2001, 2003 and
        2009. He would need another surgery as stated hereinabove. In the
        circumstances, award of `50,000/- towards pain and suffering was on the
        lower side. The same is enhanced to `1,50,000/- in consonance with
        Govind Yadav.      As far as award of compensation of `50,000/- each
        towards physical disfigurement and loss of amenities of life (totaling to
        `1,00,000/- ) is concerned, the Appellant’s disability is lower than the one
        suffered by the victim in Govind Yadav. The same is accordingly not
        interfered with.
20.     The award of compensation of `25,000/- towards conveyance and special
        diet also seems to be just and reasonable in the absence of any specific
        evidence with regard to the actual expenditure under this head.

22.     Thus, there is an overall enhancement of `8,98,016/- in the compensation
        awarded. The enhanced compensation of `4,95,016/- shall carry interest
        @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the Petition till its payment.
        An enhancement of `4,03,000/- has been awarded in respect of the
        treatment received by him in the year 2009 and the treatment which is yet

        to be received. The Appellant would be entitled to interest @ 7.5% per
        annum on this sum from 01.08.2009 till its payment. The compensation
        of `2,75,000/- shall be held in fixed deposit in UCO Bank, Delhi High
        Court Branch for a period of one year and shall be released to the
        Appellant at the time of the second and third stage of surgery. Rest of the
        enhanced compensation shall be released on deposit.             The enhanced
        compensation along with interest shall be deposited by the Respondent
        No.2 Delhi Transport Corporation with the UCO Bank, Delhi High Court
