            For the Petitioners:                 Mr. M. Khan,

                                     JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)
                    Heard Mr. M. Khan, the learned counsel for the petitioner. The
            respondents are represented by Mr. N. Sarma, the learned standing counsel for
            the Department of Elementary Education.
WP(C) 5040/2010                                                                    Page 1 of 4

            2.       The petitioner is the Headmaster of the Rabidaspara Harijan M.V. School in
            Cachar district and the challenge here is to the order dated 12.08.2010
            (Annexure-7), whereby the penalty of dropping one annual increment was
            imposed on the delinquent under Rule 7 of the Assam Services (Discipline and
            Appeal) Rules, 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the “Discipline Rules”). Under the
            same order, the Headmaster suspended on 07.07.2009 (Annexure-3), was
            reinstated, to his original post.
            3.1      Assailing the impugned penalty, Mr. M. Khan, the learned counsel submits
            that departmental enquiry was never conducted into the charge and thus no
            opportunity was afforded to the delinquent. On this basis, it is argued that the
            penalty was imposed in contravention of the procedure prescribed by Rule 9 of
            the Discipline Rules.
            3.2      The petitioner contends that charges were not framed and enquiry was
            never conducted to facilitate the delinquent to defend the charges and accordingly
            it is argued that the petitioner was penalised without the opportunity to rebut the
            charges.
            4.       Pending drawal of departmental proceedings, the Headmaster of the M.V.
            School was placed under suspension on 07.07.2009 (Annexure-3) on the
            allegation that the delinquent did not allow the joining of the appointees, Fakrul
            Islam Laskar and Baharul Haque Laskar, in wilful subordination of the orders of his
            superiors. An appeal was filed by the delinquent against the suspension order and
            this Court on 03.08.2009 (Annexure-4) in the WP(C) No.3117/2009 had directed
            the authorities to decide the pending appeal dated 15.07.2009. Thereafter the
            speaking order was passed on 17.12.2009 (Annexure-5), whereby, the appeal was
            rejected by the Government and the DEE, Assam was directed to draw up the
            Departmental Proceeding, against the delinquent.
            5.       Thereafter the show-cause notice dated 01.06.2010 was issued under Rule
            9 of the Discipline Rules proposing to inflict the penalties prescribed in Rule 7 of
            the Rules. The statement of allegation being relevant, is extracted herein below
            for ready reference:-
WP(C) 5040/2010                                                                        Page 2 of 4

                     “While Sri Jamal Uddin Laskar was serving as Head Master of Rabidaspara
                     Harizon MV School, he defied as well as non-complied with the order of the
                     Director of Elementary Education, Assam, Kahilipara, Guwahati-09 in respect of
                     allowing joining 2(two) new appointees viz. Sri Fakrul Islam Laskar and Sri
                     Baharul Haque Laskar against the appointment letters issued vide orders Memo
                     No.EMA 63/2005/107 dt. 25/06/09 and EAA 135/2005/81 dt. 25/06/09
                     respectively.
                     Therefore, he is charged with defying as well as non-complying the order of the
                     authorities with malafide intention for his personal gain.”
            6.       The delinquent gave his reply but the disciplinary authority appointed the
            DEEO, Cachar as the Enquiry Officer in the proceeding. But it appears that no
            departmental enquiry was ever conducted. But nevertheless, the Enquiry Officer
            gave a report to the DEE on 27.07.2010 to the effect that the enquiry was
            concluded and the delinquent was found guilty of the charges.
            7.      However what emerges from the enquiry report annexed to the counter
            affidavit filed by the DEE, Assam is that, conclusions were drawn only on the basis
            of the response given by the delinquent to the show-cause notice dated
            01.06.2010 but formal enquiry was never conducted into the charges. In fact, the
            impugned punishment order dated 12.08.2010 also, does not refer to any enquiry
            finding.
            8.       When any of the penalties specified in Rule 7 of the Discipline Rules are to
            be inflicted, the procedure for imposing penalties, are laid down in Rule 9 of the
            Discipline Rules. But the elaborate procedure for conducting the enquiry
            prescribed by Rule 9, was wholly overlooked by the authority. Thus this is a clear
            case of the delinquent being penalised, without adherence to the procedure laid
            down in the Discipline Rules.
            9.      That apart, since opportunity was denied to the delinquent, it is a clear
            case of the breach of the principles of natural justice.
            10.     It is well settled that penal action must not be taken without affording
            hearing to the affected party, but here the authorities have failed to adhere to the
            procedure prescribed by Rule 9 of the Discipline Rules and also denied due
            opportunity to the Headmaster. Thus I am of the considered opinion that
WP(C) 5040/2010                                                                          Page 3 of 4

            penalisation of the delinquent under the impugned order dated 12.08.2010
            (Annexure-7), is legally unsustainable.
            11.    Following the above conclusion, the impugned penalty of dropping one
            annual increment against the delinquent is set aside and quashed. Thus all
            consequent reliefs are granted to the petitioner.
            12.    The writ petition is accordingly allowed with the above order. No cost.
                                                                                  JUDGE
