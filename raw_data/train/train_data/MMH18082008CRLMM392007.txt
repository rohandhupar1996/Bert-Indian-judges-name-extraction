CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANMOHAN
1. Whether Reporters of local papers may
   be allowed to see the judgment?
2. To be referred to the Reporter or not?
3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the digest?
                           JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J: (ORAL)
1.     The present petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure for quashing an FIR No. 401/2002 registered with P.S.
Sarai Rohilla under Sections 380 and 411 IPC as well as the proceedings
arising therefrom and now pending in the Court of Shri Vidya Prakash, MM,
New Delhi.
                                                                      Page 1 of 2

2.     The ground on which quashing is sought is that the matter has been
amicably resolved between the complainant/respondent No. 1 and the
petitioner. Not only is the present petition accompanied by an affidavit of
respondent No. 1/complainant but a compromise deed between the parties
has also been placed on reocrd. In fact, respondent No. 1, who is present in
Court and who has been identified by the IO, states that she has no objection
if the FIR filed by her is quashed.
3.     Since the matter has been amicably resolved between the parties and
the entire case revolves around the statement of respondent No. 1, I see no
purpose in continuing the present proceedings.
4.     Accordingly, FIR No. 401/2002 registered with P.S. Sarai Rohilla
under Sections 380 and 411 IPC as well as the proceedings arising therefrom
and now pending in the Court of Shri Vidya Prakash, MM, New Delhi are
quashed.
5.     The present petition stands disposed in the above terms
6.     Dasti.
