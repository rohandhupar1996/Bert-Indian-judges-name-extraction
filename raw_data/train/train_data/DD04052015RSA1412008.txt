_________________________________________________________________
                 The unsuccessful plaintiff in the trial court has filed this
appeal challenging the judgment and decree passed by the learned District
Judge, Kandhamal in R.F.A. No. 21 of 2003 confirming the judgment and
decree passed by the Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Baliguda in Title Suit No.
61 of 2001.
2.               For the sake of convenience, in order to avoid confusion and
bring clarity, the parties hereinafter have been referred to as they have
been arrayed in the court below.
3.               Facts necessary for the purpose are as follows:-

                                       // 2 //
              The appellant as the plaintiff filed the suit against the State of
Odisha and other officials of the State with the prayer for declaration of
his right, title, interest and possession and other reliefs reasoned to
correction of record of right imposition of cost etc.
              The plaintiff’s case is that, he being the member of Scheduled
Tribe being ‘Kandha’ by caste has been residing over the suit land
measuring HC 0.376 R by constructing a residential house since long. It is
stated that the suit land has actually been in physical possession of the
plaintiff since time of his fore-fathers. It is further specifically stated that
the said land is the ancestral property which he asserts to be his positive
case. During settlement operation, a parcha was issued in his favour in
respect of the suit land but at the time of final publication of the ROR
recorded in the name of the State in the Anabadi Khata. So, encroachment
case No. 04 of 1985 was initiated under the provision of OPLE Act.
Ultimately in that proceeding, the land was settled and the plaintiff was
issued with ROR. But later on, an appeal being preferred against the said
order after a long lapse time claiming that the settlement of the suit land
in favour of the plaintiff to be illegal, the order of settlement of the suit
land in the name of the plaintiff has been set aside resulting the
cancellation of record of right standing in the name of the plaintiff.
Thereafter, when an eviction proceeding was initiated against the plaintiff,
apprehending this dispossession, he filed this suit.

                                        // 3 //
                The defendant’s case as projected in the written statement is
that the suit land is not the ancestral property of the plaintiff and the
possession of the suit land to be remaining exclusively in the hands of the
plaintiff and his fore-fathers prior to that is denied. They admit that
ultimately in the encroachment case, there was an order of settlement of
the suit land is in favour of the plaintiff under sub-section (1) section 8(A)
of the Act but when later on, it was detected that said order of settlement
is illegal, it has been annulled.
                In view of above, they prayed to non-suit the plaintiff.
4.              On such rival pleadings, the trial court framed seven issues
and appears to have been rightly taken issue no. 4 and 5 with regard to
claim of the plaintiff that the suit land is ancestral property and also the
claim of acquisition of title of adverse possession.
                Upon evaluation of evidence in the touchstone of the position
of law as discussed by the trial court, the finding has been rendered
against the plaintiff. Answers to the other issues have practically followed
the same path being almost consequential.
5.              The lower appellate court has gone for re-appraisal of the
evidence as the final court of fact in order to examine the defensibility of
the finding of the trial court on Issue Nos. 3, 4 & 5. It has finally
concurred with the trial court. The appeal has been admitted on the
following substantial questions of law:-

                                      // 4 //
                            “Whether the learned courts below have
                   committed an error of law is not holding that the
                   appellant perfected his title by way of adverse
                   possession,     even     though such   perfection    by
                   adverse possession was admitted by the authorities
                   of the State on the basis of which, the land was
                   initially settled with the plaintiff, pursuant to the
                   order passed in Encroachment Case No. 04 of
                   1985, which was exhibited as Exts. 3/e, 3/f &
                   3/g?”
6.           Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the courts
below have completely erred in law by going to hold with the plaintiff has
not acquired title over the suit land by adverse possession. According to
him, in E.C. Case No. 04 of 1985, the suit land having been settled with
the plaintiff on that basis of long, continuous and un-interrupted
possession of the suit land, the courts below ought not to have traveled
beyond that to render a finding in respect of title over the suit land.
7.           Learned counsel for the State submits in support of the
finding rendered by the courts below that the plaintiff has not acquired
title over the suit land by adverse possession.        According to him, the
earlier order of settlement of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff is
nonest in the eye of law. The settlement was also without any authority of
law and therefore, it has been rightly revised followed by correction of the
ROR and that having not been challenged, in this suit the final order of
cancellation has to be viewed as holding the field.

                                      // 5 //
8.            In a general way, it has been stated that the plaintiff is in
possession that the suit land since time immemorial from the time of his
ancestor. It is stated that it is ancestral property. However, no document
has been proved in that regard. So, both the courts below have found the
suit property to be not the property of the ancestor of the plaintiff. Now
also that question looses all its significance, when admittedly the plaintiff
by the so called order of settlement by the authority under OPLE Act, has
accepted the decision and has paid rent for the same. The final order of
settlement is dated 30.04.1990 Ext. 3(g) followed by the ROR Ext. 1. The
settlement appears to have been made on the basis of local inquiry
conducted by the Tahasildar. It reveals from the order sheets dated
10.09.1989 Ext. 3(d) that the Tahasildar found the property in the hands
of the plaintiff to be is paternal property and it has been pleaded on behalf
of the plaintiff that he could get no Patta in the last settlement operation
and that he is illiterate and member of Schedule Tribe Community. So, he
has ultimately recorded the following satisfaction:-
                “I am satisfied with the case land his ancestral property of
       the encroacher and it is concluded by adverse possession for more
       than 30 years.” (Quoted in verbatim)
              The two sentences as above are inter se contradictory. When
in the first breath, it is stated that the property is the ancestral property;
in the next, it is stated that the title over the property has been acquired
by adverse possession by remaining in possession for upward of 30 years.

                                     // 6 //
9.           The provisions of section 8(A) of the OPLE Act do not
authorize settlement of land on such findings as had been done in the
present case. This order cannot be taken as amounting to admission of
the claim of acquisition of title by adverse possession. So, said order in
Encroachment Case No. 04 of 1985 does not come to the aid and
assistance of the plaintiff so far as his claim of acquisition of title over the
suit land by adverse possession is concerned and he is to plead and prove
all those required ingredients of the said claim in the suit, so as to sustain
in his claim. Furthermore, both the courts below upon evaluation of the
evidence have factually held about the non-establishment of all the legal
requirements for success of the claim of acquisition of title by the plaintiff
by adverse possession. The findings cannot be said to be perverse or
contrary to the evidence. When the authorities having no power at all to
deal with the matter in accordance with the provisions of OPLE Act, finally
have passed an order to that effect, the same is nonest and thus cannot
bind the State in saying that the case of the plaintiff as projected in the
plaint which was also then projected in the encroachment proceeding
stood admitted and proved. This Court also finds that the finding of the
courts below negating the claim of the plaintiff as regards acquisition of
title over the suit land by adverse possession is based on proper
appreciation of evidence and for the purpose, the courts below have not at
all taken into account any in-admissible evidence nor the conjectures or

                                           // 7 //
surmises have come to influence the finding. Nothing in that regard is
placed showing any perversity in the said finding.
                    The substantial questions of law formulated while admitting
the appeal is answered accordingly as per the discussions and reasons in
the foregoing paragraph.
10.                 In the result, the appeal stands dismissed and in the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the case without costs.
                                                   ……………………..
