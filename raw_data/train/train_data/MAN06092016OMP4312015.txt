R.P. No.154/2016 (review of order dated 18th February, 2016),
I.A. No.3624/2016 (for directions) & I.A. No.8936/2016 (for
taking settlement agreement on record), by respondent and
O.M.P. No.431/2015
1.      The petitioner has filed the present petition under Section 34 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as
the “Act”) for seeking setting aside of the Award dated 23rd March,
2015      passed    by  the    sole   Arbitrator   wherein      a     sum   of
Rs.19,02,47,938/- plus Rs.2,35,14,645/- as service tax with simple
interest @ 10% w.e.f. 13th April, 2012 to 23rd March, 2015 towards
claims No.1, 2 & 3 to the respondent was awarded.
2.      The said petition was filed first time in the Registry on 29th
June, 2015 when the Registry raised certain objections. Thereafter,
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                            Page 1 of 14

the petition was re-filed on 20th July, 2015. Along with the petition,
the petitioner also filed an application being I.A. No.16149/2015 for
condonation of delay of 5 days in re-filing the same.              The said
application was allowed by order dated 18th February, 2016.
3.      Subsequently, the respondent filed an application being I.A.
No.3624/2016 seeking prayer for issuance of directions to the
Registry to provide the details of the filing and re-filing of the petition
from time to time on behalf of the petitioner.      By order dated 18th
March, 2016, notice of the said application was issued to the
respondent and simultaneously, report of the Registry in a sealed
cover was also called. The respondent filed the review petition being
R.P. No.154/2016 under Section 114 read with Order XLVII Rule 1
and Section 151 CPC for review of the order dated 18 th February,
2016. The report from the Registry was received in a sealed cover by
the Joint Registrar. The parties were allowed to inspect the same and
an order in this regard was passed on 23rd May, 2016.
4.      Thereafter, the respondent filed an application being I.A.
No.8936/2016 for taking on record the Settlement Agreement entered
into between the parties as well as for dismissal of the petition in view
of the settlement.
5.      In case the prayer made in the application being I.A. No.
8936/2016        is allowed, the  other    two  applications,     i.e.  R.P.
No.154/2016 and I.A. No.3624/2016 would become infructuous and
there would be no need to pass any further orders in those
applications.
6.      It is contended by the respondent in the application being I.A.
No.8936/2016 that prior to filing of the objections, i.e. on 29th June,
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                         Page 2 of 14

2015, negotiations were going on between the parties to amicably
settle the matter in respect of the subject matter of the impugned
Award and after due deliberations and discussions, the petitioner
called upon the respondent to write a letter to the petitioner that the
terms of the settlement were acceptable to the respondent.                         The
respondent accordingly wrote a letter dated 29th June, 2015 to the
petitioner setting out the terms of the settlement which were
acceptable to the respondent.

8.      The petitioner after having considered the said letter of the
respondent accepted the said offer which was also approved by the
Board of Directors of the petitioner. It was only thereafter that the

Settlement Agreement dated 28th September, 2015 was entered into
and executed between the parties by accepting the Award and
modifying it to the extent as set out in the said agreement.           The
respondent has placed on record the correspondence exchanged
between the parties as well as the Settlement Agreement dated 28th
September, 2015.

10.     Prior to the above settlement, on 24th September, 2015 a letter
was issued by the petitioner to the respondent; the contents of the
said letter have been reproduced herein below:-
        “No.Plg/523/1.6/15/1420                            Dated 24.09.2015

        Dear Sir,
        We wish to invite your attention to the "Settlement Agreement”
        executed between AAI and ourselves on 28th Sept' 2015.
        We note with regret that even though one month has passed, the dues
        have yet not been settled. This is despite that matter has the prior
        approval of highest authority i.e. AAI Board. We will appreciate if an,
        early firm date, by which we should expect payment, is communicated
        to us.
        The next court-hearing is scheduled for 2nd Nov' 2015. Settlement of
        dues before above date would enable closure of the case.
        Please appreciate, that undue delay on the part of AAI is causing us
        considerable financial loss.
        Thanking you,

12.     When the matter was taken up on 2nd November, 2015, the fact
regarding the Settlement Agreement dated 28th September, 2015 was
brought to the notice of this Court and the copy of the said
Settlement Agreement produced by the respondent was taken on
record. On the next date i.e. 16th November, 2015 certain objections
to Settlement Agreement were raised on behalf of the petitioner. The
Court at that time directed the petitioner to file an affidavit in
response to the settlement.
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                                Page 7 of 14

13.     The petitioner thereafter filed an affidavit dated 11th December,
2015 wherein the fact regarding the Settlement Agreement having
been arrived at between the parties was accepted and admitted by
the petitioner, however, in paras 8, 9 and 10 of the affidavit, the
petitioner      gave    its  reasons   for   not    honouring     the    said
settlement.
14.     The said paras of the affidavit have been reproduced here as
under:-
        “8.     That disputes also arose between the Petitioner and
        M/s Virender Khanna & Associates pursuant to which the
        matter was referred to Shri P.K. Gupta, Sole Arbitrator to
        adjudicate upon the claims and counter claims of the
        Petitioner and M/s Virender Khanna & Associates.
        9.      That the Learned Sole Arbitrator in the proceedings
        between the Petitioner and M/s Virender Khanna &
        Associates passed an interim award dated 16.10.2015 on
        the issue of non-executing the subject Consultancy
        Agreement as per 110th Board meeting of the Petitioner i.e.
        Airports Authority of India. It is pertinent to state here
        that the Claim No.1 raised by the Respondent in the
        present Petition also involves the same issue. Hence, the
        Learned Sole Arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings
        between M/s Virender Khanna & Associates and Airports
        Authority of India has given a contrary finding to that given
        by the Learned Sole Arbitrator Sh. H.S. Dogra in the
        arbitration proceedings between the Petitioner and the
        Respondent herein. Copy of the interim award dated
        16.10.2015 is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure
        S-1.
        10. That after receipt of the interim award dated
        16.10.2015, the Competent Authority considered both the
        awards and has taken a decision not to implement the said
        Settlement Agreement entered into between the parties
        herein.”

15.     Mr.Rajiv Virmani, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of
the respondent submits that the respondent is not a party to the
arbitration proceedings between the petitioner and the third party
who was awarded the work for International Airport at Calcutta. It is
also submitted by Mr.Virmani that the stand now taken by the
petitioner had already been argued before the Arbitral Tribunal and
the said plea of the petitioner was rejected. He submits that despite
of having the full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances from
the year 2007, the Settlement Agreement between the parties is
arrived at after passing the proper resolution and the same is duly
signed by the parties after filing the objections under Section 34 of
the Act.      Therefore, there is no impediment of any nature not to
honour the Settlement Agreement by the petitioner. As the petitioner
is not honouring the same, the present objection petition is liable to
be dismissed and in case, the petitioner is ready to honour the same,
the said terms are binding upon the parties.
16.     Learned counsel for the respondent submits that the statement
made in the said paras 8 to 10 of the affidavit for not honouring the
settlement is totally untenable and the petitioner is bound to honour
the Settlement Agreement dated 28th September, 2015.
17.     Learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner
submits that the settlement agreement arrived can be implemented
however, he does not dispute the validity of execution of the
Settlement Agreement as well as the Resolution passed by the
petitioner for the purpose of settlement.    He also admitted the fact
that correspondences were exchanged between the parties prior to
execution of settlement. He also does not deny the terms and
conditions mentioned in the Settlement Agreement.           His line of
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                      Page 9 of 14

argument is the same as mentioned in paras 8 to 10 of the affidavit
filed by the petitioner. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner
admits that the respondent is not a party in the said pending
proceedings wherein M/s Virender Khanna & Associates have filed the
objections under Section 34 of the Act challenging the Award
published against them. However, he submits that once the Arbitral
Tribunal had passed the Award in favour of the petitioner, the
petitioner took a decision not to implement the said Settlement
Agreement executed between the parties. Under these circumstances,
he submits that the petitioner is not inclined to honour the said
Settlement Agreement dated 28th September, 2015.
18.     After having heard the learned counsel for the parties and
having considered the correspondences exchanged between the
parties, prior and after the settlement arrived at between them,
coupled with the Settlement Agreement itself, I am of the considered
view that the prayer made in the application being I.A. No.8936/2016
is liable to be allowed, for the following reasons:-
        (i)     Admittedly, the objections under Section 34 of the Act
                were filed by the petitioner in the Registry on 29 th June,
                2015.   There were negotiations between the parties for
                settlement.    Undisputedly, the correspondences were
                exchanged between the parties in this regard.       It is not
                denied by the petitioner that before the settlement, the
                Resolution was also passed by the petitioner.             The
                Settlement Agreement was duly signed by the parties.
                The factum of the same has not been denied.
        (ii)    Section 19 of the Indian Contract Act reads as under:-
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                          Page 10 of 14

                   “19. Voidability of agreements without free
                   consent.—When consent to an agreement is
                   caused by coercion, fraud or misrepresentation,
                   the agreement is a contract voidable at the option
                   of the party whose consent was so caused.
                   A party to contract, whose consent was caused by
                   fraud or misrepresentation, may, if he thinks fit,
                   insist that the contract shall be performed, and
                   that he shall be put in the position in which he
                   would have been if the representations made had
                   been true.
                   Exception.— If such consent was caused by
                   misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within
                   the meaning of section 17, the contract,
                   nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose
                   consent was so caused had the means of
                   discovering the truth with ordinary diligence.
                   Explanation.— A fraud or misrepresentation which
                   did not cause the consent to a contract of the party
                   on whom such fraud was practised, or to whom
                   such misrepresentation was made, does not render
                   a contract voidable.”
        (iii)   There is no allegation of fraud, coercion and mis-
                representation made by the petitioner that the Settlement
                Agreement is arrived under some pressure.           The mere
                allegation is that, in other arbitration proceedings where
                the Award has been passed in favour of the petitioner
                against the third party, the award rendered in the present
                case is against the petitioner. As the respondent was
                connected with the work given to third party also as
                amendment of the contract therefore, the petitioner is
                now ready to pay the settlement award.
        (iv)    With regard to the statements made in paras 8 and 9 of
                the affidavit filed by the petitioner as per order dated 2 nd
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                            Page 11 of 14

                November, 2015, the said aspect has been dealt with in
                the     impugned    Award    published   in   favour      of  the
                respondent. Para (iii) at page 13 and para (vi) at page 16
                of the Award dated 23rd March, 2015 are reproduced here
                as under:-
                   “(iii) The respondents in their document D-I have
                   contended that there was an inadvertent mistake
                   of fact in clause 2.2 of the agreement which upon
                   noticing was rectified vide their office letter dated
                   24th January 2011 correcting the entitlement to
                   5% professional fee of the estimated cost or
                   awarded cost whichever is lower. They further
                   submitted that the inadvertent mistake of fact and
                   correction thereof was in the light of the decision
                   of 10th board meeting held on 17.05.2007 of AAI
                   where in it was specifically resolved that the
                   consultant's fee of 5% shall be of estimated costs
                   or the awarded costs whichever is lower. The
                   respondent further stated that it is to be noted that
                   upto 5th stage of work the professional fee of 5% is
                   paid on rough estimate cost basis and for that
                   reason the inadvertent mistake could not be
                   detected. The Claimant is taking undue advantage
                   of mistake of fact in getting the said term
                   applicable as mistakenly typed in the agreement
                   dated 21st August 2007. The Claimant has already
                   been paid an excess fee of Rupees 3.79 crores
                   upto stage 6 (b) (ii). Therefore the claim of the
                   Claimant is untenable. This amount is also their
                   counter claim.”
                   x     x    x     x     x
                   (vi) After carefully going through all the documents
                   and records produced by the parties and hearing at
                   length both the parties, I have come to the
                   following conclusion. It is undisputed that clause
                   2.2 of the agreement between the parties clearly
                   stipulates that "In consideration of the professional
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                              Page 12 of 14

                   services rendered by the consultant, he shall be
                   paid a professional fee of 5% of the actual cost of
                   the work or the awarded cost whichever is lower of
                   the sub head of the works for which consultant has
                   rendered professional services". This contract was
                   entered into on 21st August 2007 whereas the
                   board meeting of AAI is stated to have been held
                   on 17th May 2007 i.e. nearly three months prior to
                   the signing of the agreement. Since the decision of
                   the board was well known to the respondents as
                   on the date of signing of this agreement, the
                   respondents could not explain or place before me
                   any documents or circumstances explaining as to
                   how this clause got written differently in the
                   contract document in the first place. Further a
                   careful study of the contract document reveals that
                   similar provisions (as at clause 2.2) are repeated
                   at least at two more places in the contract. At
                   clause 4.1, the contract states that "the fee
                   payable to the consultant shall be computed on the
                   actual cost of the works or the awarded cost
                   whichever is lower". Again at sub clause 4.l(vi)
                   relating to the payments at stage 6 and 7 it states
                   "on awarded cost or actual cost whichever is lower
                   of the packages specified in para 2.20 of Annexure
                   A". It therefore appears that the contract
                   document was framed with the clear intent and
                   understanding that the fee is to be paid on the
                   basis of lower of the awarded cost or the actual
                   cost since this aspect is reflected at least at three
                   different clauses in the contract document. This
                   therefore cannot be accepted as an inadvertent
                   error or a typing mistake as argued by the
                   Respondents.”
19.     It is evident that despite the petitioner was aware about all
these circumstances, still the petitioner willingly settled the disputes
with the respondent.          There was no pressure from any quarter to
settle the disputes with the respondent.              The intention of the
petitioner was thus bonafide.         It appears that after the Settlement
O.M.P. No.431/2015                                            Page 13 of 14

Agreement when the award was passed in favour of the petitioner,
the petitioner had changed its mind. Had the respondent was a party
in the said arbitration proceedings, the position would have been
different to some extent, however, now it is difficult for the petitioner
to change its cards. It is always open for the petitioner to record the
amount if any liabilities are fastened against the petitioner in other
proceedings of Section 34, although the respondent is not a party and
it is not proper to express any opinion in this regard.
20.     As far as the present petition is concerned, either the petitioner
should agree with the terms and conditions of the settlement within
the period of four weeks, otherwise, the objections of the petitioner
shall be treated as dismissed, as the award even otherwise is well
considered and does not suffer from any infirmity. Had the position
was otherwise, the petitioner ought not to have settled the disputes
with the respondent.
21.     The petition is accordingly disposed of so as the pending
applications.
22.     As far as the pending objections filed by M/s Virender Khanna &
Associates (who is a third party in the present case) are concerned,
the same would be decided as per its own merits without any
influence of my judgment, as the findings are mainly arrived on the
basis of settlement and such situation is not available in that case.
23.     No costs.
