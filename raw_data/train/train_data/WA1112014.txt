                                                             MC 918/14
                                BEFORE
           HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
              HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN

(Manojit Bhuyan,J)
        Heard Mr. N. Deka, learned counsel for the appellant. The
present appeal was admitted for final hearing on 05.06.2017, treating
service of notice on the sole respondent/writ petitioner as proper, as
effected through substituted mode by newspaper publication.
        This appeal is directed against the Order dated 11.12.2013
passed in WP(C) 1920/2012.
        Facts essentially to be noticed is that following the direction of
the Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal Nos. 953-968 of 2005 (LIC
of India v. D.V. Anil Kumar), the appellant Corporation had initiated a
recruitment exercise, as a one-time measure, for regularising the
services of all eligible temporary Class-IV employees, confined to such
employees who were working in LIC of India for more than five years
as on 18.01.2011 and who possessed the minimum eligibility
qualification and age as prescribed at the relevant time of their entry to
LICI. A Guideline to that effect was also issued by the LICI on
19.05.2011, followed by necessary Advertisement on 20.05.2011.
        The respondent/writ petitioner, by claiming himself to be a
temporary employee, had responded to the Advertisement. Aggrieved
on not being invited to appear in the limited eligibility test, he had
instituted the related writ petition i.e. WP(C) 1920/2012.

       The point for consideration is as to whether the respondent/writ
petitioner was eligible in terms of the Guideline dated 19.05.2011 and
the Advertisement dated 20.05.2011. From the available records it is
seen that the respondent/writ petitioner had worked as daily wager in
the Bongaigaon Branch Office of LICI from 15.03.1998 to 16.03.2010.
There is a certificate issued by the Senior Branch Manager of the
Bongaigaon Branch Office indicating the aforesaid period during which
the respondent/writ petitioner discharged duties as a daily wager. The
said Certificate, however, do not go to indicate that the respondent/writ
petitioner was in service of LICI as a temporary employee as on
18.01.2011. In other words, although the respondent/writ petitioner
may have worked for more than five years until 18.01.2011, there is
nothing to show that he was an in-service employee of LICI on the cut-
off date i.e. 18.01.2011.
       The fact that the benefit of the Circular/Guideline cannot be
extended to those temporary employees who ceased to be in service
prior to 18.01.2011, although they may have completed five years of
service, was duly taken note of by the learned Single Judge. It cannot
be said that the respondent/writ petitioner was an in-service temporary
employee of LICI as on 18.01.2011. To reiterate, he ceased to be in
service of LICI on and from 16.03.2010. This being the admitted
position, the direction issued by the learned Single Judge to the
authority of LICI for considering the candidature of the respondent/writ
petitioner against the four vacancies in existence in the Divisional Office
at Bongaigaon cannot be sustained. To hold it otherwise would only
amount to giving undue advantage and licence to the ineligible and
undeserving persons not fulfilling the essential criteria as prescribed in
the Guideline dated 19.05.2011 and/or the Advertisement dated
20.05.2011.

      In view of the above, this writ appeal stands allowed by setting
aside the order and direction dated 11.12.2013 passed in WP(C)
1920/2012. No costs.
