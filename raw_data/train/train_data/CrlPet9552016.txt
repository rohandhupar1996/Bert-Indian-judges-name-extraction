                              Crl. Pet. No. 955 of 2016
                                           BEFORE
                  HONâ€™BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
13.07.2017
             Heard Ms. U. Hazarika, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. TK
    Mishra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam appearing for the State
    respondent.
             The petitioner No.1, as informant, on 29.06.2013 lodged an FIR against the
    petitioner No.2 before the Officer-in-Charge, Fatasil Ambari Police Station stating
    that she lives with her lone son and the accused/petitioner No.2 used to reside as
    her tenant, who was in the catering business. In the said FIR, the informant/
    petitioner No.1 also stated that her son is working with the accused/petitioner No.2
    in his catering business and the accused did not pay him salary for the last three
    months and, moreover, demanded Rs. 10 Lakhs from her and rather wants to
    possess her landed property by fraudulent means. The said FIR of the informant
    dated 29.06.2013 was duly registered as Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 401/2013
    under Sections 387 IPC (corresponding to GR No. 7860/2013). After completion of
    the investigation the concerned Investigating Officer, on 20.08.2013 vide No.
    165/2013, submitted the Chargesheet in the said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No.
    401/2013. The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kamrup (M), Guwahati after
    considering the said Chargesheet, by his order dated 01.10.2015 passed in GR Case
    No. 7860/2013, took cognizance of the offences and framed charges under Section
    389 IPC against the accused/petitioner No.2, which was read over and explained to
    him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
             During pendency of the case, the informant/petitioner No.1 and the
    accused/petitioner No. 2 amicably settled their dispute outside the court and to that
    extent, also made an agreement before the Notary at Guwahati on 01.06.2016
    wherein the informant/petitioner No.1 as 1st Party categorically submitted that as
    the matter has been settled outside the court to their satisfaction and the disputes
    between them had been compromised mutually, she does not want to pursue the
    Crl. Ptn. No. 955 of 2016                                               Page 1 of 2

proceeding of said GR Case No. 7860/2013 arising out of Fatasil Ambari PS case
No. 401/2013 since both the parties have agreed that they shall not create any
trouble to each other by any means in future and further, the accused/petitioner
No.2 is also suffering from acute liver disease.
         Both the informant/petitioner No.1 and the accused/petitioner No.2
appeared before the Court and the informant/petitioner No.1 submitted that
without any threat or intimidation she has amicably settled the dispute with the
accused/petitioner No.2 and she is no longer interested with the proceeding of said
GR Case No. 7860/2013 against the accused/petitioner No.2, who is suffering from
liver cancer.
         Considering the above submission of the learned counsel for the
complainant and the accused i.e. both the petitioners, the Court is of the view that
if the said proceeding pertaining to GR Case No. 7860/2013 is allowed to continue
against the accused/petitioner No.2, it would be an abuse of the process of the
Court as the parties have already settled the disputes towards their final
satisfaction, more particularly, the informant/petitioner No.1.
         As such, for the ends of justice, the proceeding of the GR Case No.
7860/2013 arising out of Fatasil Ambari PS case No. 401/2013, now pending before
the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kamrup (M), Guwahati is hereby set
aside and quashed. Consequently, the FIR dated 29.06.2013 lodged by the
informant/petitioner No.1 pertaining to said Fatasil Ambari PS case No. 401/2013 is
also set aside and quashed.
         This criminal petition is accordingly allowed.
                                                                JUDGE
