                                Crl. Pet. No. 205 of 2015
                                            BEFORE
                  HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
13.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Rupjit Dey, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr. BB Gogoi,
    learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam appearing for the State respondent
    No.1.
             Notice on the respondent No. 2 was duly served by publishing the same
    notice in two dailies, namely, the English daily “The Assam Tribune” and the
    Assamese Daily “Dainik Assam”, both dated 01.08.2015. Inspite of that, the
    respondent No. 2 did not enter appearance in the matter and, as such, the matter
    proceeded ex-parte against the said respondent.
             Petitioner No. 1 is a duly registered company having its head office at
    Chennai, Tamil Nadu and it has one of its branch office at Guwahati. The said
    petitioner No. 1 is duly represented by its Branch Officer, respondent No. 2. The
    petitioner No. 1 company amongst other facilities provides loan for purchasing
    vehicles under loan agreements to prospective purchasers. The respondent No.2
    availed such loan facility from the petitioner No. 1 company and purchased a TATA
    207 DI vehicle bearing registration No. AS-01-DC-8846 with chassis No.
    MAT478012B9FI8266 and Engine No. 497SP38FYY628652 by entering into a loan
    agreement dated 01.07.2011 with the petitioner No. 1 company for an amount of
    Rs. 3,80,000/- which he was required to return with interests         in 46 equated
    monthly installment of Rs. 11,122/- w.e.f. 01.07.2011 to 01.04.2015 and
    accordingly the said vehicle was hypothecated in the name of petitioner No. 1
    company as its financier. The Respondent No. 2 defaulted in making payment of
    the installments.
             However, the said TATA 207 DI vehicle No. AS-01-DC-8846 was seized by
    police in connection with Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 188/2012 on the basis of an
    FIR lodged by one Sankar Debnath on 09.04.2012. The petitioners on coming to
    know about the said seizure of the vehicle by Fatasil Ambari Police approached the
    Crl. Ptn. No. 205 of 2015                                                Page 1 of 4

Court of learned CJM, Kamrup (M) at Guwahati by filing an application under
Section 451/457 of the CrPC praying for custody of the said vehicle stating that the
petitioner company is the financier of the said vehicle and that the respondent No.
2 defaulted in making payment of the monthly installments and that the vehicle is
under hypothecation of the petitioner No. 1 company and further, the registration
certificate is also in favour of the petitioner No. 1 company. The learned CJM,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati on perusal of the report dated 23.08.2012 that he sought
for from the Officer-in-Charge of Fatasil Ambari Police Station, by his order dated
23.08.2012 passed in said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 188/2012, granted custody
of said TATA DI Vehicle No. AS-01-DC-8846 to the petitioner company on execution
of a bond of Rs. 10 Lakh. Accordingly, the petitioner No.1 Company executed the
necessary bond and took the said vehicle in its possession.
         To maintain the said TATA DI vehicle since the petitioner No. 1 company
had to incur huge expenses, as such, it on 14.7.2014, filed an application being
Petition No. 3744, under Section 451 of the CrPC before the CJM, Kamrup (M) at
Guwahati in said Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 188/2012, praying for disposal/sale
of said TATA DI Vehicle No. AS-01-DC-8846 stating that the vehicle is lying idle
with the petitioner No.1 company and is deteriorating day by day and the said
company had to pay near about Rs. 50,000/- towards parking expenses alone till
the date of filing of said application and that in the meanwhile, the respondent No.
2 had stopped making payment of outstanding installments.
         Submitting the same, the petitioner company prayed before the learned
Magistrate that they should be allowed to sell the vehicle through auction process
and to regain the money. However, the said application of the petitioner was
rejected by the Special Judicial Magistrate, Guwahati on 11.02.2015 observing that
the connected criminal case being Fatasil Ambari P.S. Case No. 188/2012 is still in
the investigation stage and, as such, during the said stage whether the vehicle
involved in that case is connected or not cannot be determined and moreover, the
petitioner has failed to trace out the address of the respondent No.2.
         Being aggrieved with the said order of the learned Special Judicial
Magistrate dated 11.02.2015, the petitioner has preferred this criminal petition.
Crl. Ptn. No. 205 of 2015                                                Page 2 of 4

         Heard the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties.
         It is settled that the object and scheme of the various provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure appears to be that where the property which has been
the subject matter of an offence is seized by the police, it ought not to be retained
in the custody of the Court or of the police for any time longer than what is
absolutely necessary and that production before the court does not mean physical
custody or possession by the court, but includes even control exercised by the
court by passing an order regarding the custody of the article. Chapter XXXIV of
the CrPC relates to disposal of property containing Sections 451 to 459. Section 451
of the CrPC relates to order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in
certain cases and it reads as follows:
         451. Order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain
         cases.—When any property is produced before any Criminal Court during an
         inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the proper
         custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the
         property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so
         to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it thinks necessary, order
         it to be sold or otherwise disposed of.
              Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “property” includes—
              (a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the Court or
         which is in its custody.
              (b) any property regarding which an offence appears to have been committed
         or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence.
         The Hon’ble Apex Court in a catena of decisions have held that power under
Section 451 should be exercised expeditiously and judiciously and it would serve
various purposes, amongst others, the owner of the article would not suffer
because of its remaining unused or by its misappropriation. (AIR 2003 SC 638).
         In the present case, though custody of the vehicle in question has been
given to the petitioner No.1 company, it is decaying day by day as not being used
by the company itself as it consists of mechanical and rubber parts and are subject
to natural decay and the said vehicle is of no use to the petitioner No.1 company
and is lying idle likely to be reduced to a junk soon and the sale of the vehicle
would benefit its owner, the petitioner No.1 company, as it would be able to
recover part of the loan advanced by it.
Crl. Ptn. No. 205 of 2015                                                       Page 3 of 4

         In a similar nature of case relating to a bus, which was financed by the
petitioner, this court in the case of Indusind Bank Ltd. & Anr -Vs- State of Assam &
others reported in 2014 (3) GLT 311, observed that –
         “the bus is lying in the custody of the bank for last more than one year and if any
         further delay is caused to dispose of the vehicle, it will gradually become scrap
         due to regular depreciation of the property. Even otherwise, the Investigating
         Officer must have made sufficient progress in the investigation of the case and
         physical production of the bus in the court may not be necessary and the
         identification of the bus may be proved through photograph and other documents
         and accordingly, allowed the said petitioner bank to dispose of the bus by way of
         auction with due intimation to the concerned CJM directing the said petitioner
         Bank to give an account of the sale proceeds to the court.”
         In the present case also, if said TATA 207 DI Vehicle No. AS-01-DC-8846 is
not allowed to be disposed of by its financier, the petitioner No.1 company who is
in custody of the vehicle, it will also become a junk and a scrap within a short
period. As the Fatasil Ambari P.S. case relates to the year 2012, probably the
investigation of the same is complete by this time. Moreover, the Investigating
Officer of Fatasil Ambari PS Case No. 188/2012 may take necessary photograph or
videograph of the said vehicle in question involved in said Fatasil Ambari Case No.
188/2012 for its proper identification, if it so desires for the purpose of necessary
investigation of the case.
         Considering the above, the impugned order dated 11.2.2015 passed by the
learned Special Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup, Guwahati in Petition No. 3744 dated
14.7.2014 filed by the petitioner No.1 company in said Fatasil Ambari PS Case No.
188/2012 is hereby set aside and quashed and the petitioner No. 1 company is
allowed to dispose of the said vehicle TATA 207 DI vehicle bearing registration No.
AS-01-DC -8846 by way of auction sale with due intimation to the CJM, Kamrup
(M), Guwahati in said Fatasil Ambari P.S Case No. 188/2012 and to give an account
of the sale proceeds of the said vehicle to the said Court after disposal of the
vehicle through auction process.
         With the aforesaid observation and direction, this criminal petition stands
allowed.
                                                                           JUDGE
