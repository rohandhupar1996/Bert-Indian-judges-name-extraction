                  Advocate for the appellant        : Mr. P Gogoi, Mr. A Khanikar, Advocate.
                  Advocate for Respondent            : Mr. BJ Dutta, Addl. P.P.
                   Date of hearing Judgment & Order ::            28th of July, 2017.
                                JUDGMENT & ORDER (oral)
                  This appeal, under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
       is directed against the judgment and order dated 31-08-2008, passed by
       the learned Sessions Judge, Dhemaji, in Sessions Case No. 72(DH)/2006,
       convicting the accused-appellant under Section 436 of the IPC and
       sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and to pay a
       fine of Rs. 1,000/-, in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2
       months.
       2.         None appears for the appellant. However, heard Mr. BJ Dutta,
       learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam. I have perused the
       impugned judgment of the learned trial Court including the evidence on
       record.
       Crl. A. No. 104 of 2008                                                        Page 1 of 4

3.         The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 09-05-2006, the accused-
appellant set fire in the rice mill of the informant, situated at Sirampuria
Chariali, causing damage to his rice mill along with the rice godown
belonging to one Kameswar Pegu.
4.         On receipt of the FIR, Jonai Police Station registered a case, being
No. 61/2006, under Section 436 of the IPC, investigated into it, collected
evidence and, finally, submitted the charge-sheet against the accused-
appellant for commission of an offence, under Section 436 of the IPC.
5.         Learned trial Court of Sessions Judge, Dhemaji framed formal
charge under Section 436 of the IPC against the accused-appellant, to
which the accused-appellant pleaded innocence.
6.         The prosecution examined as many as 8 witnesses, the defence
examined none. The defence plea is of denial. In his statement, recorded
under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused-appellant was found to have
denied the accusation levelled against him.
7.         The informant/PW1, in his evidence, exhibited in the FIR to have
been lodged by him alleging that the accused-appellant set in fire his rice
mill alongwith the adjacent godown, owned by one Kameswar Pegu.
8.         As against the assertive evidence of PW1/informant, there is
nothing in his cross-examination to discredit his version except the
suggestions, which have no evidentiary value unless the same is proved
through defence evidence or discredited in cross-examination. The PW1 is
a resported witness. He was reported by the PW2.
9.         The evidence of PW2 is very important in the sense that he
witnessed the accused-appellant setting fire in the rice mill of the
informant by lighting a match stick. He has corroborated the evidence of
PW1/informant regarding setting fire of the rice mill including the godown
by the accused-appellant. Such evidence of PW2 appears to have
Crl. A. No. 104 of 2008                                             Page 2 of 4

remained unshaken even during his cross-examination. A few omissions
have been brought in during the cross-examination, like that he did not
inform the police about the reporting of occurrence to PW1/informant.
The omission, such as the above, as brought in his evidence, does not
appear to be so material, demolishing the very root of the case. He
deposed that he reported the occurrence to the PW1 and as such to that
effect also the PW2 and PW1 corroborated each other.
10.        PW3 also deposed that he saw the accused-appellant setting fire of
the rice mill of the informant. He could not be discredited by way of
cross-examination and his evidence remained unshaken.
11.        PW4 saw the rice mill burning when he came out of his house and
he was reported by PW2 that the accused-appellant set in fire the rice
mill.
12.        PW5 is the brother of the informant/PW1 and he has no
independent knowledge of the occurrence.
13.        PW6 saw the burning of the rice mill after the occurrence and he
was reported by PW2 that the accused-appellant was involved in setting
in fire the rice mill of the PW1/informant.
14.        PW7 was also informed about the setting in fire in the rice mill of
the informant by PW2 only.
15.        PW8 is the Investigating Officer. On the basis of the evidence
collected from the remaining 7 witnesses, he finally submitted charge
sheet. During investigation, he seized the articles, as per the seizure list,
vide Ext. 2. The defence failed to elicit any such contradiction or omission
from him with reference to the evidence of the material witness, i.e.,
PW2, PW3, PW4 and PW5, so far as the occurrence is concerned and
involvement of the accused therein.
Crl. A. No. 104 of 2008                                           Page 3 of 4

16.        The evidence of PW2 and PW3 are most relevant in this case. PW2
being the eye witness of the accused setting in fire the rice mill. PW3 and
PW4 appeared at the place of occurrence immediately after lighting the
match stick in the rice mill by the accused-appellant. Except PW2 and
PW3, the other witnesses were reported about the occurrence by PW2.
17.        The defence, as stated above, failed to elicit anything from the
cross-examination of the witnesses to discredit the prosecution version as
regards the commission of offence of setting fire by the accused-appellant
in the rice mill and the rice godown.
18.        Therefore, there is no hesitation to hold that the learned trial
Court recorded the order of conviction on the basis of the evidence on
record.
19.        So far as the punishment is concerned, the learned trial Court
sentenced the accused-appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 5
years and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/-, in default, to suffer rigorous
imprisonment for 2 months, under Section 436 of the IPC. The sentence,
being within the statutorily prescribed period, needs no interference.
20.        Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
21.        Send down the LCR along with a copy of this judgment and order.
                                                                     JUDGE
