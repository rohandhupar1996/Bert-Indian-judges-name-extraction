21.03.2006, enhanced the compensation @ of Rs.1,73,040.00 per
bigha, irrespective of categorization of land and also granted other

by the learned Reference Court, preferred the present appeal seeking
compensation at the rate of Rs. 2,15,160.00 per bigha besides the
statutory benefits. As there was delay of 1367 days in preferring the
appeal, today counsel for the appellants made a statement in CM

interest for the period of delay and also not press for costs of the
appeal. On his statement, the delay in filing the appeal was condoned
subject to the condition that the appellants would not be entitled to
interest for the period of delay, i.e., 1367 days and also the costs of

         India reported as 2001 (93) DLT 569.
5.         Counsel for the respondent/UOI concedes that the present
case is also covered by the aforesaid judgment.       He further submits
that the aforesaid judgment in the case of Pratap Singh (supra) has
attained finality in view of the fact that the Special Leave Petition
preferred by the respondent/Union of India as also by the landowners,
registered as SLP(Civil) No. 573-628/2010 has been dismissed by the
Supreme Court vide order dated 05.01.2010.
