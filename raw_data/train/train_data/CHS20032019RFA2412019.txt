CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. HARI SHANKAR
%                       J U D G M E N T (ORAL)
1.     This appeal impugns the judgment and decree, dated 22nd
November, 2018, passed by the learned Additional District Judge
(hereinafter referred to as “the learned ADJ”), in a suit filed by the
plaintiff/respondent (hereinafter referred to as “the plaintiff”) under
Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
2.     In the aforesaid suit, the plaintiff sought a decree from the
defendants/appellants (hereinafter referred to as “the defendants”), for
a sum of ₹ 22 lakh.
3.     Consequent to issuance of summons for judgment in the suit, an
application for leave to defend was filed by the defendants, which was
adjudicated by the learned ADJ vide order dated 8th November, 2017,
granting leave to defend to the defendants, conditional to deposit, by
W.P.(C) 241/2019                                                 Page 1 of 3

the defendant, of a bank guarantee for ₹ 22 lakhs favouring the learned
District & Sessions Judge (South West), Dwarka Court, Delhi within
three months.
4.     Admittedly, the defendants impugned the decision before this
Court by way of CM(M) No. 451/2018. Though notice was issued in
the said petition on 18th April, 2018, admittedly, no order interjecting
the proceedings before the learned ADJ was passed by this Court.
5.     CM(M) No. 451/2018 came to be adjourned, by this court, on
several occasions, before the impugned judgment dated 22nd
November, 2018 was passed by the learned ADJ, noting the fact that ,
despite having been granted opportunities to comply with the
directions for deposit of bank guarantee, as contained in the order
dated 8th November, 2017, on 15th February, 2018, 15th March, 2018,
19th April, 2018, 20th September, 2018 and 25th October, 2018, there
had been no compliance, with the such direction, by the defendant.
The learned ADJ, therefore, proceeded to decree the suit.
6.     While doing so, the averments in the plaint have also been taken
into account.
7.     Significantly, the impugned judgment also notes the fact, that
during the course of proceedings before the learned ADJ, Defendant
No.1 categorically stated that he did not intend to comply with the
orders passed by the learned ADJ.
8.     It may also be noted that, consequent to passing of the
impugned judgment dated 22nd November, 2018, by the learned ADJ,
W.P.(C) 241/2019                                               Page 2 of 3

CM(M) No. 451/2018 stands withdrawn by the defendants.
9.     In the circumstances, the learned ADJ could not but have passed
the impugned judgment, in the manner it has been passed.
10.    I do not see how, in exercise of my appellate jurisdiction, I can
interfere with the impugned judgment, which cannot be said to suffer
from any error, either on facts or in law.
11.    Consequently, no case is made out for issuance of notice in this
appeal.
12.    The appeal is accordingly dismissed in limine, with no order as
to costs.
                                              C. HARI SHANKAR, J
