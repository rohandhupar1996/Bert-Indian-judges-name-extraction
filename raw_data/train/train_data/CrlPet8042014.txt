                         Criminal Petition No. 804 of 2014
                                           BEFORE
                 HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK
21.07.2017
             Heard Mr. Gautam Baishya, learned counsel for the accused petitioners.
    Though notice on the complainant/sole opposite party was served, he did not enter
    appearance in the matter and as such, the matter is proceeded ex-parte against
    the said opposite party.
    2.       Petitioners herein are husband and wife and their daughter, namely, Smti.
    Vaishali Das was married to the son of the sole opposite party/ complainant
    namely, Priyanuj Das. On 01.11.2012, the marriage between the petitioners’
    daughter and son of the opposite party/complainant was solemnized under Special
    Marriage Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act, 1994’) and later, their
    marriage was socially performed on 17.01.2013 at Guwahati. While petitioners’
    daughter was living in her matrimonial home in the house of the opposite party
    with her husband, she was behaved cruelly and was abused for not providing
    expensive articles and gifts as dowry. Since the son of the sole opposite
    party/complainant, husband of the daughter of the petitioners physically tortured
    her, the marriage between petitioner’s daughter and son of the sole opposite party/
    complainant was on turmoil.        Said Priyanuj Das, husband of the petitioners’
    daughter and son of the sole opposite party filed an application under Section 23 of
    the Special marriage Act, 1954 before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Kamrup at
    Guwahati being FC (Civil) Case No.768/2013 for his judicial separation with the
    petitioners’ daughter, which was subsequently withdrawn by him. Thereafter, he
    filed another application under Section 27 of the said 1954 Act, for a decree
    dissolving their marriage which was registered as FC (Civil) Case No. 131/2014 and
    the same is pending before the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Kamrup at
    Guwahati. On receipt of notice of said FC (Civil) Case No. 131/2014, the petitioners’
    daughter filed her written statement in the said matter.
    3.       In the meanwhile, because of such physical and mental torture, cruelty and
    demand for dowry made on her by her husband and in-laws, the daughter of the
    Crl. Ptn. No. 804 of 2014                                                Page 1 of 6

petitioners on 14.03.2014 lodged an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of All Women
Police Station, Panbazar, Guwahati against the opposite party herein and his other
family members which was registered as All Women Police Station Case No.
40/2014 under Sections 498-A/506/34 IPC. Being furious with filing of such police
case against them, the opposite party herein as complainant filed a criminal
complaint being CR Case No. 751C/2014 before the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate (CJM), Kamrup (Metro) Guwahati on 11.3.2014 against the present
petitioners, alleging commission of offences under Sections 506/500/34 IPC. The
learned CJM, Kamrup after receipt of the said complaint pertaining to said CR Case
No.751C/2014 of the opposite party/complainant transferred the same to the Court
of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Kamrup (M), Guwahati for its
disposal. After recording the statements of the complainant/opposite party and his
witnesses under Section 200/202 of CrPC, Learned JMFC, Kamrup (M), Guwahati,
the Trial Magistrate on 23.07.2014 in said CR Case No. 751C/2014 took cognizance
of the offences under Sections 294/506 IPC against the petitioners and issued
summons to them in the said complaint case.
4.       Being aggrieved with the said order of the learned Trial Magistrate dated
23.07.2014 passed in CR Case No.751C/2014, the petitioners herein have preferred
this criminal petition praying for quashing the proceeding of said CR Case
No.751C/2014 against them.
5.       This Court while issuing notice in the present case on 26.09.2014 to the sole
opposite party/complainant, in the interim, stayed the further proceeding of said CR
Case No. 751C/2014 against the petitioners, which is still in force.
6.       Section 294 IPC relates to obscene acts and songs and it reads as follows:
         “294. Obscene acts and songs –
                Whoever, to the annoyance of others-
                   (a) Does any obscene act in any public place, or
                   (b) Sings, recites or utters any obscene song, balled or words, in or
                   near any public place,
                Shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
                which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.”
Crl. Ptn. No. 804 of 2014                                                   Page 2 of 6

7.        The essential ingredients for Section 294 IPC are – (i) an obscene act must
have been done in public place or (ii) the act or song or ballad or words were
obscene and (iii) there acts were done by the accused causing annoyance to
others. To bring home an offence under Section 294 IPC there has to be (a) that
the accused did an obscene act in public place or (b) sang, recited or uttered any
obscene song, ballad or words in or near any public place and (c) that such act or
acts caused annoyance to others.
8.       Further, Section 506 IPC relates to punishment for criminal intimidation.
the offence of criminal intimidation is defined under Section 503 IPC and Section
506 IPC provides punishment for it. The essential ingredients of Section 503 IPC
are that (1) threatening a person with any injury; (i) to his person, reputation or
property; or (ii) to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is
interested, (2) and the threat must be with intent (i) to cause alarm to that person

means of avoiding the execution of such threat or (iii) to cause that person to omit

fact being alarmed by the threat; the threat to injury may be in relation to
reputation of a deceased person.
10.      From the reading of the complaint filed by the complainant/the opposite
party herein, it is seen that the date of alleged occurrence of the offence is
09.03.2014. It was alleged in the complaint that the accused persons of the case
including the present petitioners approached the complainant for a amicable
settlement with regard to the case being FC (Civil) 131/2014 pending before the
Family Court at Guwahati between his son and daughter of the petitioners and a
Crl. Ptn. No. 804 of 2014                                                 Page 3 of 6

discussion was held in that regard on 09.03.2014 in the house of one Sri Pradip
Das at Nizarapar, Guwahati, who is the brother of the complainant. The
complainant categorically alleged that during such discussion in the house of his
said brother Pradip Das, one Sri Akan Das all of a sudden started scolding the
complainant in a ferocious mood and threatened the complainant that he would
send the complainant’s son, Priyanuj Das to jail at least for 3 months under Section
498-A IPC or many others. The complainant further alleged that said Akan Das
challenged him by saying that if he could not send the complainant’s son Priyanuj
Das to jail, he would cut his own hand.
11.      From the complaint filed by the opposite party in said CR Case No.
     C
751 /2014, the petitioners have brought to the notice of the Court that there is no
specific averment(s) regarding any such threatening given by the petitioners to said
complainant except alleging that the present petitioners also abused and
threatened him to defame his reputation by sending his son to jail by indulging
498-A IPC. Further, from the statement made by the said complainant/opposite
party before the Trial Magistrate under Section 200 CrPC, it is seen that he
submitted that on 07.03.2014, said Akan Das, maternal uncle of his daughter-in-
law and the present petitioners came to his house for a discussion regarding
mutual divorce as in the meanwhile, his son had filed a divorce case against the
daughter of the petitioners and discussed the issue regarding Rs. 50 Lakhs, which
was not accepted by the complainant and at that point of time, said Akan Das
informed/threatened him that he would send the complainant or his wife or his son
to jail for three months under Section 498-A IPC and if he failed to do so, he would
cut his own hand. In his said statement, the complainant also stated before the
Magistrate that the petitioner No.1 threatened him over phone.
12.       From the records of the case, it is also seen that the statement of the
complainant was recorded by the learned Trial Magistrate on 08.05.2014 and that
there is dissimilarity in his allegations and statements made in his complaint in said
CR Case No. 751C/2014 that he filed by swearing affidavit and the statements
before the concerned Trial Magistrate which he made on oath. The complaint
reveals that cause of action arose on 09.03.2014 in the house of one Sri Pradip
Das, his brother; whereas in his deposition under Section 200 CrPC, before the Trial
Crl. Ptn. No. 804 of 2014                                                Page 4 of 6

Magistrate, the complainant himself stated that the incident occurred on
07.03.2014 in his house. Again from the said deposition of the complainant, it is
also seen that except the statement that the petitioner No.1 threatened him over
phone, there is nothing in his said statement against the petitioners. It is also seen
that the complainant did not state that during such discussion his witness Nos. 1
and 2, Sri Pradip Das and his son, Priyanuj Das respectively were present at the
place of occurrence.
13.      From the records it is seen that said Sri Pradip Das, the witness No. 1 of the
complainant, in his statement under Section 202 CrPC before the Trial Magistrate
on 18.06.2014 stated that when the accused persons came to his house on
09.03.2014 for a mutual settlement regarding the divorce of the son of the
complainant and the daughter of the accused petitioners, the accused persons
demanded Rs. 50 Lakhs from them for such mutual settlement and alleged that Sri
Akan Das, maternal uncle of the daughter-in-law of the complainant threatened
him that he would send the complainant and his son to jail at least for three
months otherwise he would cut his own hand and that the accused persons
threatened the complainant over phone. Similarly the witness No. 2, son of the
complainant/son-in-law of the petitioners in his statement under Section 202 CrPC
before the Trial Magistrate on 10.07.2014 stated that he was not present in the
said discussion held on 09.03.2014 in the house of Sri Pradip Das and in his
statement allegations was only against said Sri Akan Das.
14.      From the above it is seen that the statements of the complainant and his
witness No.1 are in dissimilarity. Moreover, the complainant’s son, his witness No.
2, as per his own statement was not present at the place of occurrence as stated
by him and he is only hearsay witness. Further, neither in the complaint petition
nor in the statement of the complainant or his witness No.1, there is no such
specific averments made against the accused petitioners alleging the offences
under Sections 294/506 IPC. On perusal of the records of the case as well as the
complaint filed by the complainant/the opposite party herein and the statements of
the complainant and his witnesses, no such ingredients of Sections 294/506 IPC are
found against the petitioners, as the alleged incident took place inside the house of
one Sri Pradip Das and in during a heated arguments between them, the
Crl. Ptn. No. 804 of 2014                                                  Page 5 of 6

complainant was allegedly abused by the other accused of the case and not by the
present petitioners. The Court is of the view that abusing someone that he and/or
his family members, relatives or someone from his near and dear shall be sent to
jail under Section 498-A IPC, the person who made such statement or said such
statement cannot be considered as a criminal act under Section 294 and/or 506
IPC.
15.      For the reasons above, this Court is of the view that if the said CR Case No.
     C
751 /2014, that was registered on the basis of the complaint of the
complainant/opposite party, is allowed to continue on the said backdrop, against
the petitioners for the alleged offences under Sections 294/506 IPC, it would be an
abuse of the process of the Court and therefore, for the ends of justice, the
proceeding of said CR Case No. 751C/2014 and the complaint filed by the sole
opposite party in the said CR Case against the present petitioners, the proceeding
of which is presently pending before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati are set aside and quashed. Accordingly, this criminal
petition is allowed.
12.      The interim order dated 26.09.2014 passed earlier in this proceeding stands
merged with this order.
13.      Registry shall return the LCR to the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate,
First Class, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati along with a copy of this order.
                                                                     JUDGE
