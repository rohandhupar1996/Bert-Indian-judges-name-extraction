                    No.85 of 2011, the original complainant has preferred the

Reason:
                    present appeals.

                                 2
3.    That the appellant herein­original Complainant filed a
Criminal Complaint against the private Respondents herein­ the
original accused before the learned Magistrate alleging, inter alia,
that the complainant purchased a plot from Respondent No.1 by
way of a registered sale deed in the year 2005. After sale of the
plot, the original owner­accused No.1 fraudulently resold the
plot in 2010 in favour of Accused No.2 by re­designating as “Plot
No.24”. It is required to be noted that the plot which was sold to
the complainant was numbered as “Plot No.1” in ” Survey
No.121”. It was alleged that the very plot which was sold to the
complainant was sold by the owner by changing the Number and
by re­designating the same as “Plot No.24”. It was alleged that
the second purchaser Respondent No.2­Accused No.2 was none
other than the husband of the original Respondent No.1­
Accused No.1.     It was further alleged that Respondent No.2
thereon sold the very Plot/property in 2011, in favour of the
Respondent No.3­Accused No.3. Therefore, it was alleged that
the all accused persons and one another have committed
offences under Sections 420, 464, 465, 467, 468, 471 read with
Section 34 of IPC. That the learned Magistrate passed an order
for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.PC.      That the
police lodged an FIR for the aforesaid offences. That the accused

                                3
thereafter approached the High Court to quash the FIR by way
of a Petition under Section 482 of Cr.PC.

                                4
3.1 It appears that, by the time, the matter was taken up for
final hearing by the High Court, the Investigating Officer
completed the investigation in the matter and having found the
prima facie case against the accused,       submitted the Final
Report under Section 173 of the Cr.PC concluding that the
accused had colluded and committed offences, as alleged, under
Sections 420, 464, 465, 467, 468, 471 read with Section 34 of
IPC. Despite the fact that, after conclusion of the investigation,
a Final Report under Section 173 was submitted, by the
impugned judgment and order dated 22.11.2013,           the High
Court in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Cr.PC has
quashed the criminal proceedings including the Final Report
arising out of Crime No.85 of 2011 dated 02.12.2011. The High
Court noted that the original Complainant also does not press
the prosecution and considered the statement made by the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of Original Accused that
Plot No.1 of Original Complainant is distinct and has nothing to
do with Plot No. 24. The High Court opined that there is no act
of criminality to cheat the complainant­the purchaser of the
property.    It appears that immediately thereafter it was
mentioned before the High Court by the complainant that he
desires to withdraw the statement made by him, which was the

                               5
basis for disposal of criminal application No.1113/2012.   By
order dated 29.11.2013 the High Court declined withdrawal of
the statement.
3.2 Being    aggrieved  and  dissatisfied with  the impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court in quashing and
setting aside the criminal proceedings including the Final
Report, the Original Complainant has preferred the present
appeals.
4.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the respective parties and considering the impugned judgment
and order passed by the High Court by which the High Court
has quashed and set aside the criminal proceedings and the
Final Report, in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the
Cr.PC, we are of the opinion that the impugned order quashing
the proceedings cannot be sustained.

                                 6
4.2 It is required to be noted that, as such, after the conclusion
of investigation, the Investigating Officer submitted the Final
Report under Section 173 of the Cr.PC, concluding that the
accused have colluded and committed offences under Sections
420, 464, 465, 467, 468, 471 read with Section 34 of IPC. Once
the Final Report was submitted under Section 173 of the Cr.PC,
normally the accused, if aggrieved by the Final Report shall be
relegated to approach the Magistrate for discharge.      Even the
High Court in the impugned order has also observed so. Despite
the above, the High Court has without further discussing
anything on merits of the Final Report has quashed the entire
criminal proceedings, including the Final Report.    On reading of
the impugned order and judgment passed by the High Court, it
appears that the High Court has not even observed anything on
merits of the Final Report and solely relying upon the statement
of the counsel for the Accused as recorded in paragraph 4, has
believed the same and has quashed the criminal proceedings
and the Final Report. Therefore, on merits also, the impugned
judgment and orders passed by the High Court deserve to be
quashed and set aside. At this stage, it is required to be noted
that there was no explanation as to why the original Land
Owner­Accused No.1 sold one plot to her husband (A2) first and

                                7
the same plot was sold to A3.          That, in the facts and
circumstances of the case, once the Investigating Officer
submitted the Final Report on conclusion of the investigation,
the High Court was not justified in interfering with the criminal
proceedings in exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.PC
and particularly when in the Final Report it was specifically
concluded on the basis of the material on record that a prima
facie case is made out for the offences alleged against the
accused persons. Therefore, we are of the opinion that, in the
facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has clearly
erred in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Cr.PC and
in quashing and setting aside the criminal proceedings including
the Final Report.
4.3 In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the
present appeals succeed.    The impugned judgment and order
passed by the High Court dated 22.11.2013 passed in Criminal
Application No.1113/2012 is hereby quashed and set aside.
Consequently, the prosecution against the Accused to proceed
further in accordance with law, and on its own merits.

                                8
 5. The appeals are allowed accordingly.
