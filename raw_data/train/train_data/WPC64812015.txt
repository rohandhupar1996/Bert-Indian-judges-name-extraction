Nos. 1 & 2. Mr. R.S. Deuri, the learned counsel appears for the respondent Nos.
3, 6 & 8 and Mr. U.B. Sharma, the learned counsel appears for the respondent
Nos. 4 and 7.
2.    The case of the writ petitioner is that he was appointed as Junior Assistant
under the Director of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Department, Government
of Assam in terms of the recommendation of the duly constituted selection
committee and conveyed to the Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
                                                                             Page 2 of 7

                                                                   WP(C) 6481/2015
vide communication dated 20.02.2009 (Annexure-1) by the Directorate of
Employment & Craftsmen Training, Assam. Pursuant to the said communication,
the petitioner was appointed as Junior Assistant vide order dated 20.05.2009
(Annexure-2).
3.   The respondent authorities thereafter published a gradation list of Ministerial
Staff under the Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department as
on 01.05.2012 wherein, the consideration for fixation of seniority was as per the
date of birth of the respective employees and not as per the order of merit as
was communicated on 20.02.2009.
4.      Having received complaints, the gradation list for the post of Junior
Assistant besides others was sought to be rectified in terms of Rule 19 (5) of the
Assam Directorate Establishment (Ministerial) Service Rules, 1973 (Service Rules)
which provide that the inter-se seniority of Lower Division Assistant/Junior
Assistant appointed under the Rules on the same day should be drawn in the
order of selection made by the appointing authority. Accordingly, the gradation
list was rectified and before finalization of the same, a notice was issued by the
respondent No. 2 inviting objections if any vide order dated 20.11.2014
(Annexure-6).
5.      It may be noticed herein that as per the recommendation of the Selection
Committee, the name of the petitioner was placed above all the private
respondents but however as per the gradation list that was published as on
01.05.2012, his seniority position was at serial No. 12, amongst the Junior
Assistant working under the Directorate. Private respondent Nos. 5, 6 and 7 were
placed above him whereas, private respondent Nos. 4 and 8 where placed below
him. Upon examination of the gradation list in terms of the Rules 19 (5) of the
Service Rules and considering the recommendation of the Selection Committee
with the objections that were filed, the petitioner was placed above all the
private respondents vide order dated 31.12.2014 passed by the respondent
No.2. A rectified gradation list as on 01.05.2012 in terms of the order dated
31.12.2014 passed by the respondent No. 2 was thus published.
                                                                         Page 3 of 7

                                                                    WP(C) 6481/2015
6.       It may be noticed herein that prior to the rectification of the gradation
list, the respondent authorities on the recommendation of the Selection
Committee held on 01.01.2014 promoted 5 (five) Junior Assistants including the
respondent Nos. 3, 5 & 6 to the post of Senior Assistant under the Directorate.
The promoted private respondents were in fact all junior to the petitioner as per
the rectified gradation list. Thereafter, respondent authorities again held a
selection process for promotion of Junior Assistant to the post of Senior Assistant
on 04.09.2015 whereby, the respondent Nos. 4, 7 and 8 besides two other
persons were recommended for promotion to the post of Senior Assistance under
the Directorate. Although, the gradation list was rectified showing the petitioner
senior to all the private respondents, the respondent authorities did not recall the
promotion of the private respondent Nos. 3, 5 and 6 and in fact no sooner, vide
the Selection Committee meeting minutes dated 04.09.2015 recommended the
promotion of the respondent Nos. 4, 7 and 8. The petitioner being aggrieved
approached the respondent authorities by filing representations on 29.10.2014
and 10.09.2015 claiming seniority and promotion w.e.f 01.01.2014. However, the
respondent authorities failed to redress his grievance and therefore, the
petitioner is before this Court.
7.       Mr. U.K. Nair, the learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner
submits that the gradation list under the Directorate was only due for
rectification in view of the fact that the relevant Service Rules i.e Rule 19(5)
provide that the inter-see senior of Junior Assistant has to be drawn in the order
of selection made by appointing authority whereas the gradation list was
prepared and seniority drawn on the basis of date of birth of the employees.
Therefore, the petitioner having been placed above all the private respondents in
the merit list prepared by the constituted selection committee, the gradation list
was rightly rectified. However, despite the gradation list being rectified, the
respondent authorities failed to take any steps for giving the petitioner the
benefit of promotion with seniority. He submits that the respondent authorities
ought to have recalled the promotion orders of the private respondents and
reconsider the entire matter afresh in terms of the rectified gradation list. The
                                                                         Page 4 of 7

                                                                    WP(C) 6481/2015
same having not been done he submits that the respondents are liable to be
suitably directed by this Court.
8.      Mr. U.K. Nair by referring to the selection proceedings held on
01.01.2014 submits that the criteria adopted for promotion from the post of
Junior Assistant to Senior Assistant was seniority cum merit in terms of the Rules
of 1973 as adviced by the Judicial Department of the State. Therefore, the
petitioner upon the rectification of the gradation list being placed senior to the
private respondents, the petitioner is only to be considered for promotion w.e.f
the date of DPC held on 01.01.2014. As for the selection held on 04.09.2015, he
submits that he does not press the same.
9.      Mr. M.R. Adhikary, the learned Government Advocate on the other hand
by referring to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No. 2 submits
that since the private respondents concerned already stood promoted in the
meantime prior to the rectification of the gradation list, the respondent authority
decided not to interfere with their promotion. As for the petitioner, his seniority
would be maintained as an when he is promoted to the post of Senior Assistant.
Mr. M.R. Adhikary submits that as far as the selection process that was held on
04.09.2015 is concerned, post based rooster point was applied and vacancies
earmarked for the reserved category in so far as 3 (three) posts are concerned
was applied. Therefore, the respondent Nos. 4, 7 and 8 were accordingly
recommended against the reserve category.
10.     Ms. R. S. Deuri, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 3,
6 and 8 submits that the respondent authorities did not commit any illegality in
recommending the respondent Nos. 3, 6 and 8 for promotion to the post of
Senior Assistant as per the selection proceedings held on 01.01.2014 and in fact
on application of the 100 point rooster policy, the petitioner would not have been
eligible to be promoted to the post of Senior Assistant anyway. Under such
circumstances, she submits that promotion of the respondent No. 3, 6 and 8
does not call for any interference by this Court.
                                                                         Page 5 of 7

                                                                   WP(C) 6481/2015
11.     Mr. U.B. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent Nos.
4 and 7 submits that the said respondents have not filed affidavit-in-opposition
but nevertheless he supports the contention of the respondent Nos. 3, 6 and 8
and adopts the argument of Ms. R.S. Deuri.
12.     I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused
the materials available on record. The facts which are not in dispute are that the
gradation list was initially published by following the date of birth of the
employee concerned for reckoning seniority in the gradation list. Consequently,
the gradation list after issuance of notice to the parties concerned was rectified
by the respondent No.2 applying Rule 19(5) of the Service Rules which provides
that promotion made under the Rules should be on the basis of seniority as
drawn for appointments made under Sub-Rule 1(2) and Rule 10 of the Rules on
the same day according to the list. Accordingly, rectified gradation list was
published on 31.12.2014. Therefore, as per the rectified gradation list also as on
01.05.2012, the petitioner is senior to all the private respondents. The petitioner
would therefore would have to be considered for promotion as per the rectified
gradation list with effect from the date when the selection committee met on
01.01.2014.
13.      It may also be noticed that the Selection Committee which met on
01.04.2014 did not adopt the reservation policy for making the selection. In fact,
the criteria that was adopted as can be seen was seniority cum merit from
amongst the Junior Assistant for promotion to the post of Senior Assistant. In
such circumstances, the respondent authorities would be required to recall the
promotion order made to those Junior Assistant who are junior to the petitioner
or promote the petitioner with effect from the date on which they were
promoted.
14.     Considering the fact that the respondent Nos. 3, 5 and 6 besides others
having been promoted on 20.01.2014 and the contention of the State
respondents in their affidavit-in-opposition that the seniority of the petitioner
would be maintained on his promotion, I am of the considered opinion that
without disturbing the promotion of the private respondents concerned, the
                                                                        Page 6 of 7

                                                                  WP(C) 6481/2015
petitioner should be given promotion to the post of Senior Assistant from the
date the respondent Nos. 3, 5 and 6 were promoted. The State respondents in
their affidavit in opposition have also contended that 2 (two) vacancies have
arisen due to the promotion incumbents to the next higher post. In that of view
of the matter, the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are directed to promote the
petitioner to the post of Senior Assistant w.e.f 20.01.2014, i.e., the date on
which his juniors were promoted with all consequential benefits. Such exercise
shall be carried out within a period of 6 weeks from the date of receipt of a
certified copy of this order.
15.      With the above observations and directions, the writ petition is allowed.
No cost.
