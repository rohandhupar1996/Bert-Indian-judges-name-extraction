                              JUDGMENT
                               19.04.2018
SANJEEV SACHDEVA, J. (ORAL)
CRL.M.C. 1498/2018 & Crl.M.A.5444/2018 (stay)
1.      Petitioners seek quashing of FIR No.385/2017 under Sections
354/380/498A IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, based on
a settlement. Subsequently, Section 376 IPC has been added after
recording statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 Cr.P.C.
2.      The allegation against the petitioner No.2, who is the sister of
the petitioner No.1, is of alleged demand of dowry. Insofar as the
CRL.M.C. 1498/2018                                                Page 1 of 3

petitioner No.1 is concerned, the allegations are not only of demand of
dowry but also of making physical relationship by use of force.
3.     Respondent No.2 is present in Court in person and submits that
she has settled with the petitioners and she and the petitioner No.1
have got married and are residing together as husband and wife. She
submits that she does not wish to press her complaint.
4.     Since the allegations against the petitioner No.1 are of having
allegedly committed the offence under Section 376 IPC, in view of the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Gyan Singh vs. State of Punjab:
2012 (10) SCC 303, the present case is not a fit case for quashing of
the FIR based on a settlement, qua petitioner No. 1.
5.     Accordingly, so far as the petitioner No.1 is concerned, keeping
in view of the said judgment of Gyan Singh (supra), I am not inclined
to exercise discretionary powers of quashing the FIR qua him.
6.     Learned APP submits that allegations against petitioner No. 2
are only under section 498A IPC and not under Section 354/380 or
376 IPC.
7.     Insofar as the petitioner No.2 is concerned, since the only
allegation against the petitioner No.2 are under section 498A IPC of
alleged demand of dowry and respondent No.2 has also settled with
her and has subsequently married her brother and is living with him, I
am of the view that it is a fit case for quashing the FIR qua the
CRL.M.C. 1498/2018                                            Page 2 of 3

petitioner No.2.
8.     In view of the above, the subject FIR No.385/2017 and the
consequent proceedings emanating there from, qua petitioner No.2, are
quashed. The petition qua petitioner No. 1 is dismissed.
9.     The petition is disposed of in the above terms.
10.    Order Dasti under signatures of Court Master.
