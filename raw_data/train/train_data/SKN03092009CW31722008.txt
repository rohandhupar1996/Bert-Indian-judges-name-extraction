%
1.      The petitioner, Ms. Madhavi Devi, claims that she had purchased
200 square yards of land bearing plot No. 273 in khasra No. 46 in village
Kondli on 18th April, 1974 for Rs.1,500/-on the basis of power of attorney
executed by the recorded bhumidar. The land in question was already
acquired land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 vide award No.
84/A/72-73.
2.      The petitioner on 30th June, 1981 and again on 19th October, 1981
filed an application for allotment of alternative land.            She made a
statement that a claim had been made by her for payment of
W.P. (C) No. 3172/2008                                                   Page 1

compensation for the acquired land.
3.      By letter dated 13th June, 1986, the petitionerâ€™s husband was
informed that the case for alternative land has been rejected since the
land acquired was less than 1 bigha.
4.      The petitioner made another representation and by letter dated 10 th
September, 1987 she was asked to file an application in the prescribed
form in duplicate along with documents like sale deed, compensation and
affidavit. The petitioner filed an application in the prescribed form but her
application was not accepted and vide letter dated 14th August, 1991 she
was informed that the land purchased by the petitioner was through power
of attorney and as such the petitioner was not the lawful owner of the
plot. This decision was reiterated again by the respondents by letter dated
28th December, 1991. The letter dated 28th December, 1991 further states
that as per the policy only recorded owners of the acquired land prior to
notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 were entitled
to allotment of alternative plot.
5.      The petitioner has filed the present petition in 2008 seeking
allotment of alternative land. She challenges rejection of her request for
allotment of alternative land vide letters dated 13th June, 1986, 14th
August, 1991 and 28th December, 1991. She relies upon the judgment
passed by the learned Additional District Judge in LAC No. 45/1993 dated
15th October, 1998 deciding reference under Section 30/31 of the Land
W.P. (C) No. 3172/2008                                                  Page 2

Acquisition Act, 1894 holding that the petitioner was entitled to
compensation for the acquired land. It is accordingly submitted that delay
and laches should not come in the way of the petitioner as she is entitled
to allotment of alternative land. Reference is also made to representations
made by the petitioner but it is admitted that the said representations
have been rejected throughout. My attention in this regard is drawn to
letter dated 30th April, 2003, whereby Government of NCT of Delhi, Land
and Building Department, had informed the petitioner that she was not
entitled to allotment of alternative land as she was not the recorded owner
of the acquired land prior to the date of notification under Section 4 of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
6.      The writ petition is clearly bad for delay and laches.     As noted
above, the application for allotment of alternative land was rejected way
back in 1989 and then again in 1991. The said rejection was on account
of the fact that the petitioner was not the recorded owner of the acquired
land prior to the date of notification under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894. Decision in the reference proceedings under Section
30/31 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 did not result in any change or
modification in the position.     The petitioner never became the recorded
owner in the revenue record. The only question decided in the reference
under Section 30/31 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 related to payment
of claim for compensation. The respondents vide letter dated 30th April,
W.P. (C) No. 3172/2008                                                 Page 3

2003 had again informed the petitioner that she was not entitled to
alternative land in lieu of acquired land as she was not recorded owner
prior to the date of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894.     The delay between 2003 and 2008 is again not
explained.
7.      A Division Bench of this Court in Gulshan versus Government of
NCT of Delhi, 2008 (101) DRJ 661 (DB) has held that a person, who is
not recorded owner of the land prior to the date of issue of notification
under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, is not entitled to
alternative plot under the policy/scheme.         Admittedly, the land was
acquired pursuant to award No. 84/A/72-73 in the year 1972-73.          The
petitioner claims that she had purchased the said land after the award on
18th April, 1974. The petitioner was admittedly not the bhumidar of the
land when it was acquired.         Subsequent purchaser is not entitled to
alternative allotment.
        The writ petition accordingly has no merit and is dismissed.
