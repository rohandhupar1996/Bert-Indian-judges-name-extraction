                                      JUDGMENT
                       Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
                       1)    These appeals are filed against the final
                       judgment and order dated 05.03.2003 passed by
                       the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in LAA
                       No.905 of 1995 whereby the Division Bench of the
                       High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the
Signature Not Verified original appellant herein. Against the said order,

Reason:
                                                                          1

the appellant filed review petition being R.P. No.205
of 2004 which was also dismissed.
2)   In order to appreciate the short controversy
involved in these appeals, it is necessary to set out
few relevant facts hereinbelow.
3)   During the pendency of the appeals in this
Court,    the    appellant   died    and   his   legal
representatives were brought on record.
4)   The original appellant is the owner of the land
measuring around 4.30 acres situated in the
District of Kottyam (Kerala). The State of Kerala
issued   a  notification   dated   25.11.1980   under
Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for
short called "the Act“) and acquired total land
measuring     around     30    acres   in   Kottayam
Municipality for implementation of      "multipurpose
development scheme at Kodimatha" on the acquired
land. It was followed by declaration under Section
                                                      2

6 of the Act. The appellant's land (4.30 acres) was
also acquired in these acquisition proceedings by
notification issued under Section 4 of the Act.
5)    The Land Acquisition Officer (LAO) then held
an enquiry, as contemplated under Section 11 of
the Act, for payment of compensation to the
landowners and by his award dated           06.08.1984
determined the compensation as under:
      For Dry land    :    Rs.4631/­ per cent
      For Chira land :     Rs.1725/­ per cent
      For Wet land :       Rs.203/­ per cent
6)    The    appellants   felt    aggrieved   by   the
determination    made   by    the   LAO   and   sought
reference to the Civil Court. By award dated
28.02.1990, the Reference Court re­determined the
compensation as under:
      For Dry land    :    Rs.7500/­ per cent
      For Chira land :     Rs.2000/­ per cent
      For Wet land :       Rs.2000/­ per cent
                                                      3

7)    Felt aggrieved by the award of the Reference
Court, the State filed an appeal in the High Court of
Kerala. The High Court, by order dated 23.06.1992
allowed the appeal and remanded the case to the
Reference Court for fresh determination. After the
remand, the Reference Court by award 07.01.1995
re­determined the compensation as under :
      For Dry land    :    Rs.5000/­ per cent
      For Chira land :     Rs.2500/­ per cent
      For Wet land :       Rs.450/­ per cent
8)    By   the   aforesaid  award    passed  by  the
Reference Court, the appellant felt aggrieved and
filed appeal in the High Court. By impugned order,
the High Court made partial modification in the
compensation and determined the compensation as
under:
      For Dry land    :    Rs.5000/­ per cent
      For Chira land :     Rs.2500/­ per cent
      For Wet land :       Rs.500/­ per cent
                                                     4

9)   The appellant felt aggrieved by the order
passed by the High Court and filed review petition
in the High Court. By order dated 02.09.2003, the
High Court disposed of the review petition and made
partial modification in the compensation as under:
     For Dry land     :    Rs.8000/­ per cent
     For Chira land :      No increase
     For Wet land :        No increase
10)  The    original    appellant  (landowner)   felt
aggrieved by the order of the High Court passed in
main appeal as well as in the review petition, filed
the present appeals by way of special leave in this
Court.
11)  So far as the appellants are concerned, they
are mainly concerned with the determination made
by the Courts below for the “wet land” and “chira
land”.
12)  Therefore, the short question, which arises for
consideration in these appeals, is whether the
                                                     5

determination made by the Courts below in relation
to “wet land” and “chira land” is just and proper or
it requires any modification by way of enhancement
as claimed by the appellants (landowners) in these
appeals.
13)   Heard learned counsel for the parties.
14)   At the outset, learned counsel appearing for
the appellants brought to our notice that the
Reference Court in another case of the landowners,
whose lands were also acquired in these very
acquisition     proceedings,      determined      the
compensation at the rate of Rs. 2000/­ per cent for
the wet land.
15)   It was his submission that the determination
made by the Reference Court was not challenged by
the State and hence it became final. Learned
counsel,   therefore,  contended    that  since   the
appellants’ land and the other landowners’      land,
                                                     6

who were awarded compensation in these very
acquisition proceedings, are identical in all respects,
therefore, they are also entitled to claim the
compensation at the same rate, i.e., Rs. 2000/­ per
cent which was awarded to other landowners for
their wet land.
16)   We find force in the submission of learned
counsel for the appellants. It is more so when the
learned counsel for the respondents could not
dispute this factual statement except to support the
reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the High
Court in the impugned order.
17)   Even otherwise on perusal of the entire record
of the case and the findings of all the Courts below,
we are of the opinion that the findings recorded by
the Reference Court in the earlier round of litigation
awarding Rs. 2000/­ per cent for the wet land
                                                       7

though set aside by the High Court in the earlier
round yet it deserves to be restored again.
18)   In other words, in our view, the award of
Rs.2000/­ per cent for the wet land appears to be
just, proper and reasonable keeping in view the
nature of the land, its surroundings and location
and similarity with the land owned by other
landowners to whom compensation was awarded at
the rate of Rs.2000/­ per cent. In our opinion, it
represents correct market value of the wet land on
the date of acquisition (25.11.1980) and was,
therefore, rightly determined by the Reference Court
in cases of other landowners in relation to their
lands acquired in these proceedings.
19)   So far as the rates of other two nature of lands
are concerned, namely, dry and chira, their rates do
not call for any interference and nor any attempt
                                                      8

was made by the appellants to question its legality
and, in our view, rightly.
20)  In this view of the matter, we are of the
considered view that the appellants are entitled to
claim compensation for their wet land at the rate of
Rs. 2000/­ per cent in place of Rs. 500/­ per cent
determined by the High Court in the impugned
order. As a necessary consequence, the appellants
are also entitled for other statutory compensation
payable   under    the   Act keeping  in  view  the
enhancement made by this Court.
                                                    9

21)  In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeals
succeed and are hereby allowed in part. The
Impugned order is modified to the extent indicated
above.
