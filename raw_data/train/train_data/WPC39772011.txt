                  2.      The petitioner was recruited as a Constable in the year 1992 and was
                  attached with the 73rd Battalion of the CRPF. In pursuant to a Disciplinary
                  Proceeding (DP), he was removed from service on 31.3.1997. The aggrieved
                  Constable filed the Civil Rule No.3491/1998 to challenge the disciplinary action
                  and the Writ Court on 16.2.2004 (Annexure-A) had observed that since the
                  delinquent had caused a simple injury to a colleague, the removal punishment is
                  disproportionate. The Disciplinary Authority was accordingly directed to re-
                  consider the penalty under the judgment dated 16.2.2004 (Annexure-A).The
                  CRPF authorities then filed the Writ Appeal No.225 /2004 but the same was
                  dismissed by the Division Bench on 15.11.2006. The Review petition No.47/2009
                  was then filed by the employer but this too was rejected by the Court on
                  29.10.2009.
                  3.      During the pendency of the Writ Appeal, the office order dated 20.7.2005
                  (Annexure-B) was issued whereby, the Commandant of the 73rd Battalion,
                  reinstated the petitioner and he resumed the duty as a CRPF Constable on
                  26.7.2005.
                  4.      In terms of the direction issued by the High Court in the Civil Rule
                  No.3491/1998, the removal penalty was substituted by the punishment of
                  stoppage of increments for 3 years with cumulative effect, under the office order
                  of June, 2010 (Annexure-F). The intervening period between removal to
                  reinstatement (1.4.1997 – 25.7.2005) was categorized as Dies Non, by the
                  Disciplinary Authority.
                  5.1     Mr. R Hazarika, the learned Counsel submits that that the Dies Non
                  categorization of the out of job period will perhaps disentitle the Constable to
                  receive any salary but he contends that under the punishment order of June,
                  2010 (Annexure-F), increments and promotional opportunities cannot be denied,
                  for the serving Constable.
                   5.2    The petitioner argues that his junior colleagues are receiving better salary
WP(c) No.3977/2011
                                                                                Page 2 of 4

                                                            3
                  and have also been promoted to higher rank and even though the gap period of
                  1.4.1997 – 25.7.2005 may not entail any salary payment, the out of service
                  period should notionally be taken into account, for considering increment and
                  promotion, for the long serving Constable.
                  6.      On the other hand, Mr. A C Kalita, the learned CGC submits that when the
                  High Court directed the disciplinary authority to impose a lesser penalty for the
                  delinquent Constable, the authorities have complied with the Court’s direction
                  and ordered for stoppage of increment. Since no service was received from the
                  delinquent between 1.4.1997 – 25.7.2005, the CGC submits that the petitioner
                  cannot claim any service benefit, for this gap period.
                  7.      For the misconduct committed by the Constable, the disciplinary authority
                  has directed for stoppage of increment for 3 years with cumulative effect and the
                  off service period was ordered to be treated as Dies Non. While such penalization
                  will disentitle the Constable to salary for the non-working period, the gap in
                  service can however be notionally counted for determining the terminal benefits,
                  increments and also consideration of promotion, for the reinstated Constable.
                  8.      The petitioner has served in the CRPF since 1992 and by now, many of
                  his contemporaries have been promoted and all of them are receiving better
                  emoluments than the petitioner. If the punishment of stoppage of increment
                  would also entail denial of increments, terminal benefits and non-consideration of
                  promotion for the long serving Constable, such deprivation in my understanding,
                  will amount to double punishments for the solitary misconduct committed by the
                  Constable. The penalty of stoppage of increment imposed on the petitioner in
                  June, 2010 is to continue for 3 years with cumulative effect but when the
                  punishment period ends, the Constable is entitled to consideration for increment,
                  promotion and also terminal benefits like all his colleagues in the CRPF.
                  9.      However, unfortunately the employer has failed to consider the
WP(c) No.3977/2011
                                                                                 Page 3 of 4

                                                            4
                  increments and promotion for the Constable for all these years. This in my
                  understanding has resulted in injustice for the petitioner and therefore, the
                  employer must be ordered to restore the service entitlement for the petitioner.
                  10.     Following the above, the respondents are directed to allow increments for
                  the Constable and also consider his promotion in accordance with the applicable
                  norms, by considering him to be in service only notionally, between 1.4.1997 –
                  25.7.2005. As the petitioner has been subjected to multiple litigations and has
                  been denied the usual service benefits, the employer must consider the
                  entitlement of the petitioner in terms of this direction within 3 months, from the
                  date of receipt of this order. However, it is made clear that the petitioner shall
                  not be entitled to any salary for the gap period. It is ordered accordingly.
                  11.     With the above direction, the case stands allowed in the manner indicated
                  by leaving the parties to bear their respective cost.
                                                                                      JUDGE
