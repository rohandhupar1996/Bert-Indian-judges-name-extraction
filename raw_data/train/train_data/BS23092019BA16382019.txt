           DIGVIJAY SAROHA                           ..... Petitioner
                             Through:    Mr. Akhand Pratap Singh,
                                          Advocate
                             versus
           STATE                                     ..... Respondent
                             Through:    Mr. G. M. Farooqui, APP for
                                         State with Inspector Sanjay
                                         Gupta from PS-Spl. Cell.

                                 ORDER
BRIJESH SETHI, J.
1.         The Petitioner herein, Digvijay Saroha has preferred the
present bail application seeking regular bail under section 439 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) read with Section 12 &
21(4) of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999
(MCOCA) in case FIR No. 252/2018, P.S. Alipur under sections
3 & 4 of MCOCA titled State v. Digvijay Saroha & Ors. pending
adjudication before Ld. ASJ-03, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi.
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                          Page no.1

2.         Ld. Counsel for the petitioner has prayed for bail on the
ground that the petitioner who is facing trial under section 3 and 4
of MCOC Act and has been in judicial custody since 24.06.2018.
He had filed an application seeking bail before Ld. Trial Court and
vide order dated 07.06.2019, the Ld. Trial Court has dismissed the
bail application. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted
that allegations against the petitioner are totally false and frivolous.
He is shown to be a member of the Jitender @ Gogi Syndicate.
Whereas he is an accused only in one FIR bearing no. 401/14, u/s.
307/34 IPC, PS Alipur and on the basis of the said FIR, the
prosecution is claiming him to be a member of the Jitender @ Gogi
syndicate. Minimum two FIRs are required to have been registered
against the petitioner to invoke MCOCA. Ld. Trial Court has failed
to appreciate the fact that essential ingredients of Sec. 2(d) of
MCOCA are not made out. It is further argued that even
requirement of Section 23 (1) (a) of the MCOC Act was not
complied with as no document was sent to the Competent
Authority while seeking approval under the said Act.
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                          Page no.2

4.         It is further submitted that Ld. Trial Court has failed to
appreciate that prosecution in its proposal had not placed any copy
of the chargesheet which they are alleging to be that of a crime
syndicate. At the time when the proposal was sent, there was no
evidence with the investigating officer to show that there were
some proceeds of crime from the offences committed by the
petitioner. There was no evidence before Sanctioning Authority to
come to the conclusion that petitioner is a member of crime
syndicate.
5.         It is further submitted by Ld. Counsel that on the date of
commission of offence, the ingredients of Section 3 of MCOCA
were not made out. The petitioner is not involved in continuing
unlawful activity and as per Section 2 (d) of MCOCA, more than
one chargesheet should have been filed against the petitioner
within the preceding period of 10 years. Whereas, only one
chargesheet is pending against him. Thus, prima facie there was no
justification to invoke the provisions of MCOCA.
6.         It is lastly submitted by Ld. Counsel that Ld. Trial Court has
failed to appreciate that statement of Ms. Nikita Dahiya recorded
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                           Page no.3

u/s. 161 CrPC was not placed before the sanctioning authority and
in view of irregularities and infirmities in the prosecution version,
the petitioner be released on bail, in the interest of justice.
7.         In support of his argument, learned counsel for petitioner
has relied upon the following judgments;
   i.      State v. Satya Prakash [Crl. M. C. No. 2138 of 2010 of Delhi
           High Court].
  ii.      Altaf Ismail v. State [2005(1) Bombay C.R. (Crl) 833].
 iii.      Maharashtra v. Lalit Somdatta Nagpal [2007] 2 SCC (cri)
           241].
 iv.       Pankaj Jagshi Gangar v. State of Maharashtra, Cr.W.P. No.
           4639/2018.
  v.       Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav v. State of Maharashtra &
           anr.
 vi.       Mahipal Singh v. CBI (2014) 11 SCC 282.
8.         The Bail Application is vehemently opposed by the State.
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor Mr. G. M. Farooqi,
submitted that offences alleged against the accused are serious in
nature. He further submitted that complete material was present
before the approving authority while taking approval u/s. 23(1) &
23(2) of the MCOCA. Ld. APP has further submitted that there is
sufficient material on record to show that petitioner Digvijay
Saroha was member of crime syndicate of Jitender @ Gogi and
petitioner has committed organized crime. It is further submitted
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                          Page no.4

that there is rivalry of supremacy between Jitender @ Gogi and
Sunil @ Tillu gang. Both the gang leaders belong to outer Delhi.
Due to their rivalry, more than 10 murders have taken place. On
18th June 2018, in the area of Sant Nagar, Burari, two innocent
persons were killed by Gogi gang besides killing of one gang
member each from both the groups. In March 2016, Jitender @
Gogi was arrested by the police but on 31.07.2016, his armed
associates got him forcefully released from police custody while he
was being taken to court in Haryana. Since then he has been
continuously involved in illegal activities and committing heinous
crimes and eliminating the members of rival gang.
9.         It is further submitted by Ld. APP that gang members of
Jitender @ Gogi are committing unlawful activities continuously
for gaining some pecuniary benefits for themselves, their family
members & members of their organized crime syndicate and for
other advantages as well. The criminal history indicates that
Jitender @ Gogi and the other members of his organized crime
syndicate singly or jointly have used violence by beating or firing
and threatening the complainants/ victims of those cases which are
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                    Page no.5

registered against the organized crime syndicate with the objective
of gaining unlawful pecuniary benefits, or gaining undue economic
or other advantages for himself or other members of his gang. The
following cases have been registered against Jitender @ Gogi and
his gang members;

10.        It is further submitted by Ld. APP that in the present case,
accused Digvijay Saroha and five more accused persons have been
arrested. Accused Digvijay was arrested in this case on 24.06.2018
as he is an active member of 'Organised Crime Syndicate' led by
notorious criminal Jitender @ Gogi. Ld. APP for the State further
submitted that petitioner/ accused Digvijay Saroha was previously
arrested with accused Jitender @ Gogi, in case FIR No. 401/2014,
dated 27.04.2014, u/s. 307/34 IPC, PS Alipur, Delhi. Ld. APP has
further submitted that sufficient material was placed before the
Sanctioning Authority while seeking approval u/s. 23(1) (a) of
MCOC Act. Sanction was also granted by Sanctioning Authority
after application of mind. He further submitted that during
investigation, one witness namely Ms. Nikita Dahiya has deposed
that this 'Orgainised Crime Syndicate' used to collect extortion
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                               Page no.7

money from her and accused Digvijay Saroha is one of the
associates of this gang, who used to collect protection money from
her. It is further submitted that statements of two accused persons
namely Dinesh and Yogesh were recorded on 10.08.2018 u/s. 18
MCOC Act and these statements were duly vetted by the Ld.
ACMM, Patiala House Court. Accused Yogesh has admitted that
Digvijay Saroha is a member of Jitender @ Gogi gang.
11.        Ld. APP for the state has further argued that it is wrong to
assert that minimum requirement to invoke MCOCA against any
individual is requirement of two FIRs against the said person. Ld.
APP has submitted that the facts appearing on record establish that
the petitioner accused has had a clear role in facilitating and
abetting the commission of the organized crime by Jitender @ Gogi
and his associates in the crime syndicate and he accordingly prayed
for dismissal of the present bail application.
12.        I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned APP for the State and am of the opinion that there is no
merit in the bail application as there is sufficient material available
on record to, prima facie, indicate the involvement of the petitioner
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                         Page no.8

in abetting, conspiring and knowingly facilitating the commission
of organized crime alleged to have been carried out by Jitender @
Gogi and his associates. The judgments cited by Ld. Counsel for the
petitioner on sanction are not relevant for the reason that
prosecution has categorically submitted that all relevant material
was placed before Sanctioning Authority before grant of sanction
and moreover at the stage of bail, the Court is not supported to go
into the facts in detail and give a finding that sanction is in
accordance with law or not. This issue will be decided by the Ld.
Trial Court at appropriate stage during the trial. So far as contention
of Ld. Counsel that since two chargesheets were not in existence
against the petitioner at the time of invocation of provisions of
MCOCA and, therefore, requirement of Sec. 2(d) of the MCOC Act
is not fulfilled, is concerned, there are two judgments to refute the
said submission. One is that of Bombay High Court and another one
is of Hon‟ble Supreme Court. The Hon‟ble Division Bench of
Bombay High Court in a case titled ‘Govind Sakharam Ubhe v.
State of Maharashtra, 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 770’, has
interpreted the words "in respect of which more than one charge-
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                        Page no.9

sheet have been filed" used in section 2(d) of the Act and has held
as follows:
                     “35. It is now necessary to go to the definition
                     of `continuing unlawful activity'. Section
                     2(1)(d) defines `continuing unlawful activity'
                     to mean an activity prohibited by law for the
                     time being in force, which is a cognizable
                     offence punishable with imprisonment of three
                     years or more, undertaken either singly or
                     jointly as a member of an organized crime
                     syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in
                     respect of which more than one chargesheet
                     have been filed before a competent court
                     within the preceding ten years and that court
                     have taken cognizance of such offence. Thus,
                     for an activity to be a `continuing unlawful
                     activity' –
                     a) the activity must be prohibited by law;
                     b) it must be a cognizable offence punishable
                     with imprisonment of three years or more;
                     c) it must be undertaken singly or jointly;
                     d) it must be undertaken as a member of an
                     organized crime syndicate or on behalf of such
                     syndicate
                     e) in respect of which more than one charge-
                     sheet have been filed before a competent court.
                     36. The words 'in respect of which more than
                     one charge-sheet have been filed' cannot go
                     with the words 'a member of a crime syndicate'
                     because in that case, these words would have
                     read as 'in respect of whom more than one
                     charge-sheet have been filed'.
                     37. A person may be a part of the module
                     which jointly undertakes an organized crime or
                     he may singly as a member of the organized
                     crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate
                     undertake an organized crime. In both the
                     situations, the MCOCA can be applied. It is
                     the membership of organized crime syndicate
                     which makes a person liable under the
                     MCOCA. This is evident from section 3(4) of
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                              Page no.10

                     the MCOCA which states that any person who
                     is a member of an organized crime syndicate
                     shall be punished with imprisonment for a
                     term which shall not be less than five years but
                     which may extend to imprisonment for life and
                     shall also be liable to fine, subject to a
                     minimum of fine of Rs.5 lakhs. The charge
                     under the MCOCA ropes in a person who as a
                     member of the organized crime syndicate
                     commits organized crime i.e. acts of extortion
                     by giving threats, etc. to gain economic
                     advantage or supremacy, as a member of the
                     crime syndicate singly or jointly. Charge is in
                     respect of unlawful activities of the organized
                     crime syndicate.
                     38. In order to substantiate our construction of
                     Section 2(1)(d) of the MCOCA, we will take
                     hypothetical example of accused 1(A), accused
                     2(B), accused 3(C) and accused 4(D), who are
                     members of the organized crime syndicate and
                     who have committed crimes within preceding
                     ten years. Insofar as accused A is concerned, it
                     is alleged that he has committed an offence
                     resulting in the death of any person which is
                     punishable with death or imprisonment for life
                     as described in Section 3(1) of the MCOCA.
                     Accordingly, one charge-sheet is filed against
                     him. Insofar as accused B is concerned, it is
                     alleged that he has committed an offence
                     resulting in the death of any person which is
                     punishable with death or imprisonment for life
                     as described in Section 3(2) of the MCOCA.
                     Accordingly, one charge-sheet is filed against
                     him. Likewise, insofar as accused C is
                     concerned, it is alleged that he has committed
                     an offence resulting in the death of any person
                     which is punishable with death or
                     imprisonment for life as described in Section
                     3(3) of the MCOCA. Accordingly, one charge-
                     sheet is filed against him. Finally, it is alleged
                     that accused D is a member of organized crime
                     syndicate as described in Section 3(4) of the
                     MCOCA and as such has indulged in
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                                Page no.11

                     organized crime and against whom also one
                     charge-sheet is filed.
                     39. The submission on behalf of the appellant
                     is that even though all the four accused
                     namely, A, B, C and D may be members of the
                     organized crime syndicate since against each
                     of the accused not more than one chargesheet
                     is filed, it cannot be held that they are engaged
                     in     continuing      unlawful     activity   as
                     contemplated under Section 2(1)(d) of the
                     MCOCA. Apart from the reasons which we
                     have given hereinabove as to why such a
                     construction is not possible, having regard to
                     the object with which the MCOCA was
                     enacted, namely to make special provisions for
                     prevention and control of organized crime
                     syndicate and for coping with criminal activity
                     by organized crime syndicate, in our opinion,
                     Section 2(1)(d) cannot be so construed. Such a
                     construction will defeat the object of the
                     MCOCA. What is contemplated under Section
                     2(1)(d) of the MCOCA is that activities
                     prohibited by law for the time being in force
                     which are punishable as described therein have
                     been undertaken either singly or jointly as a
                     member of organized crime syndicate and in
                     respect of which more than one charge-sheets
                     have been filed. Stress is on the unlawful
                     activities committed by the organized crime
                     syndicate. Requirement of one or more charge-
                     sheet is qua the unlawful activities of the
                     organized crime syndicate.” (Emphasis
                     supplied)
15.        The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in a judgment titled ‘Prasad
Shrikant Purohit v. State of Maharashtra, 2015 Supreme Court
Cases 440, has also observed in Para 66 as follows:
                     “In this respect, we will have to bear in mind
                     that the implication of MCOCA would come
                     into play only after the third occurrence takes
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                               Page no.12

                     place and only after that it will have to be seen
                     whether on the earlier two such occasions
                     involvement of someone jointly or singly,
                     either as a member of an 'organized crime
                     syndicate' or on its behalf indulged in a crime
                     in respect of which a charge-sheet has already
                     been filed before the Competent Court which
                     Court had taken cognizance of such offence.”
16.        Similarly Hon‟ble Supreme Court in another judgment
‘Brijesh Singh @ Arun Kumar And Anr., (2017) 10 Supreme
Court Cases 779 has also held as under;
                     „25. Organised crime which is an offence
                     punishable under Section 3 of MCOCA means
                     a continuing unlawful activity committed by
                     the use of force or violence for economic gain.
                     One relevant pre-condition which has to be
                     satisfied before any activity can be considered
                     as a continuing unlawful activity is that there
                     should be at least two charge sheets filed
                     against the members of an organised crime
                     syndicate within the previous 10 years and a
                     competent Court has taken cognizance of such
                     charge sheets‟.
17.        Perusal of the above judgments reveal that the requirement of
one or more chargesheet relates to unlawful activities of the
organized crime syndicate and does not pertain to a particular
member of the crime syndicate accused. The contention of Ld.
Counsel for the petitioner that in the absence of two chargesheet
against the petitioner, he could not have been charged with
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                               Page no.13

MCOCA and he be released on bail is, therefore, not in consonance
with law.
18.        Section 21(4) of the MCOC Act contemplates the factors on
the basis of which accused is entitled to bail and the same runs as
follows;
                     "(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the
                     Code, no person accused of an offence
                     punishable under this Act shall, if in custody,
                     be released on bail or on his own bond, unless-
                     (a) the Public Prosecutor has been given an
                     opportunity to oppose the application of such
                     release; and
                     (b) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the
                     application, the Court is satisfied that there are
                     reasonable grounds for believing that he is not
                     guilty of such offence and that he is not likely
                     to commit any offence while on bail."
19.        The Hon'ble Supreme Court has interpreted the above
provisions in ‘State of Maharashtra v. Vishwanath Maranna
Shetty, (2013) 1 SCC (Cri) 105’ in Para 29 has held as follows:
                     "Since the respondent has been charged with
                     the offence under MCOCA, while dealing with
                     his application for grant of bail, in addition to
                     the broad principles to be applied in
                     prosecution for the offences under IPC, the
                     relevant provision in the said statute, namely,
                     sub-section (4) of Section 21 has to be kept in
                     mind. It is also further made clear that a bare
                     reading of the non obstante clause in sub-
                     section (4) of Section 21 of MCOCA that the
                     power to grant bail to a person accused of
                     having committed offence under the said Act
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                                Page no.14

                     is not only subject to the limitations imposed
                     under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal
                     Procedure, 1973 but also subject to the
                     restrictions placed by clauses (a) and (b) of
                     sub-section (4) of Section 21. Apart from
                     giving an opportunity to the prosecutor to
                     oppose the application for such release, the
                     other twin conditions viz. (i) the satisfaction of
                     the court that there are reasonable grounds for
                     believing that the accused is not guilty of the
                     alleged offence; and (ii) that he is not likely to
                     commit any offence while on bail, have to be
                     satisfied. The satisfaction contemplated in
                     clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (4) of
                     Section 21 regarding the accused being not
                     guilty, has to be based on "reasonable
                     grounds". Though the expression "reasonable
                     grounds" has not been defined in the Act, it is
                     presumed that it is something more than prima
                     facie grounds. We reiterate that recording of
                     satisfaction on both the aspects mentioned in
                     clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (4) of
                     Section 21 is sine qua non for granting bail
                     under MCOCA."
19.        Let us examine the present bail application in view of the
above law laid down by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. Perusal of the
material brought on record reveals involvement of petitioner
Digvijay Saroha to the effect that he has been a part of organized
crime syndicate and has knowingly facilitated the alleged organized
crime syndicate. The MCOCA does not contemplate that the
petitioner should have direct role to play as regards the commission
of an organised crime. If there is a nexus of the petitioner who is a
member of an „organised crime syndicate‟, or nexus with the
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                                Page no.15

offence in the nature of an „organised crime‟ is established, the
petitioner will prima facie satisfy the ingredients of Section 3(2) of
MCOCA. In the present case, the petitioner Digvijay Saroha is
alleged to be a member of an organized crime syndicate run by
Jitender @ Gogi. There are approximately 27 cases filed against
this organized crime syndicate. As per reply filed by the
prosecution, there is confessional statement of co-accused Yogesh,
which reveals that petitioner Digvijay Saroha is the member of an
organized crime syndicate being run by Jitender @ Gogi. It has also
come on record that during interrogation petitioner/ accused
Digvijay Saroha has disclosed that he is an active member of
Jitender @ Gogi Gang and used to collect information regarding
members of opposite gang as well suspected targets from whom
money can be extorted. During the investigation one witness
namely Ms. Nikita Dahiya has deposed that this 'Orgainised Crime
Syndicate' used to collect extortion money from her and accused
Digvijay Saroha is one of the associates of this gang, who used to
collect protection money from her. Thus, Prima facie, the
prosecution has established petitioner‟s role in conspiring, assisting
Bail Appl. No. 1638/2019                                       Page no.16

and managing the crime syndicate. There are no reasonable grounds
to believe that petitioner is not guilty of the offences, he has been
charged with. On the contrary, the material brought on record,
points to his role in the abetment of the offences committed by the
crime syndicate.
21.        In view of the above discussion and keeping in mind serious
nature of allegations and the fact that if the petitioner is released on
bail, he may temper with the witnesses and the evidence and may
even commit other offences, no grounds for bail are made out.
22.        For all the aforesaid reasons, the present bail application is
dismissed.
