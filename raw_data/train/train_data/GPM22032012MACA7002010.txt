        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.P.MITTAL
                             JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J. (ORAL)
1.      These two Appeals preferred by the Oriental Insurance
        Company Limited arise out of a common judgment dated
        14.07.2010 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the
        Claims Tribunal).
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                       Page 1 of 13

2.      MAC APP.700/2010 relates to the grant of compensation of
        `70,000/- to the first Respondent for having suffered injuries in
        an accident which occurred on 3.02.2005.
3.      In MAC APP.701/2010 a compensation of `24,63,024/- was
        awarded to Respondents No.1 to 5 who were the legal
        representatives of deceased Satbir who was working as a Head
        Constable in Delhi Police at the relevant time.
4.      During the course of arguments, a very short submission has
        been made on behalf of the Appellant.
5.      It is urged that second Respondent Sanjeev @ Bobby (the
        driver) in MAC APP.700/2010 and sixth Respondent in MAC
        APP.701/2010 did not possess a valid driving licence at the time
        of the accident. At the time of registration of the case under
        Section 279/338/304-A IPC, the driver was also challaned for
        driving the vehicle without a licence.
6.      During the course of inquiry, the driver came out with a plea
        that he did not possess a driving licence as he was working only
        as a helper on RTV bearing number DL-IV-1152. It is urged
        that the Insurance Company discharged its onus of proving
        conscious breach on the part of the owner (Krishan Kumar). In
        spite of this, the liability was fastened on the Appellant to pay
        the compensation awarded and even the recovery rights were
        declined.
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                        Page 2 of 13

7.      Learned counsel for the Appellant contends that in view of the
        clear admission of the driver that he did not possess any driving
        licence, nothing more was required to be proved by the
        Appellant to establish a willful breach of the terms of the
        Insurance policy by the Insured. The Appellant was, therefore,
        entitled to at least grant of recovery rights.
8.      On the other hand, it is urged by the learned counsel for Krishan
        Kumar (the Insured) that the driver did possess a valid driving
        licence from the year 2004 to 2007. It was amply proved during
        inquiry before the Claims Tribunal that the driver told a lie with
        oblique motive that he was not driving the vehicle at the time of
        the accident although, this was amply proved from the
        testimony of PW-3 Naresh (an eye witness) and R2W2 Krishan
        Kumar, the Insured.
9.      The Claims Tribunal dealt with this question at great length in
        Paras 42 to 65 of the impugned judgment, which are extracted
        hereunder:-
             “42. In the preset case the plea of R1 is that he was not
             driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. He
             was in his village. When examined under Section 15
             Evidence Act, he stated that he does not have any driving
             license. He had never issued any driving license. He had
             never applied for it.
             43. The plea of R2 is that it was R1 who was driving the
             offending vehicle at the time of accident. He was having
             a valid driving license.
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                         Page 3 of 13

             44. R3 wants to take the benefit of the dispute between R1
             and R2. Since R1 has specifically denied his having any
             driving license on the date of accident or his having ever
             applied for issuance of the license, R3 on the basis of his
             (R1’s) statement wants to wriggle out of its liability to
             pay the compensation.
             45. First of all, I will try to deal with the question as to
             who was driving the vehicle at the time of accident.
             46. Constable Naresh PW3 in the cross examination of
             R2 has admitted the suggestion that R1, who was present
             on that day in the court, was the driver of the offending
             vehicle. He (PW3) had volunteered, he (R1) was driving
             the vehicle at the time of accident. This witness was cross
             examined by Ld. Counsel for R1. It was not suggested to
             him that R1 was not driving the offending vehicle at the
             time of accident or that he was in his village. The witness
             denied the suggestion that he had not seen the driver at
             the place of accident. The witness deposed that after the
             accident, the driver had tried to flee away from the spot
             and in that process he had seen him while he (R1) was
             getting down from the offending vehicle and his face was
             towards them (witness). It is well settled that if a
             particular fact asserted by a witness is not tested in the
             cross examination, that particular fact will have to be
             taken to have been accepted by the opposite side.
             47. A notice under Section 133 MV Act dated 24.02.2005
             was issued to R2. The certified copy of the notice is on
             record. R2 had given it in writing that at the time of
             accident R1 was driving the offending vehicle. This fact
             has been stated on oath by R2 when he appeared as
             R2W2.
             48. R1 has not appeared to refute the claim of PW3 and
             R2W2. An adverse inference shall have to be drawn
             against him. The facts were within his personal
             knowledge, therefore, it was for him to state those facts
             on oath to believer the claim of W3 and R2 W2. R2 would
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                           Page 4 of 13

             not have given in writing on 24.02.2005 itself that it was
             R1 who was driving the offending vehicle at the time of
             accident. By naming a person not having a valid DL at
             the time of accident would have been suicidal involving
             his RTV had taken place, there was every likelihood of
             filing of the claim petitions by the injured/LRs of the
             deceased. He would not have himself invited the
             trouble/liability. The defence of R1 has come, in writing,
             for the first time, in shape of the written statement dated
             16.04.2007. The plea of R2 is therefore, consistent.
             Therefore, I hold that the offending bus was being driven
             by R1 at the time of accident.
             49. It brings me to the crucial question as to who, in the
             circumstances of the case, is liable to pay the
             compensation.
             50. R2 has appeared as R2W2 and in his examination in
             chief he has stated that when R1 had come to him for
             employment, he had verified his credentials. He has
             personally seen him driving another vehicle bearing
             No.DLIVA1187 prior to joining his service. At that time
             he (witness) had also seen the DL of R1 which was
             produced by him. He had also seen the name of the
             accused (R1) as well as the validity of DL. He had also
             seen the DL and satisfied himself that R1 was authorized
             to drive the commercial vehicle. After appointing R1, he
             had personally seen the manner in which R1 used to
             drive his (witness’s) vehicle. He was told by R1 that he
             was not having any criminal case. However, he (R1) had
             told him that he was having traffic challan against him.
             The witness further deposed that he was having a valid
             permit for plying this vehicle.
             51. The witness (R2W2) was not cross examined on
             behalf of petitioner(s). Statement of this witness was
             recorded on 17.09.2009. R1 was present on that day.
             However, he did not put any question to the witness. On
             that very day R1 was examined under Section 165
             Evidence Act. In the cross examination of R3, the witness
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                          Page 5 of 13

             deposed that he had verified the DL of R1, which, at that
             time was valid from the year 2004 till 2007. The witness
             denied the suggestion that R1 was not having any driving
             license or that he (witness) had not verified the DL or R1.
             The witness further deposed that he was not challenged
             or charge-sheeted for offence under Section 5/80 MV.
             Act.
             52. R2, in order to prove the fact that R1 was having a
             license, has examined constable Jai Ram IR2W3) and Sh.
             Rakesh Hooda (R2W4).
             53. Ct. Jai Ram, R2W3 had produced the record of
             challans of the vehicles. As per the record, vehicle No.
             DL4A1187 was challaned on 15.10.2004. The challan
             was issued to the driver Sanjeev Kumar s/o Jai Prakash.
             At the time of issuance of this challan, the DL of Sanjeev
             Kumar was impounded. Copy of the challan is mark A.
             Copy of the relevant entry of the register is Ex.R2W3/A.
             54. This witness (R2W3) was not cross examined at all
             on behalf of R1, though an opportunity to cross examine
             had been afforded to his counsel. In the cross
             examination of R3, the witness deposed that he was not in
             a position to say as to whether the DL, which was
             impounded in this case was fake. The witness admitted
             that in the register neither the name of the authority
             which had issued the DL nor the date on which it was
             issued, was mentioned. The witness was not cross
             examined on behalf of the petitioner (s).
             55. Sh. Rakesh Hooda, R2W4, who was owner of
             DLIVA1187, which was challenged on 15.10.2004,
             deposed that he knows R1 as he had earlier worked with
             him as driver and had driven his vehicle. At the time
             when R1 came to him for employment, he had seen his
             driving license. He had not retained the copy of DL. R1
             had worked with him for about one year. During his
             tenure, R1 had driven his (witness’s) vehicle diligently
             and had not caused any accident except a traffic challan
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                           Page 6 of 13

             issued on 15.10.2004. He then identified R1 who was
             present in the court on that day.
             56. This witness (R2W4) was also not cross examined on
             behalf of R1 though an opportunity to cross examine the
             witness had been afforded to the counsel for R1. In the
             cross examination conducted on behalf of R3 the witness
             denied the suggestion that R1 had never worked with him
             (witness) or that he was shown to him outside the court
             or that he (R1) had not shown any license or that he
             (witness) had deposed at the instance of R2.
             57. The entry Ex.R2W3/A is dated 15.10.2004. On that
             day R2W4 could not have even imagined that an accident
             of the offending vehicle would take place on 23.02.2005.
             In the challan copy of which is mark A, which has been
             proved by R2W3, name of R1 finds mentioned. The
             number of the challan book 575237 finds mentioned in
             Ex.R2W3/A. This number could not have been mentioned
             in the absence of the actual challan. The challenging
             authority would not have known on 15.10.2004 that this
             driver (R1) would be required to answer as to whether he
             (R1) was having a DL or not. R2W3 has categorically
             stated that at the time of issuance of the challan, DL of
             Sanjeev Kumar was impounded. Thus, there is an over
             whelming evidence that Sanjeev Kumar s/o Jai Prakash
             had been challaned on 15.10.2004 and his DL had been
             seized by the police.
             58. The question arises as to whether the person arrayed
             as R1 is the same who had been challaned on 15.10.2004
             and in respect of whom the evidence has been produced
             by R2.
             59. As mentioned earlier, R1 has not appeared. He could
             have appeared and stated it on oath that he never been
             challaned. He could have stated on oath that he had
             never worked with R2W4. It is his plea that he had
             worked as helper on the vehicle of R2 and due to non-
             payment of his salary for two months, he (R1) had left the
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                         Page 7 of 13

             job, before the alleged accident. Thus it is not the plea of
             R1 that he does not know R2 at all. Therefore, in view of
             the nature of evidence, I hold that R1 is the same person
             who was challaned on 15.10.2004.
             60. It is the plea of R1 that he had never applied for Dl.
             He did not have any DL. As against this plea, we have
             the evidence of R2W2, R2W3 and R2W4. Once a finding
             on the basis of the evidence to the effect that R1 is the
             same person who had been challaned on 15.10.2004, is
             arrived at, it can be said that the plea put forth by R1 is
             unbelievable. He had not been paid the salary by R2. It
             could have been the reason for him to come out with such
             a plea to create problem for R2.
             61. R2 has substantiated his defence by appearing as a
             witness and examining R2W3 and R2W4. R1 cannot be
             permitted to defeat the plea of R2. In such like cases, as
             the present one, where satisfactory evidence has been
             produced by the owner, his (owner’s) interest will have
             to be safe guarded otherwise a disgruntled driver, for
             obvious reasons, would, in order to achieve his illegal
             design, deny his having DL on the date of accident. In the
             present case R1 is facing trial in the criminal case. He
             has been challaned under Sections 279/338/304IPC read
             with Section 3/181 MV Act. The trial has not been
             concluded as yet. He wants to put forth a formidable
             defence. During investigation he had been arrested. He
             had refused to join the TIP. This is evident from the
             report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. certified that copy of
             which is Ex.R3W1/F. R2 has not been challenged under
             Section 5/180 of MV Act.
             62. I am conscious of that fact that in some cases owners
             of the vehicles, in order to avoid liability, produce a
             person having a valid DL and assert that at the time of
             accident the vehicle was being driven by him though in
             fact that vehicle had been driven by a person not having
             a valid DL. It would never be vice verse. But then in
             those cases the tribunal will be required to appreciate the
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                           Page 8 of 13

             facts in the light of the evidence produced in those cases.
             As mentioned earlier, whatever may be the reason for R2
             to say that R1 was the driver of the offending vehicle at
             the time of accident, he would not have, at least invited
             the trouble to pay the compensation.
             63. Since, we do not have the DL of R1, therefore, the
             question of its being fake or otherwise does not arise.
             64. In the circumstances of the case, in view of the nature
             of evidence and the observations made by the Hon’ble
             Supreme Court in Lal Chand Vs. OIC (2006) SCCR 967,
             I am inclined to accept the plea of R2 that R1 was the
             driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and
             he was having a valid DL. The claim of R2 finds
             necessary corroboration from the statements of R2W3
             and R2W4.
             65. In view of the above discussion it is held that R1 was
             driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. He
             is the principal tort feaser. Admittedly the offending
             vehicle was owned by R2 and insured with R3, therefore,
             they are held vicariously liable. All the respondents are
             held jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded
             amount. In view of nature of evidence and findings, R3
             cannot escape the liability. The awarded amount be paid
             by R3”.
10.     On the basis of the evidence adduced by the Respondent Naresh
        Kumar and the owner Krishan Kumar, it was clearly established
        that Sanjeev was driving RTV No.DL-IV-1152 at the time of
        the accident. As noticed by the Claims Tribunal, testimony of
        PW-3 Naresh Kumar that Sanjeev was driving the vehicle at the
        time of the accident was not challenged in his (PW-3’s) cross-
        examination.        Similarly, testimony of the owner, Krishan
        Kumar, who entered the witness box as R2W2, that Sanjeev
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                           Page 9 of 13

        was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident was not
        challenged. The Insured also examined Constable Jai Ram
        (R2W3). He deposed that a challan was issued against Sanjeev
        Kumar for violating the guidelines laid down by the Supreme
        Court.        The relevant entry of the challan was proved as
        Ex.R2W3/A. His testimony was also not challenged by the
        driver.
11.     In these circumstances, it was established on record that
        Sanjeev Kumar was driving the offending vehicle at the time of
        the accident.       Thus, the driver’s plea that he was simply
        working as a helper on the RTV bearing No. DL-IV-1152; that
        there was some dispute with regard to the payment of wages
        between him and the owner and that he was falsely involved in
        the accident case was rightly rejected by the Claims Tribunal.
12.     It was also proved by R2W4 Rakesh Huda’s testimony that the
        driver Sanjeev Kumar had worked with him as a driver on his
        RTV No.DL-1VA-1187 and that he was also challaned by the
        traffic police on 15.10.2004 vide challan mark A which also
        shows that the driver had put up a totally false case that he was
        working merely as a helper on the RTV involved in the
        accident. It is amply proved that he was working as a driver on
        the RTV not only on the date of the accident but even prior
        thereto.
13.     It is well settled that the onus is on the Insurance Company to
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                        Page 10 of 13

        prove that there was willful breach of the terms of the policy as
        envisaged under Section 149 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (the
        Act).
14.     In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Lehru and Ors., (2003) 3
        SCC 338 while relying on Skandia Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
        Kokilaben Chandravadan and Ors., (1987) 2 SCC 654 and
        Sohan Lal Passi v. P. Sesh Reddy & Ors, (1996) 5 SCC 21 the
        Supreme Court held as under: -
             “18. Now let us consider Section 149(2). Reliance has
             been placed on Section 149(2)(a)(ii). As seen, in order to
             avoid liability under this provision it must be shown that
             there is a “breach”. As held in Skandia and Sohan Lal
             Passi cases the breach must be on the part of the insured.
             We are in full agreement with that. To hold otherwise
             would lead to absurd results. Just to take an example,
             suppose a vehicle is stolen. Whilst it is being driven by
             the thief there is an accident. The thief is caught and it is
             ascertained that he had no licence. Can the insurance
             company disown liability? The answer has to be an
             emphatic “No”. To hold otherwise would be to negate
             the very purpose of compulsory insurance. The injured
             or relatives of the person killed in the accident may find
             that the decree obtained by them is only a paper decree
             as the owner is a man of straw. The owner himself would
             be an innocent sufferer. It is for this reason that the
             legislature, in its wisdom, has made insurance, at least
             third-party insurance, compulsory. The aim and purpose
             being that an insurance company would be available to
             pay. The business of the company is insurance. In all
             businesses there is an element of risk. All persons
             carrying on business must take risks associated with that
             business. Thus it is equitable that the business which is
             run for making profits also bears the risk associated with
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                           Page 11 of 13

             it. At the same time innocent parties must not be made to
             suffer or loss. These provisions meet these requirements.
             We are thus in agreement with what is laid down in the
             aforementioned cases viz. that in order to avoid liability
             it is not sufficient to show that the person driving at the
             time of accident was not duly licensed. The insurance
             company must establish that the breach was on the part
             of the insured.”
15.     I have already held above that Sanjeev Kumar was driving not
        only the RTV involved in the accident but the RTV No.DL-
        IVA-1187 owned by R2W4 almost four months prior to the
        accident.
16.     R2W4 with whom Sanjeev Kumar worked as a driver, deposed
        that when he (Sanjeev Kumar) came to him for employment he
        had seen his driving licence. He stated that Sanjeev Kumar
        drove the vehicle diligently during the course of his
        employment with him.           The owner of the vehicle (Krishan
        Kumar) R2W2 deposed that at the time Sanjeev Kumar came to
        him for employment, he verified his credential personally, saw
        him driving another vehicle and also found out that he had a
        valid driving licence to drive a commercial vehicle.                 He
        personally saw Krishan Kumar driving his vehicle.
17.     The Claims Tribunal rightly came to the conclusion that in
        order to settle his personal score, Sanjeev Kumar (the driver)
        took the plea that he was working merely as a helper and did not
        possess any driving licence. There was no reason for the owner
        of the RTV to have falsely named a person not having a driving
MAC APP 700/2010 Etc.                                          Page 12 of 13

        licence as the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident,
        knowing fully well the consequences that he himself would be
        liable to pay the compensation to the legal representatives.
18.     In the circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the
        Insurance Company discharged the onus placed on it. Rather,
        there is ample evidence to show that the owner took all
        precautions to see that the vehicle is driven by a duly licensed
        person. Non-production of the driving licence for the reasons
        stated hereinabove would not mean that the owner committed
        breach of the terms of the policy.
19.     The Appeals are devoid of any merit; the same are accordingly
        dismissed.
20.     No costs.
