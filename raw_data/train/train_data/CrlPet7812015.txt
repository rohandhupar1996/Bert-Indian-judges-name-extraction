16.07.2013 pertaining to said Diphu P.S. Case also reveals that the informant
went to the Principal of said Government College to inform him regarding
irregular holding of Economic classes in the said College and during which the
alleged incident occurred. Apparently, the alleged incident in said Diphu P.S.

appear in the said G.R. Case No.477/2013 arising out of said Diphu P.S. Case
No. 105/2013.
14.      It is seen that the FIR dated 16.07.2013 pertaining to said Diphu P.S.
Case No. 105/2013, lodged by the informant/respondent No. 2 does not contain
any ingredients of either Section 294 or 323 IPC. Moreover, the Chargesheet
No. 49/2013 filed on 31.08.2013 in said Diphu P.S. Case No. 105/2013,
annexed to the petition also does not disclose any material consisting of the
ingredients of said Section 294 or 323 IPC.
15.      Considering the entire aspect of the matter, the order of taking
cognizance of the offences under Sections 294/323 IPC against the present
petitioner in said Diphu P.S. Case No.105/2013 corresponding to G.R. Case No.
