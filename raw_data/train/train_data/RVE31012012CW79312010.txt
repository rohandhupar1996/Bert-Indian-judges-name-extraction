HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.V. EASWAR
SANJIV KHANNA,J: (ORAL)
       Artech Infosystems (P) Ltd. has filed the present petition
challenging re-assessment proceedings u/s 147 and 148 of the
Income Tax Act (for short Act) initiated for the Assessment Year
2003-04 vide notice dated 22.03.2010.      The petitioner has also
impugned the order dated 18.11.2010 passed by the Assessing
Officer disposing of and dismissing the objections filed by the
WP(C)No.7931/10                                       Page 1 of 12

petitioner to the reassessment proceedings in terms of the order
passed by the Supreme Court in the GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd.
Vs. CIT (2003) 259 ITR 19 (SC).
2.     The “reasons to belief” recorded by the Assessing Officer
dated 19.03.2010 read as under:-
               “The Return of Income for the AY 2003-04 was
               filed on 28.11.2003 declaring a loss of
               Rs.10,28,887/- and subsequently assessed u/s
               143(3) dated 16.03.2006 at a loss of
               Rs.6,45,338/-.
               On perusal of astt records, and P&L A/cs an
               amount of Rs.2,12,31,472/- was shown payment
               towards software consultation overseas (M/s
               Artex Information System LLC) and was remitted
               to foreign company without deducting tax at
               source. However, during the asstt proceedings
               the assessee stated that payment made for
               consultancy services outside India are not
               chargeable under this act. As per clause (vii) of
               sub section (i) of Section 9, this clause is not
               applicable to assessee company in this case
               because as per 3 CD report (Sl. No.28a)
               assessee had neither any sale of software
               outside nor earn any income from outside India
               and consumed all software in house. Therefore,
               the consultancy charges paid to foreign
               company was to be disallowed and added back
               in the taxable income of the assessee.
               In view of the above, I have reason to believe
               that an amount to the extent mentioned above
               chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for
               the assessment year 2003-04 and, hence,
               clearly attracts the provisions of 147 of the IT
WP(C)No.7931/10                                            Page 2 of 12

               Act. Therefore, notice u/s 148 of the Act is to be
               issued. Put up for statutory approval of the Ld.
               CIT, Delhi-I, New Delhi u/s 151 of the IT Act.”
               (emphasis supplied)
3.     The respondent along with the counter affidavit have filed
copy of the order sheet dated 20.02.2006 and the reply furnished
by the petitioner vide letter dated 06.03.2006.
4.     Query No. 9 raised in the order dated 20.02.2006 reads as
under:-
               “Details of payments made to “Artech Info
               Systems LLC‟ for cost incurred on behalf of
               Softek. Give “bank certificates” & „bank
               statement‟ showing the same. If no payment
               made till now, why same be allowed as an
               expense”
The response given by the respondent/assessee to the said query
vide letter dated 06.03.2006 is as under:-
                      “Q 7. TDS detail on Payment made to
               the Artect information Systems LLC for the
               expenditures incurred on behalf of the Softek
                      It is submitted that the payment made for
               Consultancy Services outside India are not
               chargeable under this Act as per the clause (vii)
               of the sub section (1) of Section 9 which is
               reproduced as under:
                      “income by way of fees for technical
               services payable by
               (a)    the Govt; or
               (b)    a person who is a resident, except where
WP(C)No.7931/10                                              Page 3 of 12

               the fees are payable in respect of services
               utilized in a business or profession carried on by
               such person outside India or for the purpose of
               making or earning any income from any source
               outside India; or
               (c)    a person who is a non-resident, where the
               fees are payable in respect of services utilized in
               a business or profession carried on by such
               person in India or for the purpose of making or
               earning any income from any source in India”
               As per clause (b) above, these services are
               utilized in the business and profession outside
               India and hence not chargeable under this Act.
               It is submitted that these Payment are for
               reimbursement of expenditures incurred by
               Artect LLC on behalf of the assessee company
               and hence paid on actual.”
5.     It is clear from the aforesaid query and the answer that during
the course of the original assessment proceedings, the Assessing
Officer had gone into the question whether or not Section 9(1)(vii) of
the Act was applicable to payment made by the petitioner to Artex
Information Systems LLC.           The Assessing Officer did not invoke
Section 9(1)(vii) and was satisfied with the reply furnished by the
petitioner/assessee.         In the present case admittedly the re-
assessment proceedings have been initiated and the Revenue has
not taken the recourse to Section 263 of the Act. Dealing with the
scope and ambit of Section 147 of the Act and the validity of initiation
of reassessment proceedings, in the case of CIT vs. Kelvinator of
India Ltd. (2002) 256 ITR 1 (Del), it has been observed as under:-
WP(C)No.7931/10                                              Page 4 of 12

               “From a bare perusal of the provisions contained
               in section 147 of the said Act, as it stood up to
               March 31, 1989, it is evident that to confer
               jurisdiction under section 147(a) of the Act two
               conditions were required to be satisfied, viz., (1)
               the Assessing Officer must have reason to
               believe that income charge- able to tax has
               escaped assessment ; and (2) he must also have
               a reason to        believe that such escapement
               occurred by reason of either ; (a) omission or
               failure on the part of the assessee to make a
               return of his income under section 139 or (b)
               omission or failure on the part of the assessee to
               disclose fully and        truly all material facts
               necessary for his assessment for that year. The
               afore- mentioned requirements of law must be
               held to be conditions precedent for invoking
               jurisdiction of the Assessing Officer to reopen the
               assessment under section 147 of the said Act. It
               is trite that both the conditions aforementioned
               are cumulative. It is also a well-settled principle of
               law that, in the event it is found that any of the
               said two conditions is not fulfilled the notice
               issued by the Assessing Officer would be wholly
               without jurisdiction. The expression “reason to
               believe” finds place both in clauses (a) and (b) of
               section 147 of the Act. Sub-section (2) of section
               148 of the Act mandates that before jurisdiction
               under section 147 of the Act is invoked by the
               Assessing Officer he is to record his reasons for
               doing so or before issuing any notice under
               section 147 of the said Act. Therefore, formation
               of reason to believe and recording of reasons
               were imperative before the Assessing Officer
               could reopen a completed assessment. Since
               assessment has been reopened on April 20,
               1990, section 147 as amended with effect from
               April 1, 1989, would apply.
WP(C)No.7931/10                                                Page 5 of 12

                What would constitute “reason to believe” is no
               longer res integra.”
6.     The aforesaid decision was taken in appeal to the Supreme
Court     and      was    dismissed    by    the  decision     reported   in
Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi v. Kelvinator of India
Limited, (2010) 320 ITR 723(SC). The Supreme Court in the said
decision has observed as under:-
               “On going through the changes, quoted above,
               made to Section 147 of the Act, we find that, prior
               to the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987,
               reopening could be done under the above two
               conditions and fulfilment of the said conditions
               alone conferred jurisdiction on the assessing
               officer to make a back assessment, but in Section
               147 of the Act (with effect from 1-4-1989), they
               are given a go-by and only one condition has
               remained viz. that where the assessing officer
               has reason to believe that income has escaped
               assessment, confers jurisdiction to reopen the
               assessment. Therefore, post-1-4-1989, power to
               reopen is much wider. However, one needs to
               give a schematic interpretation to the words
               “reason to believe” failing which, we are afraid,
               Section 147 would give arbitrary powers to the
               assessing officer to reopen assessments on the
               basis of “mere change of opinion”, which cannot
               be per se reason to reopen.
                We must also keep in mind the conceptual
               difference between power to review and power to
               reassess. The assessing officer has no power to
               review; he has the power to reassess. But
               reassessment has to be based on fulfillment of
               certain precondition and if the concept of “change
               of opinion” is removed, as contended on behalf of
WP(C)No.7931/10                                              Page 6 of 12

               the Department, then, in the garb of reopening
               the assessment, review would take place.
                 One must treat the concept of “change of
               opinion” as an in-built test to check abuse of
               power by the assessing officer. Hence, after 1-4-
               1989, the assessing officer has power to reopen,
               provided there is “tangible material” to come to
               the conclusion that there is escapement of
               income from assessment. Reasons must have a
               live link with the formation of the belief. Our view
               gets support from the changes made to Section
               147 of the Act, as quoted hereinabove. Under the
               Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987,
               Parliament not only deleted the words “reason to
               believe” but also inserted the word “opinion” in
               Section 147 of the Act. However, on receipt of
               representations from the companies against
               omission of the words “reason to believe”,
               Parliament reintroduced the said expression and
               deleted the word “opinion” on the ground that it
               would vest arbitrary powers in the assessing
               officer.”
7.     In view of the aforesaid legal position it is clear that the
present case is of change of opinion and the Assessing Officer in
the first/original assessment proceedings had gone into and
examined the said question but accepted the stand of the
petitioner.       A wrong/incorrect opinion cannot be corrected in
147/148 proceedings but if the decision is erroneous and
prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue, it can be corrected in
proceedings under Section 263 of the Act. The Full Bench of the
Delhi High Court in Kelvinator of India Limited had observed as
WP(C)No.7931/10                                               Page 7 of 12

under:-
               “It is well settled principle of law that what cannot
               be done directly cannot be done indirectly. If the
               Income-tax Officer does not possess the power of
               review, he cannot be permitted to achieve the
               said object by taking recourse to initiating a
               proceeding of reassessment or by way of
               rectification of mistake. In a case of this nature
               the Revenue is not without remedy. Section 263
               of the Act empowers the Commissioner to review
               an order which is prejudicial to the Revenue.”
       Reopening under Section 147 and 148 of the Act is not
permissible on change of opinion. We may record here that the
“reasons to believe” recorded on 19.03.2010 themselves clearly
indicate that the issue/question was examined in the original
proceedings.
8.     The learned counsel for the petitioner has also drawn our
attention to the order dated 18.11.2010 passed by the Assessing
Officer rejecting objections. The Assessing Officer in this order has
held as under:-
               “And further in the case of CIT Vs. P.V.S.
               Beedies P. Ltd. (SC) 237 ITR 13 it was held by
               Hon‟ble Supreme Court that position of Law
               pointed by Internal Audit Party-reopening on that
               basis is valid. Therefore, the contention of the
               assessee that reopening is based on change of
               opinion has no force and not sustainable.”
9.     The petitioner has rightly submitted that the Assessing Officer
has misread the judgment of Supreme Court in CIT Vs. P.V.S.
WP(C)No.7931/10                                                Page 8 of 12

Beedies P. Ltd. (SC) (1999) 237 ITR 13. In the said case it has
been held that opinion of the audit party on a point of law cannot be
regarded as information under Section 147(b) and cannot lead to
valid initiation of the assessment proceedings. A factual mistake or
a fact missed stands on a different footing. In the present case in
the order dated 18.11.2010, it has not been alleged that the audit
party had pointed out any factual aspect, that was missed and not
taken into account by the Assessing Officer.
10.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has also submitted that the
second portion of the reasons recorded, which refers to Form
No.3CD(i.e. the audit report) serial No. 28(a) is factually incorrect.
He has filed before us a copy of the audit report in Form No. 3CD,
which is taken on record, the relevant portion of Sl.No.28(a) reads
as under:-
       “28     (a)   In the case of a trading concern      Micrografx
                     Give quantitative details of
                     principal items of goods traded:
                     (i) opening stock                     173
                     (ii) purchases during the             NIL
                         previous year
                     (iii) sales during the          138 (Software used
                         previous year               in house, hence
                                                     capitalized)
                     (iv) closing stock              Nil
                     (v) shortage/excess             35(Written Off)
                         if any”
11.    It is apparent from the reading of the aforesaid paragraph
28(a), that the same relates to the software purchase from the
WP(C)No.7931/10                                              Page 9 of 12

Micrografx. This does not pertain to transaction or the payment
made by the petitioner to M/s Artech Information Sys. LLC.
12.    We may also note that the in respect of software purchase
from Micrografx, the Assessing Officer in the order sheet dated
22.02.2006 has asked the petitioner to explain:-
                      “In audit report u/s 44AB, clause 28(a)
               shows that 138 items of Micrographic software
               has been used-in-house & 35 items have been
               written off. To give exact nature of the software,
               details of opening stock, parties from whom
               software bought along with evidence (invoice),
               details of payment to those parties. To give
               details, with evidence, regarding capitalization &
               use of the software in house. Justify write-off of
               the softwqare along with evidence. Justify the
               value at which capitalized.”
13.    In response to the said query the petitioner in the
communication dated 06.03.2006 had explained and stated as
under:-
                      “Q.N.2- Details of the            Software

               line is in developing, trading and marketing of

               some Graphic Software from M/s Micrografx
               during the Financial Year 1997-98. Due to
               lesser demand these Software were lying in the
               stock for last many years as immovable stock.
               For better utilization of this immovable Stock, it
               was decided to use some of these products in
               house for the home consumption and hence
               these products were capitalized under the
               grouping of Intangible Assets. Detail of the
               Software Capitalized and the Software written
               off are enclosed for your ready reference. The
               Cost of Acquisition for these Software was taken
               at the purchase cost of the Software. As desired
               by your honor, we are also enclosing the details
               of the Invoice and particulars of the Party from
               whom these Software were purchased. We are
               also enclosing the License Nos. for utilization of
               these Software. The Depreciation calculated on
               these Intangible Assessments have been added
               back in the computation and the Depreciation as
               application on Software i.e. on Computers are
               claimed u/s 32 of the Income Tax Act.
               Computation Sheet as attached with the Form
               3CD is enclosed for your ready reference.
               Out of the above said stock, assessee company
               had written off some of the non movable
               Software valuing of Rs.88568/-, lying in its stock
               for last many years. These software were
               imported during the Financial year 1997-98 and
               were lying non movable since then. As there
               was no demand for these software in the
               market, company had no option but to write off
               these non movable Stock and hence after the
               due approval of the Board of Directors, these
               Software valued at Rs.88568/- were written off
               during the said Assessment year. From the

               above, your honor must have noticed that the
               assessee company has made it all the efforts to
               sale these products by marketing them in the so
               long as possible. These expenditures are purely
               in the nature of business expenditures and
               company had recognized this stock in its books
               of accounts and never claimed the purchase
               cost in past and are allowable u/s 37 of the
               Income Tax Act.”
14.    In view of the aforesaid, it is clear that the Assessing Officer
has proceeded on wrong factual basis also and has incorrectly
recorded the reasons by presuming that Sl.No.28(a) relates to
payment made by the petitioner to Artech Information systems
LLC. whereas the said transaction was in respect of software
purchase from Micrografx.
15.    In view of the aforesaid the present writ petition is allowed
and the re-assessment notice dated 22.03.2010 is quashed.
Impugned order dated 18.11.2010 is also quashed. No costs.
