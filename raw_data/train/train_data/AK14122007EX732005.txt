1.     The decree holder filed this execution petition for execution of
decree dated 11th October, 2004 for recovery of Rs.21,37,394.33 as
principal plus Rs.9,73,729.67 as interest @ 3% per month from 22nd
March, 2004 till the date of realization against the judgment debtor.
2.     The objections being E.A 638/2006 were filed by the judgment
debtor which were dismissed by order dated 11th May, 2007. In an
appeal filed before the Division Bench against the decree being
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                            Page 1 of 11

RFA(OS) No.36/2007 and appeal filed against the dismissal of
objections being EFA(O)S No.10/2007, a consent order was passed
whereby the decree was modified and it was directed that interest
shall be paid @ 18% per annum at simple rate on Rs.10.00 lakh
which shall be calculated with effect from 23rd March, 2001. The
amount of Rs.3.51 lakh paid by the judgment debtor before filing of
the suit was adjusted and further amount of Rs.9.62 lakh was also to
be adjusted first towards interest due.    It was also agreed by the
judgment debtor that the amount shall be paid by him by a demand
draft and consequently a judgment and decree dated 11th October,
2004 in respect of which the above-noted execution petition is
pending was modified. It was also agreed that the amount shall be
paid before 30th July, 2007.
3.     Pursuant to the decree modified by the order dated 29 th May,
2007, a communication was sent on behalf of judgment debtor to the
decree holder dated 15th June, 2007 that on the basis of computation
arrived at pursuant to order dated 29th May, 2007, a sum of
Rs.7,85,819.15 as the balance decreetal amount is due from the
judgment debtor. The decree holder was asked to confirm the this
amount so that the amount could be paid prior to 30 th July, 2007.
The details of calculations were also annexed and the notice.
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                      Page 2 of 11

4.       Consequent thereto, a pay order/manager's cheque bearing
No.029375 dated 26th June, 2007 for a sum of Rs.7,89,800/- drawn
on HDFC Bank, Saket Branch was sent along with a communication
dated 26th June, 2007 by registered post. The judgment debtor has
produced the postal receipt dated 26th June, 2007 issued from Lajpat
Nagar Post Office bearing registered article No.2342 and the
acknowledgment card with the address of the decree holder as
“Mr.G.L. Didwania, 173, Western Avenue, Sainik Farms, Khanpur, N.
Delhi-110062” with the endorsement of receipt of registered article on
28th June, 2007.
5.     The judgment debtor also contended in his communication
dated 26th June, 2007 that in order to deliver the demand draft
personally, the judgment debtor tried to contact Mr.Sukumar
Pattjoshi, Advocate on record for the decree holder, to accept the same
but he remained unavailable and the judgment debtor also tried to
call the decree holder on mobile phone No.9811086400 but the decree
holder could not be contacted as his wife told that the decree holder
had left the cell phone at home. The judgment debtor also contended
in his communication that he had tried to contact Mr.N.K. Jawahar, a
common link between the decree holder and the judgment debtor, so
that the decree holder could accept the payment but the said
gentleman, Mr.Jawahar, had no instructions to accept the said
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                        Page 3 of 11

payment.
6.     The matter came up before the Division Bench in RFA(OS)
No.36/2007 and EFA(OS) No.10/2007 on 30th July, 2007 when the
decree holder contended that he has not received the pay order and
since an application was filed by the judgment debtor for recording
the satisfaction of the decree being EA No.341/2007, the Division
Bench by order dated 30th July, 2007 directed that the single Judge
will record the satisfaction of the decree. The learned Division Bench
passed the following order:-
              “CM Appl. Nos.10013-14/2007 in EFA(OS) No.10/2007 and
              RFA (OS) No.36/2007
              Vide order dated 29.5.2007, judgment and decree dated
              11.10.2004 passed by the learned Single Judge was modified.
              It was a consent order. As per the modified decree, payment
              was to be made by the appellant to the respondent within eight
              weeks. It is averred by the appellant that as per the modified
              decree, amount payable was Rs.7,89,800/- and pay order
              No.029375 dated 26.6.2007 issued by the HDFC Bank Limited,
              Saket Branch, New Delhi, was sent to the respondent by
              registered post. Therefore, prayer made is to treat the decree as
              satisfied. The respondent, who is present in the Court, states
              that he has not received the pay order so far. Since the
              appellant has also filed application before the learned Single
              Judge in the execution petition and it is the learned Single
              Judge who is to, in that petition, record satisfaction of the
              decree, it would be appropriate for the learned Single Judge to
              pass orders on the application filed by the appellant in this
              behalf. We dispose of these applications with the aforesaid
              directions.
7.     On 21st August, 2007, the counsel for decree holder contended
that he does not want to file any reply to EA No.341/2007 which was
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                             Page 4 of 11

filed by the judgment debtor to record the satisfaction of the decreetal
amount in Suit No.CS(OS) No.440/2004 and consequent thereto
execution petition being Ex. No.73/2005. The judgment debtor also
sought time to produce the postal certificate to show that the
registered article sent by the judgment debtor on 26th June, 2007
contending that the pay order/manager's cheque bearing No.029375
dated 26th June, 2007 drawn on HDFC Bank, Saket Branch, New
Delhi for sum of Rs.7,89,800/- was delivered to the decree holder.
8.     During the pendency of the execution petition, a statement was
given by the judgment debtor on 15th June, 2006 that he would not be
transferring his shareholding in M/s.Concept India Pvt. Ltd. and the
immovable properties of the said company. As the decree holder had
been contending that he had not received the draft and the
communication dated 26th June, 2007, another application being EA
No.531/2007 was filed to record the satisfaction of the decree and
permit the judgment debtor to issue stop payment order to the issuing
bank against pay order dated 029375 dated 26th June, 2007 for sum
of Rs.7,89,800/- and for issuance of fresh pay order.
9.     By order dated 22nd October, 2007, the judgment debtor was
allowed to stop the payment of pay order dated 26th June, 2007 and
permitted to obtain another draft and give the same to the decree
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                       Page 5 of 11

holder on the next date of hearing, i.e., 30th October, 2007. On 30th
October, 2007, another draft obtained by the judgment debtor from
the same bank for sum of Rs.7,89,800/- bearing No.031417 drawn on
HDFC Bank Ltd. Dated 26th October, 2007 was given to the decree
holder which was accepted by him without prejudice to his rights and
contentions.
10.    The judgment debtor also offered another sum of Rs.15,000/- in
order to settle all the disputes though he had tendered the pay order
along with the letter dated 26th June, 2007 which was served on the
Decree holder on 28th June, 2007. According to him, the decree stood
satisfied as he had sent the balance decreetal amount in compliance
of the order of Division Bench within time and it was duly received by
the decree holder.      On 30th October, 2007 the counsel for the
judgment debtor did not accept another draft of Rs.15,000/- which
was offered by the judgment debtor without prejudice to his rights
and contentions and sought time to take instructions from the
Judgment Debtor.
11.    On 12th November, 2007, the next date, the decree holder
appeared in person and contended that he was unable to engage the
counsel as he is unable to pay his fee and he sought time. Another
amount      of  Rs.15,000/-,  without  prejudice  to  the   rights  and
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                       Page 6 of 11

contentions of the judgment debtor, was again offered which was
declined by the decree holder.
12.    Mr.Sukumar Pattjoshi, Advocate, again appeared on 30th
November, 2007 who had been a counsel in the suit and in the
execution petition and even before the Division Bench in the appeal
and who was not discharged in the execution petition and he sought
time on 30th November, 2007 on the ground that the decree holder is
not well and the matter was adjourned to 7th December, 2007. On 7th
December, 2007, another counsel, Mr.Rakesh Kumar Singh, appeared
on behalf of decree holder and sought time as the counsel,
Mr.Sukumar Pattajoshi, was stated to be busy in another court and,
therefore, the decree holder was directed to be present in person on
14th December, 2007 and the matter was adjourned for that date.
13.    Today an adjournment is again sought by the counsel for the
decree holder which is declined. The presence of decree holder was
directed to ascertain whether he is inclined to accept an additional
amount offered by the judgment debtor or not. The learned counsel
for decree holder states that he has no instructions about the
acceptance of the additional amount offered by the judgment debtor.
14.    Regarding the application of the judgment debtor to record
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                      Page 7 of 11

satisfaction of the decree as the amount had been tendered and
received by the decree holder prior of 30th July, 2007, it is contended
by the learned counsel for the decree holder that the amount was not
received by the decree holder.
15.    The decree holder has not filed any reply to the application
being E.A 341 of 2007 seeking recording of satisfaction of the decree.
In reply to E.A 531/2007 it is stated that the pay order has not been
received by the decree holder. Except the bald statement made in the
reply that the pay order was not received no such facts have been
disclosed which will rebut the presumption of receipt of registered
article as will arise under section 27 of General Clauses Act in the
present facts and circumstances.
16.    The letter dated 26th June, 2007 was addressed to “Mr.G.L.
Didwania, 173, Western Avenue, Sainik Farms, Khanpur, N. Delhi-
110062” which is the address of the decree holder. The learned
counsel for the decree holder is unable to point out any such facts
from the reply which will rebut the presumption of service of the
registered article at the address of the decree holder. In the reply to
application the fact that before sending the balance decreetal amount
the judgment debtor had tried to contact decree holder and a common
friend has not been specifically denied. The judgment debtor had
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                       Page 8 of 11

deposited the entire balance amount with the bank and had obtained
a pay order for the said amount. There was no reason for the
judgment debtor not to send the pay order as otherwise he would
have become liable to pay the entire decreetal amount. The decree
holder though has denied that he received the registered article but
the postal certificate produced by the judgment debtor show that the
registered article was delivered at the address it was sent which was
of the decree holder. The decree holder has been unable to rebut the
presumption of service which arises in the facts and circumstances.
The Apex Court in Harcharan Singh v. Shivrani, (1981) 2 SCC 535 ,
had held at page 542 :
              7. Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 deals with the
              topic— “Meaning of service by post” and says that where any
              Central Act or Regulation authorises or requires any document
              to be served by post, then unless a different intention appears,
              the service shall be deemed to be effected by properly address-
              ing, prepaying and posting it by registered post, a letter con-
              taining the document, and unless the contrary is proved, to
              have been effected at the time at which the letter would be de-
              livered in the ordinary course of post. The section thus raises a
              presumption of due service or proper service if the document
              sought to be served is sent by properly addressing, prepaying
              and posting by registered post to the addressee and such pre-
              sumption is raised irrespective of whether any acknowledg-
              ment due is received from the addressee or not. It is obvious
              that when the section raises the presumption that the service
              shall be deemed to have been effected it means the addressee
              to whom the communication is sent must be taken to have
              known the contents of the document sought to be served upon
              him without anything more. Similar presumption is raised un-
              der illustration ( f ) to Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act
              whereunder it is stated that the court may presume that the
              common course of business has been followed in a particular
              case, that is to say, when a letter is sent by post by prepaying
              and properly addressing it the same has been received by the
              addressee. Undoubtedly, the presumptions both under Section
              27 of the General Clauses Act as well as under Section 114 of
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                              Page 9 of 11

              the Evidence Act are rebuttable but in the absence of proof to
              the contrary the presumption of proper service or effective ser-
              vice on the addressee would arise.
17.    The judgment debtor with the permission of this court obtained
another pay order and stopped the payment of earlier pay order which
was sent to the decree holder and subsequent pay order was received
by the decree holder without prejudice to his rights and contentions.
The point for determination in the facts and circumstances is whether
the decree holder received the pay order or not in compliance with the
order of Division Bench prior to 30th July, 2007. Considering the
various facts and the bald denial of the decree holder that he did not
receive the pay order, it is apparent that the pay order which was sent
as registered article with an accompanying letter was received by him
in the facts and circumstances.         Since the judgment debtor had
already paid the amount to the concerned bank to obtain the pay
order, there was no reason for him not to send the pay order and to
risk paying the entire decreetal       amount. The presumption which
arises under clause 27 of General clauses act that the registered
article was delivered at the address it was sent, has not been rebutted
by the decree holder successfully. In the circumstances the inevitable
inferences is that the judgment debtor had paid the balance decreetal
amount by pay order to the decree holder and consequently the
decree stood satisfied.
Ex.P. No.73/2005                                           Page 10 of 11

18.    Consequently it is held that the decree has been satisfied as the
judgment debtor has paid the amount in compliance with order dated
29th May, 2007 modifying the decree dated 11th October, 2004.
Therefore, the applications being E.A 431 of 2007 and E.A 531 of
2007 seeking recording satisfaction of the decree passed against the
judgment debtor are allowed and Execution petition of decree holder
is disposed of as satisfied. All other pending applications are also
disposed of. The judgment debtor is also discharged of his statement
dated 15th September, 2006.
