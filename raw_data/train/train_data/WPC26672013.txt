2)      Pursuant to the Managing Committee’s resolution dated 19.02.1993 of
Baidyagarh Girls High School, Tarani, Rangia, during its venture stage, by order
dated 20.2.1993 the petitioner, namely, Sri Nripendra Seal, Graduate in Science
with Mathematics and Zoology was appointed as an Assistant Teacher in the said
Girls High School and the petitioner accordingly, joined the said school, in the said
capacity on 22.02.1993. Later, while the said school was still in venture stage, its
Managing Committee by a resolution dated 20.08.1994 resolved to appoint the
respondent No. 6, another Graduate in Science with Chemistry and Zoology as an
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                   Page 3 of 11

Assistant Teacher of said school, who joined his said service on 15.09.1994. Such
appointment of the petitioner as well as the respondent No. 6 as Assistant
Teacher (Science) along with two other Assistant Teachers with B.Sc. of the
school were approved by the then Inspector of Schools, Kamrup District Circle,
Guwahati on 04.11.1994.
3)      When the services of the teaching and non-teaching staffs of said
Baidyagarh Girls High School, Tarani, Rangia was taken up for consideration for
provincialisation of services under the provisions of “the Assam Venture
Educational Institutions (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011” amended in 2012
and the Directorate of Secondary Education, Assam uploaded the names of the
employees of said 2 (two) classes High School found eligible for provincialisation
under Section 4(1) of said 2011 Act, as amended, the petitioner not finding his
name as an Assistant Teacher of Science, who joined the said school on
22.2.1993 and finding the name of the respondent No. 6 who joined the said
school much later than him, i.e. on 15.09.1994 along with another Assistant
Teacher of Science who joined the school on 02.05.1988 in the website of the
said Directorate, being aggrieved, he filed necessary application in Format ‘B’
before the Director of Secondary Education, Assam, respondent No. 2 by paying
necessary Treasury Challan of Rs.25/- in his favour, through the Inspector of
Schools, Kamrup District Circle, Amingaon, Guwahati for re-examination and
review of his case. As nothing was forthcoming from the side of the Education
Department, the petitioner preferred W.P.(C) No. 2667/2013 praying for
necessary     direction  to  the   respondents    to   quash   and   set   aside   the
provincialisation of service of the respondent No.6 as an Assistant Teacher
(Science) of said Baidyagarh Girls High School and to provincialise his service
under the said 2011 Act as amended and in the interim, prayed for necessary
order restraining the authorities from provincialising the service of the respondent
No.6 in said Girls High School.
4)      This Court in WP(C) 2667/2013 on 20.05.2013, while issuing notice to the
respondents, in the interim passed an order not to provincialise the service of
respondent No. 6 as Assistant Teacher (Science) in said school disregarding the
seniority of the petitioner.
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                     Page 4 of 11

5)      Though notice was duly served on all the respondents, excepting the
respondent No. 6, the other respondents did not file any affidavit in the matter.
The respondent No. 6 in his affidavit contended that the petitioner though joined
the said school as an Assistant Teacher (Science) on 22.02.1993 but he did not
have the norms i.e. Chemistry in his degree course. It is submitted by him that
the Board of Secondary Education Assam (SEBA) on 18.05.1991, informed the
authority of said Baidyagarh Girls High School that on scrutiny of records of said
school it was found that two B.Sc. Teachers, namely, Sri Bhupen Chandra
Thakuria with Botany, Physics and Mathematics and Smti Kanaklata Devi with
Botany, Zoology and Geography, though appointed as science teachers in the
school, but none of them had chemistry in their Degree course and that the
norms of the said Board for B.Sc. teacher in High School had not been fulfilled
and as such, advised the authority of said school to appoint a B.Sc. teacher with
Chemistry in his/her degree course by adjusting the teaching staffs within a
month from the date of issue of the said letter. According to the respondent No.
6, the Managing Committee of said School on 16.12.1992 issued an advertisement
for the post of Science Graduate Teacher with Chemistry and Mathematics in
degree course giving preference to lady candidate and another Science Graduate
Teacher with Biology and Mathematics in their degree course. The respondent No.
6 also stated that the Managing Committee of said Baidyagarh Girls High School
on 20.03.1994 resolved to re-advertise the post of Assistant Teacher in Science
with Chemistry and as per the resolution of the Managing Committee of said
school dated 20.08.1994, he was appointed as an Assistant Teacher in said School
pursuant to which he joined his service on 15.09.1994.
6)      In the said affidavit, the respondent No. 6 also submitted that the
Managing Committee of said school by its resolution dated 25.11.1997 resolved
and modified its resolution No. 2 dated 19.02.1993 with regard to the
appointment of the petitioner as an Assistant Teacher and decided to portray him
as an Assistant Teacher against Class VIII of said school and directed the
Headmaster of said school to take appropriate steps in that regard and that by
resolution No. 2, the Managing Committee of said school on 26.09.2012 resolved
to convert the post of the petitioner as Assistant Teacher (Science) to the vacant
post of Craft Teacher.
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                  Page 5 of 11

7)      On coming to know of those two resolutions of the Managing Committee
of said Baidyagarh Girls High School from the affidavit of the respondent No. 6;
the petitioner Nripendra Seal preferred the second writ petition being WP(C) No.
3348/2015 challenging the said resolution No. 2 dated 26.09.2012 of the
Managing Committee of said school as noted above, stating that the petitioner
was never informed regarding conversion of him from the post of Assistant
Teacher (Science) to the post of Craft Teacher in said school and further stated
that before taking such decision, the Managing Committee of said school neither
gave him any opportunity of hearing nor the said resolution dated 26.09.2012 was
communicated to him. It is further submitted by the petitioner that such
resolution, if at all was adopted by the Managing Committee of said school,
amounts to depriving him from the benefit of provincialisation of his service as
Science Teacher of said school by giving undue advantage to the respondent No.
4 in WP(C) 3348/2015 (respondent No. 6 in WP(C) No. 2667/ 2013). In this
regard, neither the Managing Committee of said school nor its Headmaster
submitted any reply and preferred to remain silent in both the writ petitions.
8)      The provisions of Section 4(2) and Section 10(4) of “the Assam Venture
Educational Institutions (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011” amended in 2012
provided that a Two Classes High School up to its four sections can have the
maximum number of two Assistant Teachers in Science and as per the 1st proviso
to Sub-Section 2 of Section 4 of said 2011 Act where the number of such
employees serving in such venture educational institution exceeds the number as
specified in the schedule of the said act, the provincialisation of the services of the
employees shall be on the basis of seniority in respective category in the
concerned educational institution. Further Sub-Section 3 of Section 4 of said 2011
Act provided that services of a teaching or non-teaching employee in Venture
Educational Institution up to Higher Secondary level was to be considered for
provincialisation, only if, they have the requisite academic and professional
qualifications prescribed by the relevant Rules at the time of their initial
appointment.
9)      In WP(C) No. 3348/2014, the petitioner has challenged the resolution No.
2 of the Managing Committee of Baidyagarh Girls High School dated 26.09.2012
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                      Page 6 of 11

by which the petitioner’s service was converted from the post of Assistant Teacher
(Science Graduate) to the vacant post of Craft Teacher in said school, which the
petitioner could come to know only from the affidavit filed by the respondent
No.6, Dwijen Rajbongshi in WP(C) No. 2667/2013, which was passed behind him
in violation of the principles of natural justice and he prayed for setting aside and
quash the said resolution.
10)     As both the writ petitions relate to the dispute of provincialisation of
services of the petitioner and the respondent No.6/4, Dwijen Rajbongshi and as
agreed to by the parties, both the writ petitions are taken up for consideration
together.
11)     It is seen that the petitioner was appointed as an Assistant Teacher
(Science) by resolution of the School Managing Committee on 19.02.1993 and as
per the amended 1992 Rules of the Assam Secondary Education Provincialisation
Service Rules, 1982 that came into force with effect from February, 1992, for the
post of Assistant Teacher in graduate scale (arts/science/commerce) the
candidate was required to be only graduate in his/her respective stream and the
petitioner being a second class graduate in science fulfilled the criteria laid down
for the post of Assistant Teacher (Science) as on 19.2.1993 as per the amended
1992 Rules that was in force at the relevant point of time.
12)     However, during the pendency of these cases, in WP(C) No. 3190/2012
(Chandan Kr. Neog and others -Vs- State of Assam and others) and other
connected cases, disposed of on 23.9.2016, this Court held that “the Assam
Venture Educational Institutions (Provincialisation of Services) Act, 2011”,
amended in 2012 as unconstitutional and accordingly, set aside and quashed the
said 2011 Act. Subsequent to that the State Government in the Education
Department enacted the Assam Education (Provincialisation of Services of
Teachers and Re-organization of Educational Institutions) Act, 2017 which came
into force w.e.f. 11.4.2017, the date on which the said Act was published in the
Assam Gazette Extra Ordinary. It is worth mentioning that during the pendency of
these two petitions, the school in question namely Baidyagarh Girls High School
was provincialised under the said 2011 Act excepting one post of Assistant
Teacher (Science), because of the interim order passed earlier by this Court on
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                     Page 7 of 11

respondent No. 6/respondent No. 3 were not provincialisation under the said 2011
Act.

includes all serving teachers and tutors as the case may be, of a Venture
Educational Institutions who have been appointed and joined in the concerned
Venture Educational Institution before the 1st day of January, 2011 and whose
services are being or would be provincialised under the said Act.
14)     As per Section 2 (p) of the said 2017 Act “provincialisation” means taking
over the liabilities for payment of salaries including dearness allowance, medical
allowances and such other allowances to the teachers and/or tutors, as admissible
to the Government servant of similar category and gratuity, pension, leave
encashment etc. as admissible, under the existing rules to the Government
servants serving under the Government of Assam.
15)     Section 2(q) of the said 2017 Act describes “Provincialised School” and it
means an existing provincialised school or college or a Venture Educational
Institution wherein the services of teachers and tutors are provincialised under
the said Act.

framed thereunder and any other Act as the case may be, as applicable on the
day of provincialisation and whose services are provincialised under this Act in the
post of teacher or in any other post in the teaching faculty but, not as tutor under

WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                    Page 8 of 11

17)     Section 2 (u) defines “tutor” which means and includes Teachers, Assistant
Teachers, Classical Teachers and also includes Lecturers, Assistant Professors,
Associate    Professors,    Professors,    Principal,  Vice-Principal,  Demonstrator,
Headmaster, Assistant Headmaster, Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent in a

the post of Teacher under this Act due to lack of his/her educational and
professional qualifications required as per the Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Act, 2009, National Council for Teachers Education Act,
1993, University Grants Commission Act, 1956 and the relevant rules and

and 12 of said Section 13, there shall be one State Level Scrutiny Committee
(SLSC) at State level for verification of recommendation received from the District
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                      Page 9 of 11

Scrutiny Committee (DSC) that includes the Director of the concerned Education
Department as its Chairman, Joint Director/Deputy Director of the concerned
Directorate as its Member Secretary and one representative nominated by the
concerned Administrative Department as its Member and the SLSC shall have to
cause physical verification of all institutions and will also inspect all documents
and records and produce before it and call for such other record and documents
as may be required for the purpose of causing verification and when there arises
difference in between the recommendation of the DSC and the physical
verification report caused by the SLSC the matter shall be placed before the SLSC
and the decision of the SLSC shall be final.
23)      Moreover, Section 14 of said 2017 Act relates to Appellate Authority which
provides that SLSC shall be the appellate authority against any recommendation
of the DSC and the State Government in the concerned administrative department
shall be the Appellate Authority against any recommendation of the SLSC.
24)      In the present case, name of the petitioner was not uploaded for
provincialisation as Assistant Teacher in Science in said Baidyagarh Girls High
School as per provision of said 2011 Act and the names of other teaching and
non-teaching staffs of said school were already recommended by the then DSC,
Kamrup district under the provisions of the said 2011 Act and the petitioner’s
application in the format ‘B’ with requisite treasury challan of Rs.25/- was pending
before the Director of Secondary Education, Assam for re-examination and review
of his case under the said 2011 Act, which is no longer in force.
25)      Considering the entire aspect of the matter, the petitioner herein is
directed to submit a fresh representation before the respondent No. 2, the
Director of Secondary Education, Assam within 30 (thirty) days from this order
stating his all grievances regarding provincialisation of his service under the 2017
Act. In the event of filing such representation by the petitioner along with the
certified copy of this order and the necessary documents, after giving an
opportunity of hearing to both the petitioner as well as the respondent No.6 in
WP(C) No. 2667 of 2013/respondent No. 4 in WP(C) 3348 of 2014 as well as the
Managing Committee of said school, on verification of the records of said school
including the original proceeding with regard to appointment of the petitioner,
WP(C) Nos. 2667/2013 and 3348/2014                                     Page 10 of 11

said respondent No. 6/4 as the case may be and also the attendance registrar of
