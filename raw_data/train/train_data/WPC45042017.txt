                                           (ORAL)
        Heard Mr. B. J. Ghosh, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner. Also heard
Mr. T. C. Chutia, learned State counsel, appearing for the respondents.
2.      Having regard to the subject-matter in dispute, this writ petition is disposed of at the
motion stage itself without issuing any formal notice.
3.      Paspot Mahato, father of the petitioner, died in harness on 23.04.2012 while working
as a Chowkidar in the office of the Divisional Forest Officer, Dhubri. Praying for an
appointment on compassionate ground, the petitioner submitted an application on
28.06.2012 to the Divisional Forest Officer, Dhubri. The application submitted by the
W P(C) 4504/ 2017

                                                                                             2
petitioner for compassionate appointment was finally considered by the District Level
Committee (DLC) on 26.05.2016. The DLC opined that the case of the petitioner could not
be recommended as two years’ validity period had already been over. The petitioner had put
to challenge the aforesaid decision of the DLC by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India, which was registered as WP(C) 7255/2016. On 02.12.2016, the
writ said writ petition was disposed of by this Court by the following order:
                “Heard Mr. BJ Ghosh, learned counsel for the petitioner, who submits that
        the petitioner's father died in harness on 23.04.2012, while working as a Chowkidar
        in the office of the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Dhubri. The petitioner submitted
        an application dated 28.06.2012 for compassionate appointment. The DFO, Dhubri
        forwarded the petitioner's application to the Conservator of Forest on 04.07.2012,
        who in turn sent the same to the office of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest
        on 14.08.2012. Subsequently, the petitioner's application was sent by the office of
        the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest to the DFO, Dhubri on 02.04.2016. At long
        last, the DLC considered the petitioner's application on 26.05.2016, wherein the
        petitioner's application was rejected on the ground that the validity period of the
        petitioner's application had crossed the 2 years period.
                Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the reason for the delay in
        the DLC considering the petitioner's application is due to the fault of the Forest
        Department as can be seen from the dates quoted above. He also submits that
        question of the petitioner's application having spent its force does not arise while
        considering the same in line with the guidelines laid down by this Court.
                Mr. G Pegu, learned counsel for the respondent No. 4 submits that there is
        no infirmity with the decision of the DLC.
                On hearing the learned counsels for the parties, I find that the late
        consideration of the petitioner's application for compassionate appointment has been
        due to the delay caused by the Forest Department in placing the petitioner's
        application for compassionate appointment before the DLC concerned. The rejection
        of the petitioner's application for compassionate appointment on the ground that the
        petitioner's application was beyond the 2 years validity period cannot be accepted
        as the same is a wrong interpretation of the guidelines laid down by this Court in
        Achyut Ranjan Das & Ors. Vrs. State of Assam, reported in 2006 (4) GLT 674 and in
        the case of Sri Ajit Pator & Ors. Vrs. State of Assam & Ors., reported in 2009 (3) GLT
        306.
                A reading of the guidelines goes to show that the question of an application
        having spent its force would be applicable only when there were no vacancies
W P(C) 4504/ 2017

                                                                                              3
        available during the period the application for compassionate appointment was valid.
        An application for compassionate appointment has to be deemed to be valid for 2
        years from the date of its submission provided that the said application is submitted
        within the time limit prescribed. In the present case, the petitioner has submitted his
        application for compassionate appointment within the time limit prescribed.
                Accordingly, the DLC would have to consider the petitioner's application with
        respect to the vacancies that arose during the validity period of the application. A
        perusal of DLC meeting minutes dated 26.05.2016 and the letter dated 27.05.2016
        issued by the DFO, Dhubri goes to show that there were vacancies available in the
        year 2012, 2013 and 2014. Accordingly, the DLC would have to consider the
        petitioner's application for the vacancies that occurred during the validity of the
        petitioner's application.
                In that view of the matter, the DLC meeting minutes dated 26.05.2016 is
        hereby set aside to the extent that it relates to the petitioner's application for
        compassionate appointment, wherein the DLC has rejected the petitioner's
        application. Accordingly, the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 shall place the petitioner's
        application for compassionate appointment before the DLC for re-consideration in its
        next meeting. The DLC shall thereafter consider the petitioner's application for
        compassionate appointment with respect to the vacancies that occurred during the
        period of validity of the petitioner's application.
                The DLC shall consider the petitioner's application not later than 3 (three)
        months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
                Writ petition stands disposed off accordingly.”
4.      A perusal of the aforesaid order goes to show that the rejection of the petitioner’s
application for compassionate appointment on the ground that the petitioner’s application
was beyond the two years’ validity period was not accepted by the Court and it was held
that an application for compassionate appointment has to be deemed to be valid for two
years from the date of its submission to the DLC provided that the said application was
submitted by the applicant within the time limit prescribed. In the aforesaid order dated
02.12.2016, this Court recorded that the application filed by the petitioner for
compassionate appointment was within the time limit and, accordingly, a direction was
issued to the DLC to consider the petitioner’s application with respect to the vacancies that
had arisen during the validity period of the application. A finding was also recorded by the
Court that it was seen from the minutes of the DLC meeting held on 26.05.2016 and the
letter dated 27.05.2016, issued by the Divisional Forest Officer, Dhubri, that there were
vacancies available during the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.
W P(C) 4504/ 2017

                                                                                                4
5.      Pursuant to the direction of the Court issued in the aforesaid order dated
02.12.2016, case of the petitioner for compassionate appointment was considered and
rejected by the DLC in its meeting held on 10.04.2017 with the following observations:
                 “In case of Sl. No. 1, namely, Shri Pankaj Kr. Mahato, S/o Late Paspat
        Mahato, it appears that the applicant has submitted the application on
        compassionate ground in the Office of the Divisional Forest Officer, Dhubri on
        28.06.2016 and, accordingly, the same was sent to the PCCF & HOFF, Assam,
        directly by the said Office but it has been returned by the SLC seeking that the
        application should be placed formally in the DLC. The DLC examined the proposal
        and found that the proposal does not fulfill the two important criteria, namely, (a)
        the deceased Govt. Servant does not have a balance of 3 years of service and (b)
        the application validity period of 2 years already over as per latest Govt. O.M. Since a
        fresh O.M. has been issued vide No. ABP.50/2005/ Pt/182 dated 01.06.2015 by the
        Personnel Deptt., by superseding the all earlier O.M. therefore, the proposal of Sri
        Pankaj Kr. Mahato may not be recommended.
                   Name                      Date of           Date of                  Date of
                                             Death             Application      Superannuation
        Sl.No.1. Shri Pankaj Kr. Mahato    23.04.2012          28.06.2012             31.10.2013
                 (S/o Lt. Paspat Mahato)                                      (1 yr. 6 M 8 Days)”
6.      From the above, it is seen that the case of the petitioner was rejected by the DLC in
view of the Government Office Memorandum dated 01.06.2015 on the ground that the case
of the petitioner does not fulfill two conditions incorporated in the Office Memorandum
dated 01.06.2015, which are: (a) the deceased Government servant did not have balance of
three years of service and (b) the application validity period of two years had already
elapsed.
7.      It is already noticed that this Court, in its order dated 02.12.2016, had held that the
petitioner had submitted his application for compassionate appointment within the time limit
prescribed and, accordingly, the Court had set aside the minutes of the meeting of the DLC
held on 26.05.2016 by holding that the rejection of the case of the petitioner by the DLC on
the ground that two years validity period had expired was on account of wrong
interpretation of the guidelines laid down by this Court in Achyut Ranjan Das & Ors. Vrs.
State of Assam, reported in 2006 (4) GLT 674 and in the case of Sri Ajit Pator & Ors. Vrs.
State of Assam & Ors., reported in 2009 (3) GLT 306.
8.      That apart, the case of the petitioner for compassionate appointment having arisen
prior to the issuance of the Office Memorandum dated 01.06.2015, the said Office
W P(C) 4504/ 2017

                                                                                             5
Memorandum cannot be made applicable while considering the case of the petitioner for
appointment on compassionate ground.
9.      The Supreme Court, in the cases of State Bank of India and others Vs. Jaspal Kaur,
reported in (2007) 9 SCC 571, and Canara Bank and Another vs. M. Mahesh Kumar,
reported in (2015) 7 SCC 412, had laid down that the scheme governing compassionate
appointment at the time of making application for compassionate appointment would govern
the claim for compassionate appointment.
10.     Admittedly, when the petitioner had submitted his application for compassionate
appointment on 28.06.2012, the Office Memorandum dated 01.06.2015 had not seen the
light of the day. In that view of the matter, the decision-making process of the DLC, while
considering the case of the petitioner for compassionate appointment, is vitiated on account
of misplaced application of the Office Memorandum dated 01.06.2015.
11.     Having regard to the above, the decision taken by DLC in its meeting held on
26.05.2016, rejecting the case of the petitioner for compassionate appointment is set aside
with a direction to the DLC to re-consider the case of the petitioner, in accordance with law,
within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
12.     Writ petition stands allowed and disposed of in terms of the above.
                                                                            JUDGE
