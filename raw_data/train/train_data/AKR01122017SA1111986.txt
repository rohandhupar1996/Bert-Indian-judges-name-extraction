       PRESENT:
                    THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE A.K.RATH
                          Date of hearing and judgment: 01.12.2017
Dr. A.K.Rath, J    Plaintiff is the appellant against an affirming judgment.
       The suit was for declaration that the order dated 26.12.1983 passed by
       the Secretary, Nandini Debi High School at Kanapur in the district of
       Keonjhar directing the plaintiff to hand over the charge is illegal.
       02.         The case of the plaintiff was that Nandini Debi High School
       was established in the year 1973. He was appointed as teacher of the
       School on 01.10.1974. Subsequently, he was appointed as Headmaster
       of the School as per resolution by the Managing Committee dated
       31.07.1982. In the year 1982, the School received Rs.44,441/- as

                                      2
grant-in-aid in two instalments. It was further pleaded that one Prafulla
Kumar Jena was appointed as Headmaster of the School illegally.
Defendant no.1, Secretary of the School, sent a notice on 26.12.1983
directing the plaintiff to hand over charge of the Office of the
Headmaster to Prafulla Kumar Jena.          With this factual scenario, he
instituted the suit seeking the relief mentioned supra.
03.           Defendant nos.1, 2, 4 to 8 filed their written statement
denying the assertions made in the plaint. The specific case of the
defendants was that the plaintiff was appointed as Hindi Teacher and
functioning as such till 31.07.1982. In the absence of the Headmaster,
he was in charge of the Headmaster temporarily from 31.07.1982 and
functioning as such till a qualified Headmaster was available. Under the
Education Code, the Headmaster must be a trained graduate.              Since
the plaintiff was not a trained graduate, he could not be appointed as
Headmaster of the School. Thus the letter issued by the Secretary
dated 26.12.1983 was valid.
04.           The defendant no.3 filed a written statement supporting
the case of the plaintiff. According to him, the plaintiff was in charge
of the Headmaster till a permanent Headmaster was appointed.
05.           On the, inter se, pleadings of the parties, the learned trial
court    struck  five  issues.  Both    parties  led   evidence,   oral   and
documentary, to substantiate their cases. The learned trial court came
to hold that the plaintiff lacks requisite qualification to hold the post of
Headmaster. He was an untrained teacher.           The letter issued by the
Secretary was legal. Held so, it dismissed the suit. The unsuccessful
plaintiff challenged the judgment and decree of the learned trial court
before the learned Sub-ordinate Judge, Anandapur in T.A. No. 06 of
1984, which was eventually dismissed.

                                            3
06.              The      Second   Appeal    was  admitted  on  the  following
substantial question of law:-
              “Have the courts below committed any error of law in
              upholding the relief of the appellant on 26.12.1983 by
              the Secretary of the disputed Managing Committee ?”
07.              Heard Mr. B.K. Pattnaik, learned counsel for the appellant.
None appears for the respondents.
08.              The suit was filed in the year 1984. At the time of the filing
of the suit, the plaintiff was 47 years old.          In the meantime, thirty
three years have elapsed. The plaintiff is eighty years old by now. He
has retired from service two decades back on attaining the age of
superannuation.            Thus no effective decree can be passed. In view of
the same, the substantial question of law framed by this Court does
not require any adjudication.
09.              Resultantly, the appeal fails and is dismissed. No costs.
                                                       …………………....……..
                                                        DR. A.K.RATH, J.
