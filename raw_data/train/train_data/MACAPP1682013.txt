                               JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
                  The MAC App No.168/2013 and MAC App No.169/2013 have been filed
       by the United India Insurance Co. Ltd against the common judgment and award
       passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Goalpara in MAC Case No.94/2006
       and 95/2006.      In both the appeals, the appellant, as well as, the ground of
       challenge are common and therefore, both the appeals are taken to be decided
       by this common judgment.
       [2]        Brief facts necessary for disposal of these appeals are that on 28-09-
       1998 late Uddhab Ch. Das aged about 40 years and late Amal Ch. Das aged
       about 25 years were travelling in a car bearing registration No.AS-01/9219 along
       with other co-passengers from Dhupdhara to Goalpara. On the way, at a place
       called Tiplai Tiniali the extremists ambushed the vehicle killing the passengers of
       the car including the victims, Uddhab Ch. Das and Amal Ch. Das. The legal heirs
       of both the victims have filed the claim petition before the MACT Goalpara and
       the Tribunal on appreciation of evidence passed the impugned award in favour of
       the claimants in both the cases, which are under challenge in these appeals.
       [3]        I have heard Mr. S Dutta, learned senior counsel for the appellant and
       Mr. H Das, learned counsel for the respondent.
       [4]        By placing reliance on the decisions on Rita Devi and Ors vs. N ew
       I ndia Assurance Co. Ltd and Anr reported in 2000 (5) SCC 113 and Biplab Basi
       Vs. Oriental I nsurance Co. Ltd and Anr reported in 2005(3) GLT 407 , Mr. Dutta
       submits that the death of the victim in both the cases were pure and simple
       homicidal death and cannot be considered as accidental death as a result of use
       of motor vehicle and therefore, the award passed by the learned Tribunal are
       required to be set-aside.
       [5]         The learned counsel for the respondent also placing reliance on the
       same decisions as well as the decision of this High Court in Rita Das and Ors Vs.
       Oriental I nsurance Com pany Ltd and Ors reported in 2013 (1) GLT 346
MAC App No.168/2013
MAC App No.169/2013

                                                                                                  4
       submits, that it was a case of accidental death for negligence on the part of the
       driver and therefore, learned Tribunal has rightly passed the award.
       [6]        From the rival submission of both the sides, the point for consideration
       is whether the death of the victims, in both the cases, were accidental death
       arising out of use of motor vehicle as a result of rash and negligence of the
       driver of the vehicle.
       [7]        The facts in Rita Devi (supra) were that a vehicle, which was a public
       carrier, was hired by some unknown person, who had killed the driver and stolen
       away the vehicle. The issue before the Apex Court was whether the death of the
       driver of the vehicle, who was killed by the miscreants, and the vehicle was
       stolen, would be an accident for the purpose of Motor Vehicle Act. On the above
       facts, the Apex Court answering the questions, whether a murder can be an
       accident in any given case, held in para 10 as under:
                                “10. The question, therefore is, can a murder be an accident in
                       any given case? There is no doubt that ‘murder’, as it is understood, in
                       the common parlance is a felonious act where death is caused with
                       intent and the perpetrators of that act normally have a motive against
                       the victim for such killing. But there are also instances where murder
                       can be by accidenton a given set of facts. The difference between a
                       “murder” which is not an accident and a “murder” which is an accident,
                       depends on the proximity of the cause of such murder. In our opinion, if
                       the dominant intention of the Act of felony is to kill any particular person
                       then such killing is not an accidental murder but is murder simpliciter,
                       while if the cause of murder or act of murder was originally not intended
                       and the same was caused in furtherance of any other felonious act then
                       such murder is an accidental murder.”
       [8]        A Division Bench of this Court in B iplab Basi Das Vs. Oriental
       I nsurance Co. Ltd and Anr reported in 2005 (3) GLT 407 relying on Rita Devi’s
       case observed that when the dominant intention was not to cause death of any
       particular individual, but an attack on the use of vehicle, the death arising out of
       such occurrence, would be treated as an accidental death. The Tribunal may in
       any appropriate case, be required to determine as to what was the dominant
       intention for causing injury to or death of a passenger in a vehicle.                 If the
       dominant intention was to cause death of a particular individual, then it will

MAC App No.169/2013

                                                                                        5
       amount to murder, but if the dominant object was connected with the use of the
       vehicle at a public place, then death would be described to have been caused as
       a result of accident.
        [9]        In Oriental I nsurance Co. Ltd Vs. Dongk holam and Ors reported in
       2006 (2) GLT 1 , the death was caused to the passengers travelling in the vehicle
       due to indiscriminate firing by the extremist and this Court held on the facts of
       the case, that death of the victims was not murder, rather because of the fault of
       the driver, in not having taken care of the life and safety of the passengers.
       [10]        Facts of the present case are similar to that of Dong Kholam and Ors
       (supra). Here also death of the victims was caused due to extremist firing, while
       they were travelling in a motor vehicle. Whether the death of the victims was
       murder or accidental death, would obviously depend on the facts and
       circumstances of the case. On appreciation of evidence, learned Tribunal came
       to the conclusion that death of the victims was accidental and awarded
       compensation accordingly.
       [11]        I have gone through the evidence brought on record. Pw-2 Sri Hitesh
       Rai (in both the cases), who was a passenger in the same vehicle and an eye
       witness of the occurrence, categorically stated, that he was travelling in the
       same vehicle with the victims and on their way to Goalpara, they heard a big
       sound of firing and as soon as they reached Rongjuli reserved forest area, they
       have noticed from a long distance that an army truck was stranded at the place
       of occurrence.     Seeing the army truck and hearing the sound of firing, they
       asked the driver to stop the vehicle, but the driver did not stop the vehicle and
       moved forward.       While the vehicle was crossing Tiplai Tiniali, the extremist
       started firing on the CRPF truck and also on the vehicle in which the deceased
       were travelling, and as a result of which, Amal Ch. Das and Uddhab Ch. Das died
       on the spot. Pw-2 also received bullet injuries. This part of evidence of Pw-2,
       who was an eye witness of the occurrence, remained uncontroverted. Pw-3 has
       deposed in his evidence that five CRPF personnel were also killed in the said
       indiscriminate firing by the extremist and therefore, it is evident from the oral
MAC App No.168/2013
MAC App No.169/2013

                                                                                         6
       testimony of Pw-2 and Pw-3, that the extremist indiscriminately fired on the
       vehicle carrying security persons and also on the vehicle wherein the victims
       were travelling at the same place, leading to death of several persons including
       the security personnel.         The above conduct of the extremist, firing
       indiscriminately on the vehicles at a public place leading to death of various
       persons, speaks loud and clear that the dominant intention of the extremist was
       not to kill any particular person, at best the intention of the extremist who fired
       at the vehicles indiscriminately can be attributed to creation of terror by
       attacking vehicles at public places.
       [12]       The unshaken testimony of Pw-2, who was an eye witness of the
       accident, that noticing the CRPF vehicle standing at a distance and also hearing
       the sound of firing, they asked the driver to stop and not to move forward, but
       the driver ignoring such request of the passengers moved the vehicle, as a result
       of which the passengers travelling in the vehicle became the victim of the
       extremist attack, clearly demonstrates want of proper care and caution on the
       part of the driver.
       [13]        The term negligence in its normal connotation implies absence of
       taking proper care and attention, which is expected of a prudent man in a
       particular situation. In the instant case, despite the request of the passengers
       not to move and stop the vehicle after hearing sound of firing, the driver without
       taking proper care, moved the vehicle forward, and as a result of which, the
       passengers in the vehicle became the victim of firing by the extremists.
       Therefore, the conduct of the driver in the instant case i.e. not taking proper
       care and caution, for safety of the passengers resulting in death of the
       passengers, is sufficient to attribute negligence on the part of the driver of the
       offending vehicle. When the driver was evidently at fault because of not paying
       heed to the request of the passengers and moving forward endangering the life
       of the passengers, and the dominant intention of the extremist also having not
       found to be the killing of any particular person, there cannot be any escape from
       the conclusion that death of victim, was accidental death, while they were
       travelling in the vehicle because of the fault of the driver of the vehicle. Since

       there was fault of the driver and the death was accidental and the vehicle was
       insured, the appellant Insurance Company being the insurer of the offending
       vehicle cannot avoid the liability to pay compensation.
       [14]      In view of what has been discussed herein above, the appeal is found
       to be without merit and accordingly dismissed.
