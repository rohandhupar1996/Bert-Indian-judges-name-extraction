HIMA KOHLI, J. (Oral)
1.            The present petition is filed by the petitioners under Section 482
of the Cr.PC seeking quashing of FIR No.326/2008 lodged by the respondent
No.2/company          against      the       petitioners      under         Sections
406/420/467/468/471/120B IPC, registered with Police Station: Darya Ganj,
Distt. Central Delhi.
2.            In the complaint, the respondent No.2/complainant accused
petitioner No.1 and his father, Dr.Himmat Singh Rathore of non-payment of
dues payable by various parties for taking vehicles on hire-purchase from
CRL. M.C. 1507/2010                                                    Page 1 of 3

the complainant, at the recommendation of the petitioner No.1 and his
father. It is further alleged that the petitioners had projected themselves as
financers to the hirers and received payments towards the hire installments
in the name of the complainant/company for depositing the amounts in its
account, which they failed to do. Pursuant to lodging of the aforesaid FIR,
investigation was carried out by the police authorities and thereafter, the
prosecution    filed a   charge-sheet   against   the  petitioners  before    the
Metropolitan Magistrate, Tis Hazari Courts.       In the said proceedings, the
petitioner No.1 sought regular bail, which was granted in his favour.         The
petitioner No.2 was given anticipatory bail from the High Court.
3.           Now, the parties state that during the pendency of the aforesaid
proceeding, they have settled their dispute amicably in terms of the MOU
dated 19.06.2009 (Annexure-B).       As per the settlement arrived at between
the parties, the petitioners have agreed to pay a sum of Rs.1 crore in
installments to the respondent No.2/complainant, in return of which, the
respondent No.2/complainant has agreed not to oppose the prayer made by
the petitioners for quashing of the FIR, subject matter of the present
petition.
4.           Counsels for the parties state that the entire sum of Rs.1 crore
has since been received by the respondent No.2/complainant from the
petitioners.   The petitioners are present in Court.    So is Shri Baljit Singh
Kohli, the authorized representative of the respondent No.2/company, who
hands over a copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors of the
respondent No.2/company held on 01.10.2008 authorizing him to appear on
behalf of the company, which is taken on the record.      The parties appear to
have arrived at the aforesaid settlement of their own free will and volition
CRL. M.C. 1507/2010                                                 Page 2 of 3

and without any undue coercion or influence from any quarter. Learned APP
also states that she has no objection to the aforesaid settlement being
accepted by the Court and the prayer made in the petition being allowed,
subject to the petitioners being burdened with costs.
5.           There appears no legal impediment in allowing the present
petition. However, considering the fact that on account of the petitioners,
the legal machinery of the State has been set into motion, which has
resulted in incurring of unnecessary expenditure and wastage of time, while
quashing FIR No.326/2008 registered by the respondent No.2/company
against the petitioners and allowing the present petition, it is directed that
the petitioners shall pay costs of Rs.20,000/-, out of which Rs.10,000/- shall
be deposited with the Delhi High Court Lawyersâ€™ Welfare Fund and the
remaining amount of Rs.10,000/- shall be deposited with the Delhi Police
Welfare Fund.     Needful shall be done within two weeks.      Copy of proof of
deposit of the aforesaid costs shall be furnished to the learned APP for the
State within two weeks.
6.           The petition is disposed of. File be consigned to the record room.
                                                               (HIMA KOHLI)
