         In the matter of an application under Articles 226 & 227 of the
         Constitution of India.

         Bijay Shankar Sarangi                ………     Petitioner
                                        -versus-
         Orissa State Road Transport          ………     Opp. Parties
         Corporation, represented by its
         Managing Director, Bhubaneswar,
         Dist-Khurda and others
                 For Petitioner   :   Mr. Somadarshan Mohanty
                 For Opp.Parties   :  Mr. Ashok Mohanty, Sr. Adv.
         PRESENT:
                   THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI
              Date of hearing: 23.02.2016 | Date of judgment: 03.03.2016
Dr. B.R.Sarangi, J.      The petitioner, who was working as a Driver in the
         Orissa State Road Transport Corporation (hereinafter referred to as
         “O.S.R.T.C.) has filed this application seeking to quash the order
         dated 28.6.2005 passed by the opposite party no.3-District Transport
         Manager (A), O.S.R.T.C., Sambalpur and further seeking for a
         declaration that his date of birth is 11.2.1940 and he has to retire
         from service on attaining the age of superannuation on 28.2.2000 and

                                       2
also to grant consequential benefits along with interest within a
stipulated time.
2.               The factual matrix of the case in hand is that petitioner
was appointed as a Driver in the Orissa State Road Transport
Corporation vide letter no.737 dated 30.1.1968 and joined as such on
5.2.1968. His date of birth was entered in the service book as
11.2.1940 as per the OGFR Vol-I and such entry has been done by the
then D.T.M. (Administration). The petitioner also signed the service
book as a token of his acceptance of the entries. Therefore, on
attaining the age of superannuation, the petitioner has to retire from
service on 28.2.2000 at the age of 60 years, but he has been retired
from service on 12.12.1995 without any prior notice. Treating such
premature retirement as removal from service, the petitioner has
approached this Court earlier by filing OJC No. 112 of 1995 and this
Court did not feel inclined to interfere with the same. Thereafter, the
petitioner filed Title Suit No. 35 of 1998 before the learned Civil Judge
(Jr. Division), Sambalpur seeking for a direction that his retirement on
12.12.1995 is illegal and he is entitled to continue in service till
28.2.2000 with consequential financial benefits. The learned Civil
Judge (Jr. Division), Sambalpur framed as many as seven issues and
while deciding issue nos. 5 and 7 came to a finding that the order of
retirement passed by the authority retiring the petitioner from service
on 12.12.1995 without giving opportunity of hearing is violative of

                                       3
natural justice. He directed the authority to conduct enquiry as to the
correctness of the date of birth of the petitioner by giving opportunity
of hearing to him and do the needful while considering his service
benefit as per law. In compliance to the same, the authority has
passed the order impugned in Annexure-1 holding that the date of
birth of the petitioner is 18.11.1933 and his superannuation on
attaining the age of 60 years being 30.11.1993, he has already
overstayed for the period from 30.11.1993 to 12.12.1995, which is
treated as non-qualifying service and during the aforesaid period he
will   get   salary,   after   deducting   pension    as   after  attaining
superannuation, pension will be determined and paid to him. Being
aggrieved by such order, the petitioner has approached this Court by
filing the present writ application.
3.               Mr. Somadarshan Mohanty, learned counsel for the
petitioner strenuously urged that the order passed by the opposite
party no.3 in Annexure-1 in compliance to the direction given by the
learned Civil Judge (Jr. Division), Sambalpur in Title Suit No. 35 of
1998 dated 8.3.2004 cannot sustain in the eye of law inasmuch as
when the date of birth entry made in the service book is 11.2.1940
and    that  has   been    changed   unilaterally  by   the   employer   to
18.11.1933 and the opposite party has acted upon the same, that
itself   amounts    to   violation of   natural   justice,  arbitrary   and
unreasonable exercise of power by the authority concerned. Further

                                      4
the evidence which has been relied upon while causing inquiry in
Annexure-1 has been considered and rejected by the learned Civil
Judge.   Therefore   the   same   could  not   have   been   taken into
consideration while passing the order impugned holding that the
petitioner’s date of birth is 18.11.1933 and his superannuation is
based on the basis of 30.11.1993 and he has overstayed the period
from 30.11.1993 to 12.12.1995 and the same should be treated as
non-qualifying service. It is further urged that the statement of the
brother   of  the  petitioner-D.W.2   in  the   court  below   who  has
categorically stated that the date of birth of the petitioner is
11.2.1940 has not been taken into consideration merely on the basis
that the age of the brother of the petitioner as noted in the voter list
67 years and determination has been made accordingly. Therefore,
the same cannot sustain in the eye of law. To substantiate his
contention, reliance has been placed on the judgments in State of
Bihar and another v. Radha K. Jha and others etc. etc, AIR 2002
SC 2755, V. Parukutty Mannadissiar and another v. State of
Kerala and others, AIR 1990 SC 817.
4.              Mr. Ashok Mohanty, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for
the opposite party-Corporation strenuously justified the order passed
by the opposite party no.3 in Annexure-1 and stated that the
petitioner after repeated notice has not produced any record to
substantiate his date of birth as entered in the service book. However,

                                      5
on 9.5.2005 he appeared before the opposite party no.3 and in the
meantime, opposite party no.3 ascertained that the petitioner was a
student of Cheruapada Primary School vide serial no.158 dated
16.1.1939 of the admission register of the said primary school,
wherein    his  date  of birth   was   recorded   as    18.11.1933.   The
Headmaster of Cherupada Primary School intimated the office vide
letter no.457 dated 6.12.1995 pursuant to the letter of opposite party
no.3 dated 20.11.1995 that the date of birth of the petitioner was
recorded in the school register as 18.11.1933. Accordingly, necessary
correction was made in the service book and the petitioner was
directed vide Annexure-2 dated 12.12.1995 to retire from service on
attaining the age of 60 years on 30.11.1993 but by that time he has
already overstayed the period from 30.11.1993 to 12.12.1995 and
therefore, he was made to retire from service on that date. Further
reliance has been placed on the statement made by his brother in T.S.
No. 35 of 1998 and the letter received during inquiry conducted by
opposite party no.3 from the headmaster of the school that the date
of birth of the petitioner is 18.11.1933. Therefore, no illegality and
irregularity has been committed by the authority in passing the order
impugned and accordingly he seeks for dismissal of the writ petition.
5.              On the basis of the facts pleaded, it is to be considered
whether the order passed in Annexure-1 is in due compliance to the
judgment passed in T.S. No. 35 of 1998 or not. As it appears, the

                                              6
date of birth of the petitioner entered in the service book is 11.2.1940
and the said entry has been made by opposite party no.3 and the
petitioner is only a signatory to the first page of service book stating
that the entry made is correct. But subsequently the date of birth was
found to be as 18.11.1933 according to which petitioner was to
superannuate from service on attaining the age of 60 years on
30.11.1993. But by the time the correct date of birth was ascertained,
the petitioner has already continued in service till 12.12.1995 and
therefore, the overstayed period from 30.11.1993 to 12.12.1995 was
treated to be non-qualifying service. If the learned Civil Judge (Jr.
Division), Sambalpur passed the judgment declaring the retirement of
the petitioner as illegal and violative of natural justice and directed
opposite party no.3 to conduct inquiry as to the correctness of date of
birth of the petitioner by affording opportunity of hearing, opposite
party no.3 has to look into the entry made in the service book itself.
6.               Law has been well settled by the apex Court in State
of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei and others, AIR 1967 SC
1269, wherein the apex Court held as follows:-
                    “It is true that the order is administrative in character,
             but even an administrative order which involves civil
             consequences, as already stated, must be made consistently
             with the rules of natural justice after informing the first
             respondent of the4 case of the State, the evidence in support
             thereof and after giving an opportunity to the first respondent
             of being heard and meeting or explaining the evidence. No
             such steps were admittedly taken, the High Court was, in our
             judgment, right in setting aside the order of the State.”

                                      7
7.             In view of the aforesaid provisions, if the authority
wants to change the date of birth entry made in the service book, due
opportunity has to be given to the petitioner and without giving
opportunity to the petitioner, action has been taken for retirement by
antedating his date of birth. Therefore the order so passed cannot
sustain in the eye of law. Reliance is placed on V. Parukutty
Mannadissiar and another (supra), wherein the apex Court held
that Government can not alter the decision by the administrative
order when there is specific direction of the High Court. The ratio of
the said judgment is applicable to the present context. When the
learned Civil court directed for consideration of the grievance of the
petitioner, opposite party no.3 should have considered the same in
accordance with law and passed the order inasmuch as when there is
change of date of birth recorded in the service book, the authority
should have followed the principles of natural justice before taking any
action. But here is a case where action has already been taken and
subsequently such action having been challenged, the learned Civil
Judge (Jr. Division), Sambalpur directed for compliance of natural
justice. Without doing so, the order impugned in Annexure-1 has been
passed. With regard to the reliance placed on State of Bihar and
another mentioned (supra), this Court is of the considered view that
the same is not applicable to the present context.

                                      8
8.              In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it
appears that while passing the order impugned in Annexure-1
changing the date of birth of the petitioner, there is non-compliance of
principles of natural justice. The ratio of State of Orissa v. Dr.
(Miss) Binapani Dei and others squarely applies to the present
context and in absence of adherence to the same, the order impugned
in Annexure-1 cannot sustain. In that view of the matter, the order
dated 28.6.2005 in Annexure-1 is hereby quashed and the matter is
remitted back to opposite party no.3-District Transport Manager
(Administration), Sambalpur for reconsideration of the same in
accordance with law by affording opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner within a period of three months from the date of
communication of this judgment.
9.             Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of. However,
there would be no order to costs.
                                         ………………………..
