                                 JUDGMENT

CM No.31779/ 2016(exemption)
         Allowed, subject to all just exceptions.
W.P.(C) 7703/2016 & C.M. No.31778/2016(stay)
 1.      The petitioner has filed the present petition impugning the action of
 the respondent in mandating that for all bids to be submitted, the EPF code
W.P.(C) No7703 /2016                                                          Page 1 of 2

 should be uploaded.
2.       The contention of the petitioner is that in certain organizations,
 which employ less than 20 employees, the registration with the
 Employees’ Provident Fund Authority is not mandatory and as such, the
 said organisation may not have an EPF code and mandating an
 organisation to upload an EPF code while submitting its bid would
 disqualify an otherwise eligible bidder from participating.
3.       Learned counsel for the respondent has filed a status report
 contending that by notification dated 17.10.2016, the impugned condition
 has been modified thereby requiring an organisation to submit an EPF
 code, only "if applicable".
4.       It is submitted that if an organisation does not require registration
 with the Employees'' Provident Fund authority, it would not be mandatory
 for the said organisation to upload the EPF code, however if an
 organisation requires registration then an EPF code would be required to
 be submitted prior to the release of the work order.
5.       In view of the above, no further orders are called for.
6.       The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of.
7.       Dasti under signatures of the Court Master.
