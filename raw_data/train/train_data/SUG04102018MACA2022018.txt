                        JUDGMENT
                          (ORAL)
1.    The above captioned two appeals arise out of common impugned
Award of 9th January, 2018 pertaining to an accident which occurred on
MAC.APP. 202/2018                                                   Page 1 of 5
MAC.APP. 287/2018

13th April, 2009 at about 06:00 AM in Palwal, Haryana. The accident in
question had occurred due to collusion of a car and a truck.
2.    The above captioned first appeal is preferred by IFFCO Tokio
General Insurance Company Limited, who is the Insurer of the car
(henceforth referred to as the “Insurer of the car”), whereas the second
captioned appeal is preferred by Royal Sundaram General Insurance
Company Limited, who is the Insurer of the truck (henceforth referred to
as the “Insurer of truck”) involved in the accident. Learned Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the „Tribunal‟) has
fastened the liability of 25% upon Insurer of the car and 75% upon
Insurer of the truck involved in the accident, to pay the awarded
compensation.
3.    Since these two appeals arise out of common Award of 9th January,
2018, therefore, both these appeals have been heard together and are
being decided by this common judgment. The facts as noted in opening
paragraphs of the impugned Award are as under:-
                “Facts in brief as emerged from the claim petition
        are that on April 13,2009, deceased (Gurmeet Singh) was
        going in a car bearing registration no. DL-4CAD-4959
        alongwith Deepanker Malik, Dishant and Bhuwan and
        the car was being driven by Deepanker Malik. It was
        alleged that at about 6.00 a.m when their car reached
        village Sarai, G.T.Road within the jurisdiction of PS
        Palwal, their car rammed into Truck Trolla bearing
        registration no. HR-47D-6492 as the said Trolla was
        parked in the middle of road without any signal and
        indication. It was alleged that accident had taken place
        due to composite negligence of driver of the truck trolla
MAC.APP. 202/2018                                                  Page 2 of 5
MAC.APP. 287/2018

         as he parked his Trolla in the middle of road without any
         signal or indication as well as negligence of the car
         driver as he failed to notice the said Trolla. It was
         alleged that due to collision, all occupants except
         Bhuwan sustained fatal injuries whereas Bhuwan
         sustained serious injuries. In this regard an FIR under
         Section 283/337/304-A IPC was got registered at PS
         Palwal, Faridabad, Haryana.”
4.      The Tribunal in the impugned Award proceeds on the undisputed
fact that the car in question had hit the stationary truck, which was parked
in the middle of the road near the Toll barrier, at Palwal, Haryana, at
about 06:00 AM on 13th April, 2009, without any signal or indicator. The
Tribunal has relied upon evidence of Mr. Neeraj Garg (PW-3), who was
following the car in question in his own car and while dealing with the
evidence of aforesaid witness, the Tribunal has concluded that the
liability of the Insurer of the car in question is 25% and of the Insurer of
the truck in question is 75%, to pay the awarded compensation.
5.      The challenge to the impugned Award by learned counsel for
Insurer of the car in question is on the ground that there was no
negligence on the part of the car driver and to submit so, attention of this
Court is drawn to evidence of Neeraj Garg (PW-3). It is pointed out that
Insurer of the truck in question had not led any evidence to the contrary
and so, the liability to pay the awarded compensation is of the Insurer of
the truck in question.
6.      On the contrary, the stand taken by counsel for Insurer of the truck
is that no negligence is attributable to the truck driver and in any case,
liability to pay the awarded compensation cannot be more than 50%, as
MAC.APP. 202/2018                                                    Page 3 of 5
MAC.APP. 287/2018

the car driver was required to maintain safe distance from the vehicle
ahead and so, the liability to pay the awarded compensation should be
equally apportioned between the Insurers of the car and truck in question.
7.     Upon hearing and on perusal of impugned Award and the evidence
on record, I find that Neeraj Garg (PW-3) is infact an eye witness of this
accident, as he was behind the car which colluded with the truck, which
was stationary in the middle of the road, without any signal or indicator.
Although Neeraj Garg (PW-3) in his evidence has stated that the sole
negligence was of the truck driver, but I find that due to this accident, the
car which was driven by deceased, was badly damaged. So, it cannot be
said that the negligence was solely of the truck driver. Supreme Court in
Raj Rani & Ors. Vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited & Ors. (2009)
13 SCC 654, where the truck was stationary, held that liability of the
parties to pay the awarded compensation has to be assessed in the ratio of
50:50. In light of the evidence on record, site plan of place of accident on
record, this Court finds that the Tribunal has erred in putting the liability
of paying 75% compensation on the Insurer of truck in question. In the
considered opinion of this Court, negligence of drivers of the car and
truck involved in this accident is 50:50.
8.     Consequentially, the impugned Award is modified to the extent
that liability to pay the awarded compensation shall be in the ratio of
50:50. That is to say, 50% of the awarded compensation shall be paid by
the Insurer of the car in question and remaining 50% by Insurer of the
Truck in question. IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company Limited is
directed to deposit the enhanced share of compensation with the Tribunal
MAC.APP. 202/2018                                                    Page 4 of 5
MAC.APP. 287/2018

within four weeks and thereafter, the compensation be released to the
Claimants in the ratio and manner, as indicated in the impugned Award, if
not already done.
9.     With aforesaid modification in the impugned Award, the above
captioned two appeals are disposed of.
