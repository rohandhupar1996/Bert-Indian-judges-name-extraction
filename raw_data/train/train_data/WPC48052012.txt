                                             BEFORE

                       For the petitioner:       Mr. NNB Choudhury, Adv
                       For the respondents:      Mr. N. Sarma, SC, Education Dept.
                       Date of Hearing :        07.06.2017.
                      Date of Judgment:        07.06.2017.
                          JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
              Heard Mr. N.N. B. Choudhury, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.
      M. Khataniar, learned Standing Counsel for BTC and Mr. N. Sarma, learned
      Standing Counsel for the Education Department.
      2.      The petitioner was appointed as the second founder teacher of the
      Arnibil Milan L.P School, when the said school was still in its venture stage.
      The petitioner was appointed by the Managing Committee of the school by its
      resolution dated 04.02.1984. Subsequently, when the required inspection was
      carried out by the Inspector of Schools, Nalbari, the name of the petitioner
      appeared in the report.
      3.      The said Arnibil Milan venture L.P School was provincialised as per the
      order dated 15.03.1995 of the Director of Elementary Education, Assam and it
      was provincialised w.e.f. 01.01.1995. But as the respondent authorities had
WP(C) No.4805 of 2012                                                           Page 1 of 3

      not taken any steps for provincialising the service of the petitioner and one
      Naibur Rahman at the time of issuing the order of provincialisation, the
      petitioner as well as the said Naibur Rahman preferred a writ petition before
      this Court being CR No.4900/1995. By the order dated 08.03.1996, the said
      writ petition was disposed of with a direction to the Director of Elementary
      Education, Assam to make an enquiry regarding the averments made in the
      writ petition and thereupon pass appropriate orders on their prayer for
      appointment. Consequent thereof, the aforesaid Naibur Rahman was
      appointed on a monthly stipendiary basis by the order dated 16.12.1999.
      4.      On the other hand, the present writ petitioner was appointed as the
      second founder teacher of the Arnibil Milan L.P School by the order dated
      25.08.2000 of the Deputy Inspector of Schools, Nalbari. Both the aforesaid
      Naibur Rahman as well as the present petitioner were subsequently
      terminated from their services. Naibur Rahman was terminated by an order
      dated 01.12.2008, whereas the present petitioner was terminated by an order
      dated 18.03.2010. The said order of termination dated 18.03.2010 has been
      assailed in this present writ petition with a further prayer that the respondents
      be directed to pay the salary of the petitioner from 2009 onwards.
      5.      In respect of the termination order of 01.12.2008, by which the
      aforesaid Naibur Rahman was terminated, a writ petition was preferred being
      WP(C) No.1242/2010. The said writ petition was disposed of by a judgment
      and order dated 04.08.2016, wherein this Court arrived at a conclusion that
      without entering into the correctness or otherwise of the merit of the
      allegations brought against the petitioner therein, the Court was of the view
      that no notice or reasonable opportunity of hearing was given to the
      petitioner. It was further provided that the services of the petitioner having
      been provincialised, he was entitled to the procedural protection under the
      provisions of Assam Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1964. As the
      required procedure had not been followed and there being violation of
      principles of natural justice, the order of termination dated 01.12.2008 was
      held to be null and void.
      6.      The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the facts and
      circumstances of the appointment as well as termination of the present
      petitioner is same as that of the aforesaid Naibur Rahman. Accordingly, it is
WP(C) No.4805 of 2012                                                            Page 2 of 3

      prayed that a similar view be also taken in the case of the present petitioner
      as has been taken by this Court in its judgment and order dated 04.08.2016
      in WP(C) No.1242/2010.
      7.      After giving a due consideration, this Court is of the view that as the
      facts and circumstances in which the petitioner as well as the aforesaid Naibur
      Rahman had been appointed as well as terminated are same, there is no
      reason for this Court to take a different view from what was taken in the
      judgment and order dated 04.08.2016 in WP(C) No.1242/2010.
      8.      Accordingly, the impugned order of termination dated 18.03.2010 in
      respect of the present petitioner is declared to be null and void for not having
      followed the required procedure and also for violation of the principles of
      natural justice. As provided in the judgment and order dated 04.08.2010, the
      petitioner shall also be entitled to the benefit of the policy decision taken by
      the BTC authorities following the order of this Court passed in Writ Appeal
      No.182/2013.
      9.      Accordingly, the respondent authorities shall consider the case of the
      petitioner for being regularized and further to pay the salary and allowances
      to the petitioner till the date of termination. It is stated by the learned counsel
      for the petitioner that prior to the termination; the petitioner had received his
      salary up to August, 2009. In such view of the matter, the salary and
      allowances of the petitioner shall be paid for the period subsequent to August,
      2009 till the date of his termination.
              A copy of the judgment and order dated 04.08.2016 passed in WP(C)
      No.1242/2010 is kept on record.
              In terms of the above, this writ petition stands disposed of.
                                                                                JUDGE
