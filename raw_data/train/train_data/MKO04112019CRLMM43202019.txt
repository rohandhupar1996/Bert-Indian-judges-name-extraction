CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJ KUMAR OHRI
1.     The present petitions have been filed under Section 482 CrPC
seeking quashing of the order dated 06.05.2019 passed by the Addl.
Sessions Judge, Shahdara District, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi arising
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                              Page 1 of 9

out of CC No.12358 of 2016 and CC No. 12360 of 2016 between the
same parties.
2.      As the parties in the above cases are common and both the
petitions raise identical questions, they are taken up together for disposal.
3.      The short question raised in the present petition is whether non-
framing of formal notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. would vitiate entire
proceedings requiring a fresh trial?
4.      Learned counsel for the petitioner/accused contended that the
respondent/complainant filed the aforementioned complaint case against
the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act.
5.      For the sake of felicity, the chronological list of events as noted by
the revisional court in the impugned order, are reproduced below:-
      “2. The relevant facts for the disposal of the present revision
      petition are that a complaint u/s 138 of Negotiable Instrument
      Act, 1881 (N.I. Act) was filed against the revisionist on
      30.06.2016 for dishonour of the cheque and vide order dated
      14.07.2016 the accused was summoned for the offence u/s 138
      N.I. Act. On 03.11.2016, the counsel for accused filed the
      Memorandum of appearance of the accused. On 10.11.2016
      the accused was exempted and complete set of documents were
      given and the matter was posted for appearance and notice of
      the accused. On 18.11.2016 the counsel for both parties were
      present and they sought for referring for the Mediation Centre.
      On 20.12.2016 it was recorded that the mediation failed and
      counsel for accused sought time for filing application u/s 145
      (2) N.I. Act. On 20.01.2017 no application u/s 145 (2) N.I. Act
      filed and therefore opportunity to cross examine the
      complainant witnesses was closed.
      3. It is also worthwhile to mention that subsequently the
      similar application u/s 145(2) N.I. Act was moved which was
      dismissed vide order dated 25.03.2017 and the matter was
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                              Page 2 of 9

     posted for S.A./DE. The revisionist had preferred the revision
     petition u/s 482 Cr.P.C against the order of Ld. ACMM
     whereby his right to cross-examination was closed. The same
     was dismissed by Hon’ble High Court of Delhi on 04.01.2018.
     Thereafter, the matter was listed for DE and on 05.12.2018
     right to accused to lead DE was closed and matter was posted
     for final arguments, thereafter, the present revision petition
     was moved.”
6.     It is the case of the petitioner that the trial court did not frame any
formal notice either on 20.12.2016 or 20.01.2017 when the petitioner
appeared and this has vitiated the entire trial proceedings. It has been
pleaded that the above fact came to knowledge of the present counsel
who was recently engaged when the case was listed for final arguments.
7.     I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have also gone
through the case records.
8.     It is relevant to note that the present case was fixed for final
arguments before the trial court on 04.02.2019, when the petitioner filed
a revision petition before the Sessions court impugning the order dated
20.12.2016 and 30.01.2017, seeking the following prayers:-
     “a. Call for the record of complaint case pending in the court
     of Sh. Vijay Kumar Jha, KKD courts, Delhi titled as “M/s
     Aakash Metal Industries Vs. Nitin Gupta” vide CC
     no.12360/16 and stay the proceedings in the said case till the
     disposal of the present petition.
     b. Examine the legality and correctness of order dated
     20.12.2016 and 20.01.2017 passed by the Ld. Trial Court in
     case titled as “M/s Aakash Metal Industries Vs. Nitin Gupta”
     vide CC no.12360/16.
     c. Set aside the order dated 20.12.2016 and 20.01.2017 passed
     by the Ld. Trial Court in case titled as “M/s Aakash Metal
     Industries Vs. Nitin Gupta” vide CC no.12360/16 and trial
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                              Page 3 of 9

      court may kindly be directed to proceed with the trial afresh
      after framing of notice U/s 251 CrPC, in the interest of
      Justice.”
9.     A similar revision petition was filed in the second complaint case
as well.
10.    By the impugned order, the Addl. Sessions Judge dismissed both
the revision petitions by holding that it was not necessary to frame a
formal notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C..
11.    Section 251 CrPC reads as follows:-
      “251. Substance of accusation to be stated.—When in a
      summons-case the accused appears or is brought before the
      Magistrate, the particulars of the offence of which he is
      accused shall be stated to him, and he shall be asked whether
      he pleads guilty or has any defence to make, but it shall not be
      necessary to frame a formal charge.”
12.    In terms of Section 143 NI Act, subject to the proviso, as per
normal rule, the proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument
Act are summary in nature. On appearance of the accused, the Magistrate
is required to explain the substance of accusation to the accused and ask
him whether he would plead guilty or has any defence to make, however
in terms of the mandate of the Section, it would not be necessary to
frame a formal notice.
13.    It has neither been pleaded nor argued before this Court that when
the petitioner appeared, the Magistrate did not state the substance of the
accusation to him or did not ask whether he pleaded guilty or wished to
lead any defence evidence. The only argument raised now is that on that
date, no formal notice under Section 251 CrPC was framed by the
Magistrate.
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                          Page 4 of 9

14.     Looking at the issue from another angle as to whether any failure
of justice has occurred on account of non framing of formal Notice under
Section 251 CrPC by the trial court on 20.12.2016. In this regard, it is
profitable to refer to Section 464 CrPC which provides that “no finding,
sentence or order by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed
invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the
ground of any error, omission or irregularity in the charges, unless, in
the opinion of the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of
justice has been occasioned thereby”.
15.     In Sanichar Sahni Vs. State of Bihar reported as (2009) 7 SCC
198, it was held as under:-
      “25. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Willie (William)
      Slaney v. State of M.P. considered the issue of non-framing of
      charges properly and conviction of an accused for the offences
      for which he has not been charged and reached the conclusion
      as under:-
            “86. … In such a situation, the absence of a charge
            under one or other of the various heads of criminal
            liability for the offence cannot be said to be fatal by
            itself, and before a conviction for the substantive
            offence, without a charge, can be set aside,
            prejudice will have to be made out. ....
            87. ..... If it is so grave that prejudice will
            necessarily be implied or imported, it may be
            described as an illegality. If the seriousness of the
            omission is of a lesser degree, it will be an
            irregularity and prejudice by way of failure of
            justice will have to be established”.
      26. This Court in Gurpreet Singh v. State of Punjab referred to
      and relied upon its earlier judgments in Willie (William)
      Slaney and State of A.P. v. Thakkidiram Reddy and held that
      unless there is failure of justice and thereby the cause of the
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                             Page 5 of 9

      accused has been prejudiced, no interference is required if the
      conviction can be upheld on the evidence led against the
      accused. The Court should not interfere unless it is established
      that the accused persons were in any way prejudiced due to
      the errors and omissions in framing the charges against him. A
      similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Ramji Singh
      v. State of Bihar.
      27. Therefore, the law on the issue can be summarized to the
      effect that unless the convict is able to establish that defect in
      framing the charges has caused real prejudice to him and that
      he was not informed as to what was the real case against him
      and that he could not defend himself properly, no interference
      is required on mere technicalities. Conviction order in fact is
      to be tested on the touchstone of prejudice theory.”
16.     On 10.11.2016, the trial court passed the following order:-
      “the complainant to supply the complete set of documents with
      acknowledgment to the accused and one additional set be filed
      on court record. If the copies of documents are not supplied,
      accused can take same from court record.”
17.     The above would indicate that on 10.11.2016, the trial court
directed that the petitioner would be supplied with the entire set of
documents. On a request made, the trial court referred the case for
mediation, which ultimately failed. As such on 20.12.2016, when the
case was taken up by the trial court, the petitioner was fully aware of the
case against him as it has not been argued that on that date, the trial did
not state the substance of accusation to the accused. Rather, at request of
the counsel for the accused, time was granted to file an application under
section 145(2) N.I. Act.
18.     In my opinion, as per mandate of the section 251 CrPC, no formal
notice is required to be framed so long as the substance of the accusation
is stated and the accused is asked whether he pleads guilty or intent to
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                            Page 6 of 9

lead any defence evidence. During the course of arguments, learned
counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out as to what prejudice has
been suffered on account of non framing of a formal notice.
19.    It is relevant to note that the petitioner had approached this court
on an earlier occasion as well vide CRL.M.C. 4463/2017 where he
challenged the order dated 20.12.2016, i.e., the same order which is again
impugned herein, on the ground that his right to cross-examine the
complainant was closed. The aforesaid petition came to be dismissed on
04.01.2018. While noting the conduct of the petitioner, it was held as
under:-
     “8. Keeping in mind the above provisions as well as the
     parameters of this court under Section 482 Cr.P.C., it is found
     as per the facts and circumstances of the present case, the
     petitioner was granted several opportunities to file an
     application under Section 145(2) of NI Act. The first
     opportunity to file an application under Section 145(2) of NI
     Act was granted to the counsel for the petitioner on
     03.11.2016 and thereafter, on 10.11.2016, 18.11.2016,
     20.12.2016 and 21.01.2017. After being provided three
     opportunities to the petitioner to file an application under
     Section 145(2) of NI Act by the court, on 20.12.2016 when the
     petitioner further failed to file the same, he was granted one
     last opportunity subject to the cost of Rs. 10,000/- and matter
     was further list up for 20.01.2017. However, on 20.01.2017,
     the petitioner’s failure to file the same, led to closure of his
     right to cross-examine the respondent/complainant. On
     20.01.2017, the petitioner appeared in the concerned court
     and his appearance is shown in the order dated 20.01.2017,
     when the petitioner’s right to cross-examination was closed by
     the Trial Court.
     9. On perusal of the entire facts and circumstances of the case
     as well as the record, this court is of the view that the
     petitioner was provided with ample opportunities by the Trial
     court to file the said application under Section 145(2) of NI
CRL.M.C. 4320/2019 & CRL.M.C. 4326/2019                           Page 7 of 9

      Act before the concerned court, and only after reasonable
      opportunities were given, the right of the petitioner was
      closed.
      10. Hence, keeping in view the above, no interference by this
      court in impugned order dated 20.01.2017 and 25.03.2017
      passed by the Trial court is called for.”
20.    From above, it is apparent that the petitioner has been found guilty
of causing delay in the trial for one reason or the other. The present case
pertains to a complaint of the year 2016. It appears that earlier, the
petitioner had deliberately raised a piecemeal challenge to the order
dated 20.12.2016 with respect to closure of petitioner’s right to cross-
examine the complainant and now, the very same order is challenged for
non framing of a formal notice under Section 251 CrPC by the trial court.
21.    It is relevant to note that the petitioner’s statement under Section
313 CrPC was recorded on 06.09.2017 and thereafter, the matter was
posted for 16.10.2017 for the purpose of recording defence evidence.
Thereafter, on multiple occasions, the petitioner was granted time to lead
defence evidence. However, no defence evidence was led and eventually
on 05.12.2018, the petitioner’s right to lead defence evidence was closed.
22.    By way of present case, the petitioner has sought to challenge the
impugned order after about 2 & ½ years and that too when the trial is at
the fag end and the case is listed for the final arguments.
23.    The present petition is rather yet another attempt by the petitioner
to delay the trial. Looking at the overall conduct of the petitioner in
delaying the proceedings for one reason or the other, the present petitions
are dismissed with costs of Rs.10,000/- to be paid to the complainant.

24.    The trial court is directed to expedite and conclude the hearing at
earliest.
25.    A copy of this order be sent to the concerned trial court.
