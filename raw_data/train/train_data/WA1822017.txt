                                                     WA No.182 of 2017
                                  BEFORE
           HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
              HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
24.07.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
       Mr.K Bhuyan and Mr. N Islam, learned counsel for the appellant.
       Mr.AC Sarma and Mr.G Bharadwaj, learned counsel for the
       Respondents.
       Heard on admission.
       This intra court appeal is directed against the order dated
20.7.2016 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court,
whereby he has dismissed appellant’s WP(C) No.4169/2016.
       The appellant is facing recovery proceedings before the Debt
Recovery Tribunal, Guwahati. There he filed an application challenging
the maintainability of the original application. The Tribunal dismissed the
application vide order dated 8.6.2016 on the ground that the matter was
at the final hearing stage, and the issues raised by the appellant will be
considered and decided at the time of passing final judgment and order.
Aggrieved, the appellant filed WP(C) No.4169/2016 which too has been
dismissed by the learned Single Judge.
       Admittedly, the matter before the Tribunal is at the final hearing
stage. And the Tribunal has agreed to decide all the issues raised by the
appellant at the time of passing final judgment and order. We, therefore,
having regard to the fact that original case is at the stage of final
argument, find no justification to admit the present appeal. It is
accordingly dismissed summarily.
