                HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE KALYAN RAI SURANA
       Advocates for the Petitioners      : Mr. R.C. Das, Mr. S.C. Das,
                                          : Mr. P. Buragohain.
       Advocates for the Respondents      : Mrs. R. Choudhury, Mr. M. Hussain,
                                          : Ms. A. Begum.
       Date of hearing and Order          : 26.07.2017
                               JUDGMENT AND ORDER
           Heard Mr. R.C. Das, the learned counsel for the petitioners, Mrs. R.
Choudhury, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents No.1 to 3 and Mr.
S.P. Choudhury, the learned State Counsel appearing for the respondents No.4 to
7.
2)         From the copy of the judgment dated 23.12.1987, passed by the
learned Assistant District Judge, Dhubri, in T.S. No. 32/1983, the Respondents
No.1 and 2 are the plaintiffs in TS No. 32/1983. The suit was for declaration and
cancellation of sale deed, and 19 persons were arrayed as Defendants. The suit
was decreed on 23.12.1987.
CRP 371/2016                                                                    Page 1 of 4

3)          The predecessor-in – interest of the petitioners, namely, Dinesh
Chandra Das was arrayed as Defendant No.15.He preferred an appeal, being T.A.
No. 9/1994, which was allowed by first appellate judgment and decree dated
06.04.1995, thereby allowing his land purchased from defendants No.1 and 2 to
stand excluded from partition. The plaintiffs assailed the same by filing second
appeal, which was numbered as S.A. No. 101/95. This court, by judgment dated
11.01.2001, allowed the appeal by setting aside that part of the first appellate
judgment by which the land of the land of the predecessor- in- interest of the
petitioners was ordered to stand excluded from partition.
4)          During the pendency of proceedings of T. Ex. Case No. 2/2002, the
Settlement Officer, Dhubri and Kokrajhar Districts, vide (i) letter No. DKSR.
36/2003/57 dated 12.05.2015, and (ii) letter No. DKSR.36/2003/60(A) dated
20.06.2016, directed the Assistant Settlement Officer, Bilasipara, to restore the
name of petitioners No.1 and 2 in the Draft and Main Chitha by deleting the
names of the respondents No.1 and 2 herein and to issue a separate patta. This
order was assailed by the respondents No.1 and 2 herein before the Board of
Revenue, Assam by filing appeal under the provisions of Regulation 147(a) read
with Regulation 150 if the Assam Land & Revenue Regulation, 1886. The said
appeal was numbered as Appeal No. 78RA (DBR)/ 2016. The said proceeding as
well as order dated 06.09.2016, admitting the appeal and passing ad-interim stay
is challenged by the petitioners by filing this application under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India on the ground of being barred by res-judicata. It is
projected that the petitioners had also assailed the same order before this Court
by filing writ petition, being W.P.(C) No. 4287/16.
5)          The learned counsels for the parties including the petitioner No.6 in-
person have been heard at length. Owing to the nature of order being proposed
to be passed, there is no need to burden this order with their lengthy arguments.
CRP 371/2016                                                                    Page 2 of 4

6)          This Court in the case of Nongpok Sekmai Collective Farming Co-
operative Society Ltd. &Ors. V. Sekmai Khumbi Joint Farming Co-operative
Society Ltd. & Ors., AIR 1981 Gau 55, had declined to intervene under Article
227 of the Constitution of India, when there is no miscarriage of justice. In the
case of Radha Mohan Pathak V. Upendra Patowary, AIR 1962 Gau 71, the
Division Bench of this Court had upheld the preliminary objection on
maintainability of a Letters Patent Appeal against the order passed by the Board
of Revenue. In the case of (i) Mustt. Peshu Bewa V. Assam Board of Revenue,
Guwahati & Ors., (1981) 1 GLR 184, and (ii) Darrang Industrial Corporation,
Darrang, Tezpur & Ors. V. Assam Board of Revenue & Ors., (1982) 1 GLR 166,
the Division Bench of this court had entertained writ petitions against the order
passed by the Assam Board of Revenue. Till the recent time, in the case of
Bikram Phukan V. The State of Assam & Ors., Writ Appeal No. 295/2016, decided
on 05.09.2015, shows that this Court had been entertaining writ petition against
the order passed by the Assam Board of Revenue. There is no material on record
to show that the Assam Board of Revenue has been held to be either a Court or
a Tribunal and, as such, without giving any finding on the issue, it is left open to
be decided in appropriate case as to whether the Assam Board of Revenue is a
Court or a Tribunal to make its orders amenable to extra-ordinary supervisory
jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
7)          In the present case, it is seen that the petitioner has not moved the
Assam Board of Revenue on the issue of maintainability of the proceedings of
78(RA)(DBR)/2016 or for recalling the order dated 06.09.2016, issuing process
on the respondents therein and, as such, the issue whether the said proceeding
is barred by res-judicata cannot be decided by this Court as if it was exercising
an original jurisdiction as a court of fact and when there is no finding on the
issue sought to be raised herein, which can be said to be irrational or perverse or
vitiated by error. Hence, this is not found to be a fit case for exercising extra-
ordinary jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. In this regard,
I find support from the case of Jogendrasinghji Vijaysinghji V. State of Gujarat,
CRP 371/2016                                                                     Page 3 of 4

(2015) 9 SCC 1, the Hon’ble Apex Court has, inter-alia, held that jurisdiction
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is available only to adjudicate on
the validity of judicial acts and that it is not an appellate but a supervisory
jurisdiction and that a superior court can only set aside or quash an order
without jurisdiction or palpably erroneous order, but it cannot substitute its own
views for those of the inferior court or tribunal. Hence, in the opinion of this
Court, without the issue maintainability being raised before the Assam Board of
Revenue, there is no assailable order in existence.
8)          Hence, in view of the discussion above, this application stands
dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own cost.
9)          At this stage, the petitioners’ side has referred to the following case
citations as mentioned below. However, in view of the discussion above, the said
cases are not found to be of any assistance to the petitioner under the facts and
circumstances of this case. The cases are: (i) K.P. Ranga Rao vs. K.V.
Venkatesham & Ors., (2015) 13 SCC 514, (ii) Harshad Chiman Lal Modi vs. DLF

Ors., (1981) 3 SCC 589, (v) Mannappa Manikappa Sheded & Ors. vs.
