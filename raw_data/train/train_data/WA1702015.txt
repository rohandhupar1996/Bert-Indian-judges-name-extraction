                                   BEFORE
             HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
               HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN

(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
         Mr.BD Konwar, learned senior counsel, assisted by Mr. R Phukan
         and Mr. R Saloi, learned counsel for the appellant.
         Mr.A   Chamua,     learned   counsel    for   the   University   Grants
         Commission (Respondent No.1), Mr. NJ Khataniar, learned counsel
         for Respondent Nos.2 and 3, Mr. M Saikia, learned counsel for
         Respondent Nos.4, 5 and 6 and Mr. A Biswas, learned counsel for
         Respondent No.7.
         This intra court appeal is directed against the order dated
1.6.2015 passed by the learned Single Judge of this High Court, whereby
he has allowed WP(C) No.788/2012 of Respondent No.7.
         In response to the advertisement dated 1.7.2011 issued by the
Director, Higher Education, Assam, as many as 17 candidates, including
the appellant and Respondent No.7, applied for the post of Assistant
Professor, Lakhimpur Girls’ College. The candidates were interviewed on
31.7.2011 by a Selection Committee comprising of 7 eminent members.
Thereafter, on its recommendation the appellant was appointed vide
order     dated   22.9.2011.Aggrieved,      Respondent      No.7  filed   WP(C)
No.788/2012 alleging that appellant was not eligible for the post as she
was not a Ph.D Degree holder and also for not having passed State Level
Eligibility Test (SLET) or National Eligibility Test (NET) in terms of the
University Grants Commission Regulations.
         It appears that in the writ petition, affidavit-in-opposition was filed
only by the University Grants Commission and no representation was
                                                                       Page 1 of 3

made by the appellant. The learned Single Judge having regard to the
averments made by Respondent No.7 in his writ petition, quashed the
select list prepared by the Selection Committee recommending the name
of appellant and instead directed to consider the name of Respondent
No.7 for appointment. It is in this background, the appellant has filed the
present appeal.
         It is true that as per University Grants Commission guidelines for
recruitment and qualification to the post of Assistant Professor, minimum
eligibility condition was qualifying in the National Eligibility Test or State
Level Eligibility Test. It is also true that vide Resolutions dated 12.8.2010
and 27.9.2010, the University Grants Commission exempted pre-2009
M.Phil/Ph.D degree holders for appointment to the post of Assistant
Professor from qualifying National Eligibility Test or State Level Eligibility
Test. And these Resolutions were adopted by the Government of Assam
vide notification dated 1.1.2011. This means that on 31.7.2011, when
the Selection Committee recommended the name of appellant, who is
M.Phil degree holder, it bonafidely believed that he was exempted from
qualifying National Eligibility Test or State Level Eligibility Test. However,
later, the University Grants Commission, vide Public Notice dated
12.10.2012, after about 1 year of appellant’s appointment, clarified that
Resolutions dated 12.8.2010 and 27.9.2010 were not concurred by the
Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India and
were therefore not given any force. And acting upon this clarification, the
Government of Assam, vide notification dated 22.3.2017, withdrew its
earlier notification dated 1.1.2011 but only with effect from 22.3.2017.
         The appellant is reportedly functioning as Assistant Professor since
last more than 5 ½ years without any complaint. It is not the case of
Respondent No.7 that the appellant had obtained the appointment either
by playing fraud or misrepresentation. She, therefore, cannot be made
victim of the confusion created by the University Grants Commission.
Now, even, Respondent No.7 has been given permanent employment in
the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) on a higher pay
                                                                      Page 2 of 3

scale and he is no more interested in the post, in question. For these
reasons, we find no justification to unsettle the appointment of appellant.
We, accordingly, set aside the impugned order passed by the learned
Single Judge. We, however, make it clear that this order shall not be
treated as precedent.
