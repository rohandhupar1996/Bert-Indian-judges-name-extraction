:     PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
1.          The appeal under Section 173 of the M.V. Act 1988 is
directed against the award dated 30.4.90. Appellant Virender
Singh seeks enhancement of the compensation awarded on
account of injuries sustained at a road accident on 22.11.1980
involving bus No. DEP-2672.
2.          Injured was aged 26 years at the time of the accident.
He was working as a sepoy in the Indian army and was drawing a
salary of Rs.454.45 per month.
3.          Because of the accident, injured suffered serious head
FAO No.192/90                                               1 of 10

injuries resulting in paralysis of left side of body and 100%
permanent disability. Besides physical injuries, he also suffered
various neurological disorders such as loss of memory, loss in
concentration power etc.
4.          Injured remained hospitalized in the Army Hospital for
a period from 22.11.82 to 30.5.83 i.e. nearly 6 months. He
remained unconscious for a period of about 2 months.
5.          It is an admitted fact that after the accident the
appellant was discharged from the army because of 100%
physical disability sustained by him.
6.          Noting that the injured had claimed compensation in
sum of Rs.1,00,000/- in the claim petition, Tribunal has awarded
compensation      of  Rs.1,00,000/-   to the   injured.  The    said
compensation is not under any head but is a lump sum
compensation. There is no discussion in the award pertaining to
the assessment of compensation.
7.          Aggrieved by the quantum of compensation, injured
has filed the present appeal.
8.          The learned senior counsel for the injured submitted
that in fixing the compensation the Tribunal has not followed the
principles laid down in various decisions pertaining to disability
suffered by persons injured in road accidents.
9.          Under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 there
is no restriction that compensation could be awarded only up to
the amount claimed by the claimant. In an appropriate case
FAO No.192/90                                              2 of 10

where from the evidence brought on record if Tribunal/Court
considers that claimant is entitled to get more compensation than
claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award. Only embargo is that
compensation should be a 'just' compensation', that is to say, it
should be neither arbitrary, fanciful nor unjustifiable from the
evidence. (See decision of the Supreme Court in the report
published as Nagappa v Gurudayal Singh, AIR 2003 SC 674.)
10.          Thus,   the  approach   of  the  learned    Tribunal    in
determining compensation only on the basis of amount of
compensation claimed in the claim petition and not appreciating
evidence led by the injured is incorrect.
11.          The possession of one's own body is the first and most
valuable of all human rights and while awarding compensation for
bodily injuries this primary element is to be kept in mind. Bodily
injuries is to be treated as a deprivation which entitles a claimant
to damages.
12.          Tribunals constituted under the Act are required to
make an award of compensation which has to be just. The Courts
and Tribunals have a duty to weigh the various factors and
quantify the compensation, which should be just. What would be a
just compensation is a vexed question. Every method or mode
adopted for assessing compensation has to be considered in the
background       of  just  compensation    which   is   the   pivotal
consideration. The determination has to be rational, to be done by
a judicious approach and not the outcome of whims, wild guesses
FAO No.192/90                                                3 of 10

and arbitrariness. The expression just denotes equitability,
fairness and reasonableness and non-arbitrary.
13.         Compensation for loss of limb or life can hardly be
weighed in golden scales. There can be no golden rule applicable
to all the cases for measuring the value of human life or a limb.
The measure of damages cannot be arrived at by a precise
mathematical calculations. It would depend upon the particular
facts and circumstances and attending peculiar or special
features, if any. The quantum of damages fixed should be in
accordance to the injury.
14.         The thumb rule which govern the assessment of
damages in personal injury cases is that the Court should award
to an injured person such a sum as will put him in the position as
he would have been in if he had not sustained the injuries.
15.         In the light of afore-noted judicial position and
backdrop facts, I shall assess the compensation to be awarded to
the injured.
16.         Broadly  speaking,    while fixing  an    amount        of
compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages
have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and non-
pecuniary damages.
17.         Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has
actually incurred and which is capable of being calculated in
terms of money. Pecuniary damages are easy to determine as a
Tribunal would have some imperical data before it.
FAO No.192/90                                               4 of 10

18.           Pecuniary damages includes the following:-
         (i) Special damages or pre-trial pecuniary loss.
         (ii) Prospective loss of earnings and profits.
         (iii) Medicinal expenses.
         (iv) Cost of future care and other expenses.
19.           Loss of salary during period of hospitalization:-         As
already noted, injured remained hospitalized for a period of nearly
6 months.      Since injured was not in a position to attend to his
official duties during the period of hospitalization, he needs to be
recompensed for loss of salary during that period. Salary of the
injured at the time of the accident was Rs.454/- per month. Loss
of salary during hospitalization period comes to Rs.454/- x 6 =
Rs.2724/- per month.
20.           Medicinal Expenses:- There is no evidence to show the
expenses incurred by the injured on his treatment.            However,
noting that he remained hospitalized for a period of 6 months; he
remained unconscious for a period of 2 months; 100% permanent
disability suffered by him, I consider it reasonable to award a sum
of Rs.10,000/- towards medicinal expenses.
21.           Loss of future prospects:- It is an admitted fact that the
injured was dismissed from the army because of 100% permanent
disability sustained by him on account of the accident. Further,
because appellant suffered paralysis of left side of his body he
has become incapacitated to do any work. Therefore he has to be
awarded compensation under said head.
FAO No.192/90                                                   5 of 10

22.         I note that the injured started getting pension in sum of
Rs.141/- per month. The salary of the injured was Rs.454/- per
month. Loss of income comes to Rs.454/- â€“ Rs.141/- = Rs.313/-
per month.
23.         It is now well settled that while estimating future loss
of income, the Court has to take into account the prospects of
future increase in the income of the injured.       (See K.Narsimha
Murthi vs. The Manager, Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. & Anr. 2004
ACJ 1109)
24.         Considering that the injured was aged 26 years at the
time of the accident, I consider it reasonable to assume that his
salary would have doubled by the time he would have left gainful
employment. Thus, mean average loss of income of the injured
comes to Rs.470/- per month.
25.         Noting the age of the injured, I consider multiplier of 17
as appropriate. My reasons for so holding is the decision of the
Supreme Court in the report published as U.P. State Road
Transport Corporation vs. Trilok Chandra & Ors.        (1996) 4 SCC
362.   In the said decision, Supreme Court has held that the
highest multiplier of 18 has to be applied for the age group of 21
years to 25 years.
26.         Applying multiplier 17, loss of future income comes to
Rs.470 x 12 x 17 = Rs.95,880/-.
27.         Thus, compensation under the said head comes to
Rs.95,880/-.
FAO No.192/90                                                 6 of 10

28.         Future care, attendant expenses:- Because of 100%
permanent disability, injured has become bed ridden therefore he
would require constant care and attention for rest of his life.       I
award compensation in sum of Rs.50,000/- under the said head.
29.         Unlike pecuniary damages, non-pecuniary damages
are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations.
30.         Non pecuniary damages includes the following:-
(i)         Pain and suffering.
(ii)        Damages for mental and physical shock.
(iii)       Loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of
matters i.e. on account of injury the injured may not be able to
walk, run or sit etc.
(iv)        Loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of injury
normal longevity of the life of the person concerned is shortened.
(v)         Disfigurement.
(vi)        Discomfort       or       inconvenience,       hardship,
disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life.
31.         Pain and suffering:- Pain and suffering compensates
victim for the physical and mental discomfort caused by the
injury. Pain is physical; suffering is emotional. While pain is the
physiological     response   to    certain  stimuli,   suffering     is
psychological or emotional response to pain.
32.         In the decision reported as R.D.Hattangadi vs. Pest
Control (India) Pvt. Ltd. 1995 ACJ 366 because of the accident, the
appellant in said case became a paraplegic and suffered 100%
FAO No.192/90                                                7 of 10

permanent disability. Date of accident was 20.5.1980. Appellant
in said case had remained hospitalized for a period from
20.5.1980 to 2.8.1980.         Analyzing the law relating to non-
pecuniary damages, compensation in sum of Rs.1,50,000/- was
awarded under the head 'pain and suffering'.
33.         In the light of Hattangadi's case (supra); noting the
period of hospitalization of injured; the 100% physical disability
suffered by him, I award compensation in sum of Rs.1,50,000/-
under the head 'pain and suffering'.
34.         Loss of expectation of life:- Compensation for loss of
expectation of life compensates victim for the limitation, resulting
from the defendant's negligence, on the injured person's ability to
participate in and derive pleasure from the normal activities of
daily life, or the individual's inability to pursue his talents,
recreational interests, hobbies or avocations.             In essence,
compensation for loss of expectation of life compensates an
individual for loss of life and loss of the pleasures of living.
35.         In the Hattangadi's case (supra) compensation in sum
of  Rs.1,50,000/-     were    awarded     under  the   head    'loss     of
expectation of life'.
36.         On the same analogy, I consider it reasonable to award
compensation in sum of Rs.1,50,000/- under the head 'loss of
expectation of life'.
37.         Depression and mental stress in life:- A person not only
suffers injuries on account of the accident but also suffers in mind
FAO No.192/90                                                    8 of 10

and body on account of the accident through out his life and a
feeling is developed that he is no more a normal man and cannot
enjoy the amenities of life as another normal person can.                      The
appellant is reduced to a vegetable existence.                         I award
compensation in sum of Rs.50,000/- under the said head.
38.         Loss of marriage prospects:- It is an admitted fact that
the injured has remained unmarried on account of 100%
permanent disability suffered by him. I award compensation in
sum of Rs.1,00,000/- under the said head.
39.         Total compensation payable to the injured comes as
under:-
(a)   Loss of salary during the period of
      hospitalization                               = Rs.2724/-.
(b)   Medicinal expenses                            = Rs.10,000/-.
(c)   Loss of future income                         =Rs.95,880/-.
(d)   Future care and attendant expenses = Rs.50,000/-.
(e)   Pain and suffering                            = Rs.1,50,000/-.
(f)   Loss of amenities of life                     = Rs.1,50,000/-.
(g)   Depression and mental stress in life          = Rs.50,000/-.
(h)   Loss of marriage prospects                    = Rs.1,00,000/-.
                             -----------------------------------------------
                                            Total = Rs.6,08,604/-
40.         The Tribunal has awarded compensation in sum of
Rs.1,00,000/-. Thus compensation stands enhanced by a sum of
Rs.5,08,604/-.
41.         Enhanced compensation in sum of Rs.5,08,604/- shall
FAO No.192/90                                                            9 of 10

be paid together with interest @7.5% per annum from date of
claim petition till realization.
42.         It is further directed that enhanced compensation
together with accrued interest thereon shall be deposited in a
fixed deposit with a nationalized bank for a period of 5 years.
Liberty is granted to the injured/appellant to withdraw the interest
accrued thereon.
43.         Appeal stands disposed of.
44.         No costs.
