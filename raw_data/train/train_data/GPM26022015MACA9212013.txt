                           Through: Mr. J.P.N. Shahi, Adv.

                           JUDGMENT
G. P. MITTAL, J.
1.      The appeal is for reduction of compensation of `15,47,308/-
        awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (the Claims
        Tribunal) in favour of Respondents no.1 to 9 for the death of
        Mohan Lal, who suffered fatal injuries in a motor vehicular
        accident which occurred on 06.08.2011 at about 12:30 p.m. near
        Mangol Puri Railway Line Flyover, Mangol Puri, Delhi.
2.      The finding on negligence is not challenged by the Appellant
        Insurance Company.

3.      During inquiry before the Claims Tribunal, it was claimed that
        the deceased was working as a labourer and was earning
        `10,000/- per month.     In the absence of any evidence with
        regard to deceased’s income, his income was taken as `6422/-
        per month on the basis of minimum wages and addition of 30%
        was made towards future prospects to compute the loss of
        dependency at `12,62,308/-.
4.      On awarding certain sums towards non-pecuniary damages, the
        overall compensation of `15,47,308/- was awarded to the
        Respondents no.1 to 9 (the Claimants).
5.      It is urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant that in the
        absence of any evidence with regard to good future prospects,
        no addition towards the same was permissible. It is also
        contended that once the compensation of `1,00,000/- each was
        awarded towards loss of consortium and loss of love and
        affection, award of compensation for loss of gratuitous services
        was not permissible. It is further urged that since the number of
        family members were 9 including 8 dependants, deduction
        towards personal and living expenses ought to have been 1/5 th
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                Page 2 of 19

        instead of 1/10th taken by the Claims Tribunal.
6.      The appeal must succeed on all three grounds.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
7.      As far as future prospects are concerned, proposition of law laid
        down in Sarla Verma (Smt.) & Ors. v. Delhi Transport
        Corporation & Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121 that there will be
        addition of 50% and 30% towards future prospects when a
        victim is in settled employment having bright future prospects
        like government service in the age group of upto 40 years and
        above 40 years but less than 50 years respectively was affirmed
        by a three Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in
        Reshma Kumari & Ors. v. Madan Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC
        65. The question of grant of future prospects was also dealt with
        by this Court at great length in HDFC Ergo General Insurance
        Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Lalta Devi and Ors., MAC APP No. 189/ 2014
        decided on 12.01.2015 and it was held that the three Judge
        Bench decision in Reshma Kumari (supra) shall be taken as a
        binding precedent. Paras 8 to 21 of the report in Lalta Devi

        (supra) are extracted hereunder:
                   “8. It is no gainsaying that in appropriate cases
                   some addition towards future prospects must be
                   made in case of death or injury of a person
                   pursuing a professional course. At the same time, it
                   cannot be laid down as a uniform principle that
                   every person pursuing professional course will have
                   a bright future. There may be a student pursuing
                   engineering from the reputed engineering colleges
                   like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Regional
                   Engineering College or any other reputed college.
                   At the same time, a number of engineering Colleges
                   have mushroomed where an engineering graduate
                   may find it difficult to secure a job of an engineer.
                   In the instant case, deceased Aditya, as stated
                   earlier was a student of an unknown engineering
                   college, i.e. Echelon Institute of Technology,
                   Faridabad which is claimed to be affiliated to
                   Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak. The
                   Claimants have placed on record result-cum-
                   detailed marks card of First and Second Semester.
                   It may be noted that the deceased had secured just
                   ordinary marks in seven subjects and he had to re-
                   appear in papers 1002 (Mathematical-I), 1006
                   (Foundation of Computer & Programming) and
                   1008 (Basics of Mechanical Engineering).
                   Similarly, in the Second Semester the deceased was
                   absent in one of the 12 papers and out of 11
                   subjects for which he had taken examination, he
                   was to re-appear in four subjects. Thus, it will be
                   difficult to say that the deceased was a brilliant

                   student or that he was pursuing engineering from a
                   well known or even mediocre college.
                   9.     The learned counsel for the Claimants has
                   referred to a three Judge Bench decision of the
                   Supreme Court in Rajesh & Ors. v. Rajbir Singh &
                   Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 54 to contend that the future
                   prospects have to be added in all cases where a
                   person is getting fixed wages or is a seasonal
                   employee or is a student.
                   10. It is urged by the learned counsel for the
                   Claimants that the law laid down in Sarla Verma
                   (Smt.) & Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation &
                   Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121 was extended in Rajesh &
                   Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 54 to
                   hold that future prospects ought to be extended in
                   all cases.
                   11. On the other hand, the learned counsel for
                   the Insurance Company refers to a three Judge
                   Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Reshma
                   Kumari & Ors. v. Madan Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9
                   SCC 65 wherein while approving the ratio with
                   regard to future prospects in Sarla Verma (Smt.) &

                   as under:-

                   for future prospects, in Sarla Verma [Sarla

                   this Court has noted the earlier decisions

                   SCC p. 134):
                       “24. … In view of the imponderables
                       and uncertainties, we are in favour of
                       adopting as a rule of thumb, an
                       addition of 50% of actual salary to
                       the actual salary income of the
                       deceased towards future prospects,
                       where the deceased had a permanent
                       job and was below 40 years. (Where
                       the annual income is in the taxable
                       range, the words „actual salary‟
                       should be read as „actual salary less
                       tax‟). The addition should be only
                       30% if the age of the deceased was 40
                       to 50 years. There should be no
                       addition, where the age of the
                       deceased is more than 50 years.
                       Though the evidence may indicate a

                       different percentage of increase, it is
                       necessary to standardise the addition
                       to avoid different yardsticks being
                       applied or different methods of
                       calculation being adopted. Where the
                       deceased was self-employed or was
                       on a fixed salary (without provision
                       for annual increments, etc.), the
                       courts will usually take only the
                       actual income at the time of death. A
                       departure therefrom should be made
                       only in rare and exceptional cases
                       involving special circumstances.”
                   39. The standardization of addition to
                   income for future prospects shall help in
                   achieving certainty in arriving at
                   appropriate compensation. We approve the
                   method that an addition of 50% of actual
                   salary be made to the actual salary income
                   of the deceased towards future prospects
                   where the deceased had a permanent job
                   and was below 40 years and the addition
                   should be only 30% if the age of the
                   deceased was 40 to 50 years and no addition
                   should be made where the age of the
                   deceased is more than 50 years. Where the
                   annual income is in the taxable range, the
                   actual salary shall mean actual salary less
                   tax. In the cases where the deceased was
                   self-employed or was on a fixed salary
                   without provision for annual increments, the
                   actual income at the time of death without
                   any addition to income for future prospects

                       will be appropriate. A departure from the
                       above principle can only be justified in
                       extraordinary circumstances and very
                       exceptional cases.”
                   12. The learned counsel for the Insurance
                   Company relies upon a Constitutional Bench
                   judgment of the Supreme Court in Central Board
                   of Dawoodi Bohra Community & Anr. v. State of
                   Maharashtra & Anr., (2005) 2 SCC 673; Safiya
                   Bee v. Mohd. Vajahath Hussain @ Fasi, (2011) 2
                   SCC 94; and Union of India & Ors. v. S.K.
                   Kapoor, (2011) 4 SCC 589 to contend that in case
                   of divergence of opinion in judgments of benches
                   of co-equal strength, earlier judgment will be
                   taken as a binding precedent.
                   13. It may be noted that in Reshma Kumari &
                   Ors. v. Madan Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 65;
                   the three Judge Bench was dealing with a
                   reference made by a two Judge Bench (S.B. Sinha
                   and Cyriac Joseph, J.J.). The two Hon‟ble Judges
                   wanted an authoritative pronouncement from a
                   Larger Bench on the question of applicability of
                   the multiplier and whether the inflation was built
                   in the multiplier. The three Judge Bench approved
                   the two Judge Bench decision of the Supreme
                   Court in Sarla Verma (Smt.) & Ors. v. Delhi
                   Transport Corporation & Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121
                   with regard to the selection of multiplier. It
                   further laid down that addition towards future
                   prospects to the extent of 50% of the actual salary
                   shall be made towards future prospects when the
                   deceased had a permanent job and was below 40

                   years and addition of 30% should be made if the
                   age of the deceased was between 40-50 years. No
                   addition towards future prospects shall be made
                   where the deceased was self-employed or was
                   getting a fixed salary without any provision of
                   annual increment.
                   14. Of course, three Judge Bench of the
                   Supreme Court in its later judgment in Rajesh
                   relying on Santosh Devi v. National Insurance
                   Company Ltd. & Ors., 2012 (6) SCC 421 observed
                   that there would be addition of 30% and 50%,
                   depending upon the age of the deceased, towards
                   future prospects even in the case of self-employed
                   persons. It may, however, be noted that in Rajesh,
                   the three Judge Bench decision in Reshma Kumari
                   (supra) was not brought to the notice of their
                   Lordships.
                   15. The divergence of opinion was noted by
                   another three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court
                   in Sanjay Verma v. Haryana Roadways, (2014) 3
                   SCC 210. In paras 14 and 15, the Supreme Court
                   observed as under:-
                      “14. Certain parallel developments will now
                      have to be taken note of. In Reshma
                      Kumari v. Madan Mohan [(2009) 13 SCC
                      422 : (2009) 5 SCC (Civ) 143 : (2010) 1
                      SCC (Cri) 1044], a two-Judge Bench of this
                      Court while considering the following
                      questions took the view that the issue(s)
                      needed resolution by a larger Bench: (SCC

                       “(1) Whether the multiplier specified
                       in the Second Schedule appended to
                       the Act should be scrupulously applied
                       in all the cases?
                       (2) Whether for determination of the
                       multiplicand, the Act provides for any
                       criterion, particularly as regards
                       determination of future prospects?”
                   15. Answering the above reference a three-
                   Judge Bench of this Court in Reshma
                   Kumari v. Madan Mohan [(2013) 9 SCC 65
                   : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2013) 3 SCC
                   (Cri) 826] (SCC p. 88, para 36) reiterated
                   the view taken in Sarla Verma [Sarla
                   Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121 : (2009) 2
                   SCC (Civ) 770 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 1002]
                   to the effect that in respect of a person who
                   was on a fixed salary without provision for
                   annual increments or who was self-employed
                   the actual income at the time of death should
                   be taken into account for determining the
                   loss of income unless there are
                   extraordinary          and         exceptional
                   circumstances. Though the expression
                   “exceptional          and        extraordinary
                   circumstances” is not capable of any precise
                   definition, in Shakti Devi v. New India
                   Insurance Co. Ltd. [(2010) 14 SCC 575 :
                   (2012) 1 SCC (Civ) 766 : (2011) 3 SCC
                   (Cri) 848] there is a practical application of
                   the aforesaid principle. The near certainty of
                   the regular employment of the deceased in a
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                Page 10 of 19

                    government department following the
                    retirement of his father was held to be a
                    valid ground to compute the loss of income
                    by taking into account the possible future
                    earnings. The said loss of income,
                    accordingly, was quantified at double the
                    amount that the deceased was earning at the
                    time of his death.”
        16. Further, the divergence of opinion in Reshma
        Kumari & Ors. v. Madan Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC
        65 and Rajesh & Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors., (2013) 9
        SCC 54 was noticed by the Supreme Court in another
        latest judgment in National Insurance Company Ltd. v.
        Pushpa & Ors., CC No.8058/2014, decided on
        02.07.2014 and in concluding paragraph while making
        reference to the Larger Bench, the Supreme Court held
        as under:-
             “Be it noted, though the decision in Reshma
             (supra) was rendered at earlier point of time, as is
             clear, the same has not been noticed in Rajesh
             (supra) and that is why divergent opinions have
             been expressed. We are of the considered opinion
             that as regards the manner of addition of income of
             future prospects there should be an authoritative
             pronouncement. Therefore, we think it appropriate
             to refer the matter to a larger Bench.”
        17. Now, the question is which of the judgments ought
        to be followed awaiting answer to the reference made by
        the Supreme Court in Pushpa & Ors. (supra).

        18. In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community &
        Anr. v. State of Maharashtra & Anr., (2005) 2 SCC 673
        in para 12, the Supreme Court observed as under:-
             “12. Having carefully considered the submissions
             made by the learned Senior Counsel for the parties
             and having examined the law laid down by the
             Constitution Benches in the abovesaid decisions,
             we would like to sum up the legal position in the
             following terms:
                   (1) The law laid down by this Court in a
                   decision delivered by a Bench of larger strength
                   is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or
                   coequal strength.
                   (2) [Ed.: Para 12(2) corrected vide Official
                   Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./21/2005 dated 3-
                   3-2005.] A Bench of lesser quorum cannot
                   disagree or dissent from the view of the law
                   taken by a Bench of larger quorum. In case of
                   doubt all that the Bench of lesser quorum can
                   do is to invite the attention of the Chief Justice
                   and request for the matter being placed for
                   hearing before a Bench of larger quorum than
                   the Bench whose decision has come up for
                   consideration. It will be open only for a Bench
                   of coequal strength to express an opinion
                   doubting the correctness of the view taken by
                   the earlier Bench of coequal strength,
                   whereupon the matter may be placed for
                   hearing before a Bench consisting of a quorum
                   larger than the one which pronounced the
                   decision laying down the law the correctness of
                   which is doubted.
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                    Page 12 of 19

                   (3) [Ed.: Para 12(3) corrected vide Official
                   Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./7/2005 dated 17-
                   1-2005.] The above rules are subject to two
                   exceptions: (i) the abovesaid rules do not bind
                   the discretion of the Chief Justice in whom vests
                   the power of framing the roster and who can
                   direct any particular matter to be placed for
                   hearing before any particular Bench of any
                   strength; and (ii) in spite of the rules laid down
                   hereinabove, if the matter has already come up
                   for hearing before a Bench of larger quorum
                   and that Bench itself feels that the view of the
                   law taken by a Bench of lesser quorum, which
                   view is in doubt, needs correction or
                   reconsideration then by way of exception (and
                   not as a rule) and for reasons given by it, it may
                   proceed to hear the case and examine the
                   correctness of the previous decision in question
                   dispensing with the need of a specific reference
                   or the order of the Chief Justice constituting the
                   Bench and such listing. Such was the situation
                   in Raghubir Singh [(1989) 2 SCC 754] and
                   Hansoli Devi [(2002) 7 SCC 273].”
        19. Similarly, in Safiya Bee v. Mohd. Vajahath
        Hussain @ Fasi, (2011) 2 SCC 94 in para 27, the
        Supreme Court observed as under:-
             “27. However, even assuming that the decision in
             WP No. 35561 of 1998 did not operate as res
             judicata, we are constrained to observe that even if
             the learned Judges who decided WP No. 304 of
             2001 did not agree with the view taken by a
             coordinate Bench of equal strength in the earlier
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                    Page 13 of 19

             WP No. 35561 of 1998 regarding the interpretation
             of Section 2(c) of the Act and its application to the
             petition schedule property, judicial discipline and
             practice required them to refer the issue to a larger
             Bench. The learned Judges were not right in
             overruling the statement of the law by a coordinate
             Bench of equal strength. It is an accepted rule or
             principle that the statement of the law by a Bench
             is considered binding on a Bench of the same or
             lesser number of Judges. In case of doubt or
             disagreement about the decision of the earlier
             Bench, the well-accepted and desirable practice is
             that the later Bench would refer the case to a
             larger Bench.”
        20. In Union of India & Ors. v. S.K. Kapoor, (2011) 4
        SCC 589 while holding that the decision of the Co-
        ordinate Bench is binding on the subsequent Bench of
        equal strength, held that the Bench of Co-ordinate
        strength can only make a reference to a larger Bench. In
        para 9 of the report, the Supreme Court held as under:-
             “9. It may be noted that the decision in S.N. Narula
             case [(2011) 4 SCC 591] was prior to the decision
             in T.V. Patel case [(2007) 4 SCC 785 : (2007) 2
             SCC (L&S) 98] . It is well settled that if a
             subsequent coordinate Bench of equal strength
             wants to take a different view, it can only refer the
             matter to a larger Bench, otherwise the prior
             decision of a coordinate Bench is binding on the
             subsequent Bench of equal strength. Since, the
             decision in S.N. Narula case [(2011) 4 SCC 591]
             was not noticed in T.V. Patel case [(2007) 4 SCC
             785 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 98] , the latter decision
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                 Page 14 of 19

             is a judgment per incuriam. The decision in S.N.
             Narula case [(2011) 4 SCC 591] was binding on
             the subsequent Bench of equal strength and hence,
             it could not take a contrary view, as is settled by a
             series of judgments of this Court.”
        21. This Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.
        Harpal Singh & Ors., MAC APP.138/2011, decided on
        06.09.2013, went into this question and held that in view
        of the report in S.K. Kapoor (supra), the three Judge
        Bench decision in Reshma Kumari & Ors. (supra) shall
        be taken as a binding precedent.”
8.      Divergence of opinion in Reshma Kumari & Ors. v. Madan
        Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 65 and Rajesh & Ors. v. Rajbir
        Singh & Ors., (2013) 9 SCC 54 was noticed by the three Judge
        Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Sanjay Verma v.
        Haryana Roadways, (2014) 3 SCC 210 and the three Judge
        Bench preferred to follow the judgment in Reshma Kumar &
        Ors. (supra). In paras 13 to 15 of the report in Sanjay Verma v.
        Haryana Roadways, (2014) 3 SCC 210, the three Judge Bench
        of the Supreme Court held as under:-
                   13. The view taken in Santosh Devi [(2012) 6 SCC
                   has been reiterated by a Bench of three Judges
                   in Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh [(2013) 9 SCC 54 by
                   holding as follows: (Rajesh case (2013) 9 SCC 54
                   SCC p. 61, paras 8-9)
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                 Page 15 of 19

                   “8. Since the Court in Santosh Devi case [(2012) 6
                   SCC 421 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 726 : (2012) 3 SCC
                   (Cri) 160 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 167] actually
                   intended to follow the principle in the case of
                   salaried persons as laid down in Sarla Verma
                   case [Sarla Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121 :
                   (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 770 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri)
                   1002] and to make it applicable also to the self-
                   employed and persons on fixed wages, it is
                   clarified that the increase in the case of those
                   groups is not 30% always; it will also have a
                   reference to the age. In other words, in the case of
                   self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case,
                   the deceased victim was below 40 years, there
                   must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of
                   the deceased while computing future prospects.
                   Needless to say that the actual income should be
                   income after paying the tax, if any. Addition should
                   be 30% in case the deceased was in the age group
                   of 40 to 50 years.
                   9. In Sarla Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121, it
                   has been stated that in the case of those above 50
                   years, there shall be no addition. Having regard to
                   the fact that in the case of those self-employed or
                   on fixed wages, where there is normally no age of
                   superannuation, we are of the view that it will only
                   be just and equitable to provide an addition of
                   15% in the case where the victim is between the
                   age group of 50 to 60 years so as to make the
                   compensation just, equitable, fair and reasonable.
                   There shall normally be no addition thereafter.”
                   14. Certain parallel developments will now have to
                   be taken note of. In Reshma Kumari v. Madan
                   Mohan (2009) 13 SCC 422, a two-Judge Bench of
                   this Court while considering the following
MAC. APP. 921/2013                                                    Page 16 of 19

                   questions took the view that the issue(s) needed
                   resolution by a larger Bench: (SCC p. 425, para
                   10)
                   “(1) Whether the multiplier specified in the Second
                   Schedule appended to the Act should be
                   scrupulously applied in all the cases?
                   (2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand,
                   the Act provides for any criterion, particularly as
                   regards determination of future prospects?”
                   15. Answering the above reference a three-Judge
                   Bench of this Court in Reshma Kumari v. Madan
                   Mohan (2013) 9 SCC 65 (SCC p. 88, para 36)
                   reiterated the view taken in Sarla Verma [Sarla
                   Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121 to the effect that
                   in respect of a person who was on a fixed salary
                   without provision for annual increments or who
                   was self-employed the actual income at the time of
                   death should be taken into account for determining
                   the loss of income unless there are extraordinary
                   and exceptional circumstances. Though the
                   expression “exceptional and extraordinary
                   circumstances” is not capable of any precise
                   definition, in Shakti Devi v. New India Insurance
                   Co. Ltd. (2010) 14 SCC 575 there is a practical
                   application of the aforesaid principle. The near
                   certainty of the regular employment of the
                   deceased in a government department following
                   the retirement of his father was held to be a valid
                   ground to compute the loss of income by taking
                   into account the possible future earnings. The said
                   loss of income, accordingly, was quantified at
                   double the amount that the deceased was earning
                   at the time of his death.”

9.      Thus, there cannot be any manner of doubt that in the absence
        of any evidence with regard to good future prospects, addition
        of 50% or 30%, as the case may be, is not permissible.
10.     Since there was no evidence of future prospects, addition of
