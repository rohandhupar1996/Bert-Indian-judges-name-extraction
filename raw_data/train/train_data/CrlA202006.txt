                             IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
(THE HIGH COURT OF ASSAM: NAGALAND: MIZORAM & ARUNACHAL PRADESH)
                      Criminal Appeal No. 20 of 2006
                              Sri Haren Barman,
                              S/o Sri Prabhat Barman,
                              Village:-Puradia, Police Station: Bijni,
                              District:-Bongaigaon.
                                                               ----- Accused/Appellant

                              State of Assam.
                                                               ----- Respondent.
                                               BEFORE
                 Hon’ble Mr. Justice Hitesh Kumar Sarma
                   Advocate for the appellant         : None appears.
                   Advocate for Respondent            : Mr. NJ Dutta, Addl. P.P.
                    Date of hearing                ::    11th of July, 2017.
                    Date of Judgment & Order ::          11th of July, 2017.
                                JUDGMENT & ORDER (oral)
                              None appears for the accused/appellant on call. The
        learned Amicus Curiae is not present. Mr. NJ Dutta, learned Additional
        Public Prosecutor, appears for the State of Assam.
        [2]                   In view of the order to be passed, this Court proposes to
        proceed in the absence of the learned Amicus Curiae and without
        hearing her.
        [3]                   This is an appeal under Section 374 of the Cr.PC against
        the judgment and order dated 29.11.2005, passed by the learned Ad-
        Crl. A. No. 20 of 2006                                                     Page 1 of 5

hoc        Additional       Sessions   Judge, Bongaigaon  convicting       the
accused/appellant, Sri Haren Barman in Sessions Case No. 23(B)/2004,
to suffer Rigorous Imprisonment for 3 (three) years and to pay a fine of
Rs, 2,000/-, in default of payment of fine, to undergo Rigorous
Imprisonment for 1 (one) month under Section 326 of the IPC. The
accused/appellant was also convicted and sentenced to further Rigorous
Imprisonment for 3 (three) years and with a fine of Rs. 2,000/- and in
default of payment of fine, to suffer Rigorous Imprisonment for 1 (one)
month under Section 307 of the IPC. The learned Trial Court ordered to
run the sentences concurrently.
[4]                   I have perused the memorandum of appeal. Although in
the memorandum of appeal, no plea has been taken as regard the
juvenility of the accused/appellant, yet the School certificate of the
accused/appellant issued by the Balamguri Provincialised High School on
16.05.2000, which is available in the record, shows that the date of
birth of the accused/appellant is 08.10.1985. Record shows that the date
of occurrence in the instant case is 06.05.2000. That being so, the
accused/appellant, prima facie, subject to final enquiry, appears to be
below 18 years of age on the date of occurrence. I have perused the
impugned judgment. There is no instance in the judgment impugned in
this appeal to show that the plea of juvenility was taken by the
accused/appellant before the learned Trial Court. As stated above, the
plea of juvenility has even not been taken in this appeal. But, the fact
remains that the School certificate, available in the record, as aforesaid,
makes it, prima facie, appear that the accused/appellant was a juvenile
at the relevant time of the occurrence. However, this prima facie view is
subject to an enquiry to be made by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Bongaigaon under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (as amended from time to time).

[5]                   It is important to note here that in the original GR Case
No. 82/2000, out of which the Session Case No. 23(B)/2004 arose,
vide order dated 17.05.2000, the accused/appellant was held to be
below 16 years of age on the basis of the School certificate and
horoscope. The bail was also granted on the ground of his being a
minor.
[6]                   It is apparent from the order dated 17.05.2000 in GR
Case No. 82/2000, the learned Magistrate found the accused/appellant
to be a juvenile, and therefore, granted bail. Even if the plea of
juvenility as aforesaid, has not been taken either in the appeal or before
the Trial court by the accused/appellant yet, in the considered view of
this Court, the Court cannot ignore the School certificate available in the
record on the basis of which bail was granted as well as his age on the
date of recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.PC so as to assess
the juvenility or otherwise of the accused/appellant. That being so, this
Court has taken notice of the fact and has given the direction as
indicated at paragraph 4 of this judgment and order.
[7]                   In the instant case, it appears that the learned Trial Court
completely over-looked the age of the accused/appellant at the time of
commission of the offence. While recording the statement of the
accused/appellant under Section 313 Cr.PC, the learned Trial court
recorded his age as 23 years on 27.10.2005. The occurrence took place
evidently on 06.05.2000. Therefore, on the date of occurrence, the
accused/appellant was below 18 years of age, and prima facie, a
juvenile. So, the Trial Court ought to have taken into consideration the
age of the accused/appellant which he failed to do.

[8]                   The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Dharambir Vs.
State (NCT of Delhi), reported in the case of (2010) 5 SCC 344, in
paragraph 14 has held as follows:-
“14. Proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 7-A contemplates that a claim
of juvenility can be raised before any Court and has to be recognised at
any stage even after disposal of the case and such claim is required to be
determined in terms of the provisions contained in the Act of 2000 and
the Rules framed thereunder, even if the Juvenile has ceased to be so on
or before the date of the commencement of the Act of 2000. The effect
of the proviso is that a Juvenile who had not completed eighteen years
of age on the date of commission of the offence would also be entitled
to the benefit of the Act of 2000 as if the provisions of Section 2(k) of
the said Act, which defines “juvenile” or “child” to mean a person who
has not completed eighteenth year of age, had always been in existence
even during the operation of the 1986 Act.”
[9]                   A Division Bench of this Court in the case of Bulu Ali Vs.
State of Assam, reported in 2011 (3) GLT 78, has also held that the issue
of juvenility can be raised at any time.
[10]                  It also appears from the record of the Sessions Case that
the confessional statement of the accused/appellant was recorded on
10.05.2000 by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate. This
confessional statement was exhibited as Ext. 6 in the Trial Court of the
learned Sessions Judge. On perusal of the confessional statement,
recorded vide Ext.6, it appears that age of the accused/appellant has not
been recorded, which was necessary to be ascertained at that point of
time as well as during the trial of the case.
[11]                  In view of the above position, this criminal appeal is
disposed of with a direction to the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Crl. A. No. 20 of 2006                                              Page 4 of 5

Bongaigaon to make an enquiry as regards the juvenility of the
accused/appellant, Sri Haren Barman at the time of occurrence and to
proceed in accordance with the findings of such enquiry. However, it is
made clear that if the Additional Sessions Judge, Bongaigaon is not
available, the Sessions Judge, Bongaigaon would take up the case and
will dispose of the same in compliance with the directions given above.
[12]                  Send down the LCR along with a copy of this order to the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bongaigaon for proceeding with the
case, as directed above. Accordingly, the appeal is remanded to the Trial
Court.
[13]                  This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
                                                                      JUDGE
