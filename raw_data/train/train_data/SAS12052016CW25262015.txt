1.      This writ petition pertains to the assessment year 2007-08 and
seeks quashing of notice dated 27.03.2014 issued by respondent under
Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as
the said ‘Act’) and the consequent proceedings thereto including the
order dated 23.02.2015 dismissing the objections filed by the

WP(C)No.2526/2015                                                        Page 1 of 16

2.     The main challenge raised in the writ petition is that the re-
assessment proceedings have been initiated after a period of 4 (four)
years from the end of the relevant assessment year and the pre-
condition for such initiation that there was failure on the part of the
assessee to fully and truly disclose all the material particulars
necessary for the assessment is absent. It is contended that there was
true and full disclosure of all material particulars made by the assessee
and the reasons for re-opening do not even show that there was any
such failure on the part of the assessee. It is further contended that it is
a clear case of change of opinion, in as much as, the issue sought to be
raked up by way of the impugned notice under Section 148 of the Act
had been duly considered by the Assessing Officer during the original
assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act.
3.     The original assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act was
completed on 07.10.2009. The return of income was filed on
16.11.2007. On 15.07.2009 a detailed questionnaire was issued by the
Assessing Officer during the original proceedings under Section
143(3) of the Act raising specific queries with regard to share
application money. The specific query raised by the questionnaire
dated 15.07.2009 pertaining to the share application money is as
under:-
       “B.1 For share capital, loans other than banks and inter
       corporate deposits, introduced/taken during the year and

       Same information may please be given in respect of
       squared up loans if any during the year.
       Please give a detailed note with regard to advance from

8.     In CIT vs. Usha International Ltd. (2012)         348 ITR 485
(Delhi) (FB), a full bench of this Court held:-
       “Re-assessment proceedings will be invalid in case an
       issue or query is raised and answered by the assessee in
       original assessment proceedings but thereafter the
       Assessing Officer does not make any addition in the
       assessment order. In such situations it should be
       accepted that the issue was examined but the Assessing
       Officer did not find any ground or reason to make
       addition or reject the stand of the assessee. He forms an
       opinion. The re-assessment will be invalid because the
       Assessing Officer had formed an opinion in the original
       assessment, though he had not recorded his reasons.”
9.     On 27.03.2014, the impugned notice under Section 148 of the
Act has been issued. The reasons supplied to the assessee for re-
opening of the case dated 24.03.2014 record as under:-

         The DDIT (Inv.) has further submitted that the investors
         have been verified from ITD and none of them reflect
         receipt of nay dividend on the investment made by them.
         The returns declaring meagre income/nil/loss income
         create suspicion on the creditworthiness of the investors.
                 “it is evidently clear that the undisclosed income
                 of these beneficiary companies which has been
                 introduced by them in the form of share capital
                 /premium/loan has escaped taxation. Therefore it
                 is requested that there amounts be brought to tax
                 by initiating action under section 148 of the
                 Income Tax Act, 1961 for the A.Y. 2007-08 in the
                 case of above mentioned beneficiary companies.”
         Since the creditworthiness and genuineness of the above
         investors remained unverified I therefore reason to
         believe that an income to the extent of Rs. 3,00,00,000/-
WP(C)No.2526/2015                                                    Page 12 of 16

       has escaped assessment and to assessee the income
       mentioned         above       and      to     verify     the
       genuineness/creditworthiness of the above investors. I
       propose to issue notice u/s 148 of the Income Tax Act,
       1961 for the assessment year 2007-08.
       Therefore, I have reason to believe that THE ASSESSEE
       COMPANY M/s Allied Strips Limited has concealed the
       particulars of income to the extent of Rs. 3,00,00,000/-
       which has not been disclosed in its return of income for
       the assessment year 2007-08. In view of this, I am
       satisfied that it is a fit case for reopening u/s 148 as the
       case of the assessee is fully covered as per the provisions
       of the I.T. Act, 1961 Section 147.”
10.    It is clear from the above, that the present case is one of change
of opinion. The questionnaire and particularly question B.1
specifically raise the issue with regard to share capital. It requires the
petitioner to give a list, source, genuineness, identity of the share
holders along with confirmation copies of the ledger account of the
party including confirmation of the mode, date, address and
acknowledgement of return, etc. from the said party along with source
and relevant bank entries. The said information was provided by the
assessee. After receipt of the said information, Assessing Officer did
not think it fit to make an addition and, under these circumstances, no
addition itself amounts to forming an opinion as has been held in
Usha International Ltd. (supra).
WP(C)No.2526/2015                                                Page 13 of 16

11.    Therefore, in our view, the present exercise of issuing the notice
under Section 148 of the Act would amount to nothing but a change of
opinion, which is not permissible.
12.    Another reason why the impugned notice under Section 148
and the proceedings consequent thereto have to be set aside is that the
pre-condition of there being a failure on part of the assessee to fully
and truly disclose all the material particulars necessary for assessment
has not been made out.
13.    Perusal of the reasons for initiating re-assessment shows that
there is not even an allegation that there has been failure on the part of
the petitioner/assessee to fully and truly disclose all the material
particulars necessary for re-assessment.
14.    In Haryana Acrylic Manufacturing P. Ltd. Co. Vs. CIT 2009
(308) ITR 38 (Delhi), this Court held as under:-
       “29. In the reasons supplied to the petitioner, there is
       no whisper, what to speak of any allegation, that the
       petitioner had failed to disclose fully and truly all
       material facts necessary for assessment and that because
       of this failure there has been an escapement of income
       chargeable to tax. Merely having a reason to believe that
       income had escaped assessment is not sufficient to
       reopen assessments beyond the four year period
       indicated above. The escapement of income from
       assessment must also be occasioned by the failure on the
WP(C)No.2526/2015                                                Page 14 of 16

       part of the assessee to disclose material facts, fully and
       truly. This is a necessary condition for overcoming the
       bar set up by the proviso to section 147. If this condition
       is not satisfied, the bar would operate and no action
       under section 147 could be taken. We have already
       mentioned above that the reasons supplied to the
       petitioner does not contain any such allegation.
       Consequently, one of the conditions precedent for
       removing the bar against taking action after the said four
       year period remains unfulfilled. In our recent decision in
       Wel Intertrade Private Ltd. [2009] 308 ITR 22 (Delhi)
       we had agreed with the view taken by the Punjab and
       Haryana High Court in the case of Duli Chand
       Singhania [2004] 269 ITR 192 that, in the absence of an
       allegation in the reasons recorded that the escapement of
       income had occurred by reason of failure on the part of
       the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts
       necessary for his assessment, any action taken by the
       Assessing Officer under section 147 beyond the four year
       period would be wholly without jurisdiction. Reiterating
       our view-point, we hold that the notice dated March 29,
       2004, under section 148 based on the recorded reasons
       as supplied to the petitioner as well as the consequent
       order dated March 2, 2005, are without jurisdiction as
       no action under section 147 could be taken beyond the
       four year period in the circumstances narrated above.”
15.    In the present case also, there is not even a whisper of any
allegation that there has been a failure on the part of the assessee to
disclose fully and truly all material particulars necessary for
assessment.

16.    Thus the petition is liable to succeed. The writ petition is
allowed and the impugned notice under Section 148 of the Act dated
27.03.2014 and all proceedings consequent thereto including the order
dated 23.02.2015 are quashed /set aside. There shall be no order as to
costs.
