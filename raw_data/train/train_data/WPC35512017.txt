        HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
          HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN
20.6.2017
(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
       Mr.HK Das, learned counsel for the petitioners.
       None for the respondents.
       Heard on admission.
       This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution is
directed against the order dated 24.5.2012 passed by the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, whereby it has allowed
respondent’s O.A. No.144/2012.
2.     The    case   of  respondent     for  promotion   to   Senior
Administrative Grade was rejected as he was found unfit for
promotion on account of low grading/adverse remarks. Aggrieved,
the respondent filed O.A. No.144/2012 before the Tribunal and
stated that the low grading/adverse remarks were in fact
upgraded by the competent authority. The Tribunal, after hearing
the respondent and the petitioners, held that the adverse remarks
of the respondent were upgraded and un-communicated adverse
remarks could not have been taken into consideration. The
Tribunal, therefore, directed the petitioners to reconsider the case
of respondent within two months.
3.     Admittedly, a similar decision of the Tribunal in respect of
another officer was challenged by the petitioners in WP(C)
No.4130/2012 and the same was dismissed by a Division Bench of
this Court vide order dated 23.02.2015. Thereafter, the petitioners
filed Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3566/2017 and it too was
dismissed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 20.2.2017. We,
                                                          Page 1 of 2

therefore, dismiss the present writ petition also in the light of
order dated 23.02.2015 passed by the Division Bench in WP(C)
No.4130/2012.
          JUDGE                               CHIEF JUSTICE
