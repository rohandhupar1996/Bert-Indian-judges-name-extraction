                         JUDGMENT
1.    The Commissioner of Sales Tax (hereinafter referred to as
the 'Department' for the sake of brevity) has filed CWP
No.18054/2004 under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of
India challenging the Orders dated 13.5.2004, 1.10.2004 and
14.10.2004 passed by the Appellate Tribunal, Sales Tax in which
the Department had been directed to issue statutory Declaration
Forms to the Respondent Jagannath Dudadhar. The Appellate
Tribunal, Sales Tax, had also declined the Department's request
to stay the operation of its Order during the pendency of the
Reference under Section 45 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 (DST
Act for short). This Court has, time and again, disapproved the
impleadment of Tribunals or any other Authority functioning in a
judicial or quasi judicial capacity. Accordingly, we have suo moto
struck off the Appellate Tribunal, Sales Tax, New Delhi from the
array of Parties.
2.    On 7.8.2003 Dudadhar applied for issuance of statutory
Declaration Forms for the Assessment Years (AYs) 2001-2002 and
2002-2003 under the DST Act and Central Sales Tax Act, 1956
('CST Act' for short) aggregating Rs.67,73,26,240/- stated to be
CWP 18054/2004                                         page 2 of 41

involving a sales tax revenue of over Rs.13.3 crores. On 9.9.2003
the Sales Tax Officer (STO) issued a Deficiency Memo predicated
on various demands remaining outstanding against Dudahdar in
respect of the AYs 1989-1990 to 1993-1994, 1998-1999, 2000-
2001 and 2001-2002 and for the wrong utilisation of Declaration
Forms    already   supplied  to  it. The   Department    proposed
furnishing of additional surety and for withholding issuance of
Declaration Forms under the provisions of Rule 8(4)(c)(ii) of the
DST    Rules,   1975.  On   17.10.2003   the   STO   rejected   the
applications   of  Dudadhar     for  issuance   of  the   statutory
Declaration Forms. On 23.1.2004 Dudadhar filed Appeals
against the said Orders dated 17.10.2003. On 6.4.2004 the
Assistant Commissioner (Appeals) - VII, Sales Tax, dismissed
these Appeals and confirmed the Order of the STO observing
inter alia that Dudadhar had made claims of sales to registered
dealers who were either found not to be functional or to be non-
existent; and because the majority of the claims for exemption
were found not to be genuine. On 15.4.2004 this Order was
assailed before the Appellate Tribunal, Sales Tax and these
Appeals were accepted on 13.5.2004. The Tribunal, inter alia,
held that the surety provisions applicable to the proper use and
custody of ST-I could not be applied to the grant or refusal of ST-
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 3 of 41

35 and ST-35/1 Forms in the absence of specific provision under
Section 18 of the DST Act. Rectification/Review application under
Section 48 of the DST Act was filed by the Department which was
rejected by Orders dated 26.5.2004. After the filing of and the
subsequent withdrawal of WP(C) No.9879/2004 a Reference
under Section 45 of the DST Act was initiated by the Department
on 5.6.2004. On 5.8.2004 another application for Rectification
under Section 48 of the DST Act of the Order dated 13.5.2004
was initiated which came to be dismissed by Orders dated
20.8.2004. It appears that four questions are awaiting final
adjudication by this Court in the pending Reference. On
6.10.2004 the Appellate Tribunal disposed of the Department's
application for stay of the operation of the Order dated 13.5.2004
by requiring Dudadhar to furnish Securities amounting to
Rs.60,00,000/- in the form of Bank Guarantees. A week later, on
14.10.2004, the preceding Order dated 6.10.2004 stipulating
security in the form of Bank Guarantees was modified to require
the furnishing of a Surety instead, even in the face of the
Department's vehement opposition. It is in these circumstances
that WP(C) No.18054/2004 has been initiated.
CWP 18054/2004                                         page 4 of 41

3.     CWP No.11487/2005 has been filed by Dudadhar invoking
Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India for mandating the
Respondents to rectify two Declaration Forms in ST-35/1 or issue
fresh Declarations in lieu thereof in conformity with the
provisions of the DST Act and the Rules framed thereunder. As
already adumbrated, on 10.9.2001, the Petitioner had applied to
the Department for the supply of five Declaration ST-35/1 Forms
to be issued to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL).
Consequent upon its request being turned down Dudadhar filed
CWP No.6976/2001 which was disposed of by Orders dated
21.11.2001. The concerned STO had submitted to the Court that
a fresh speaking Order would be passed. On 22.12.2001 the STO
called upon Dudadhar to furnish a surety for Rs.50,00,000/- and
Rs.10,00,000/- under the Local and Central Acts respectively,
which were duly furnished. While on this aspect of the dispute it
may be mentioned, as submitted by Mr. Aurora, learned counsel
for the Department, that a surety produced by Dudahdar came
to be withdrawn because the surety/Jainsons had stated that its
signatures on the Deed had been forged. This event should not be
lost sight of since the interests of the State in collection of sales
tax should not be put to peril. Thereupon, on 24.12.2001, the STO
issued   five   Declaration  Forms     in ST-35/1    in  respect   of
CWP 18054/2004                                          page 5 of 41

transactions with BPCL but specifically restricting their user to
AY 2001-02. Three of these Declaration Forms were issued to
BPCL for supplies made during 2001-2002 and the remaining two
Declaration Forms were issued to BPCL for supplies made during
2002-2003. On 29.3.2004 the STO rejected the two Declaration
Forms while framing the assessment of BPCL for the AY 2002-
2003 and created Sales Tax demands against BPCL for these
transactions. It is undisputed that recovery of the sales tax from
BPCL has been effected. BPCL had filed an Appeal against this
assessment, in the course of which it had been directed to make a
pre-deposit, which Orders had been assailed by BPCL by means
of another writ petition. It was in these circumstances that
Dudadhar had requested the STO to rectify or validate the two
Declaration Forms unauthorisedly used by it during 2002-2003.
This request having not been acceded to by the STO has
occasioned the filing of CWP No.11487/2005. It is admitted that
Dudadhar had unilaterally scored out the 'AY 2001-2002' and
instead written 'AY 2002-2003' on two of the five Declaration
Forms supplied to it. The Department has also made a grievance
of the fact that Dudadhar attempted to illegally use these two
Declaration Forms ST-35/1 as ST-35 Forms.

4.     In   Prince    Plastics   &     Chemical    Industries   -vs-
Commissioner of Sales Tax, [2003] 131 STR 372 and S.N.E.
(India) Pvt. Ltd. -vs- Commissioner of Sales Tax, [2003] 131 STR
417 another Division Bench had the occasion to cogitate upon the
various aspects of ST-1 Declaration Forms, from the standpoint of
selling dealers and also purchasing dealers. In Prince Plastics
the registered dealers had sold goods without charging sales tax
allegedly on the false assurance that Declaration Forms would be
furnished. It was contended by those Petitioners that predicated
purely on their status as registered dealers, they were entitled to
exemption from payment of sales tax and that, therefore, Rule 8
(4)(c) of the DST Rules was ultra vires the DST Act. The Division
Bench underscored that the charging section of the DST Act does
not prohibit either multiple taxation or multi-point taxation, but
on the contrary envisages it; that the intent behind the devising of
the “C” Forms or “ST-1” Forms is to avoid multi-point taxation;
that Declaration Forms enable a dealer to pass on the burden of
sales tax in such a fashion that it ultimately reaches the buyer-
consumer; that none of the provisions of the Act postulate that all
sales to registered dealers per se qualify for deductions; that the
penultimate of the three provisos to Section 4(2)(a) of the DST
Act declares that no deduction in respect of any sale referred to
CWP 18054/2004                                         page 7 of 41

in sub-section(v) shall be allowed unless a true declaration in the
prescribed form duly filled and signed by the dealer is furnished;
that there is no foundation for the argument that the selling
dealer cannot charge sales tax where the purchasing dealer does
not   simultaneously   furnish  ST-1   forms;   that even     if  the
purchasing dealer has applied for ST-1 forms but has not
received them for any reason, the selling dealer is not
automatically exonerated from the statutory duty to collect sales
tax; that it is not uncommon for dealers to renege on their
commitment to supply ST-1 forms or for the Department to
decline to supply these forms to them because of their falling in
arrears of payment of tax; that the State does not forfeit its rights
and entitlement to collect sales tax; that the dealer who has
mistakenly chosen to trust another dealer for supply of
Declaration Forms must suffer for his mercantile recklessness;
that selling dealers have the remedy of filing suits against the
purchasing dealers for the recovery of money, i.e. the sales tax
component which has to be paid to the State by it because of the
failure or inability or plain refusal of the purchasing dealer to
forward the requisite Declaration Forms. Rule 8(4)(c) of the DST
Rules was held to be intra vires Section 4(2)(a)(v) of the DST Act.

5.    In Prince Plastics the Division Bench had by means of the
common Judgments decided writ petitions filed by other dealers
including Messrs Simran Engineering Works, Messrs Swastik
Industrial Power Lines and Messrs National Products, who
thereafter filed Appeals before the Supreme Court numbered as
Appeal Civil 314/2003, 315/2003 and 308/2003 respectively.
S.N.E. (India) Pvt. Ltd. similarly also assailed the Division
Bench Judgment against it by filing a Special Leave Petition
bearing No.313 of 2003. Meanwhile, the Department, on the
other hand had already filed Appeals Civil 1717-1719/1999
against the Division Bench Judgment dated November 30, 1998
reported as Shri Krishna Engg. Co. -vs- Commissioner of Sales
Tax, Delhi, [2003] 131 STC 321, which according to counsel had
preferred a different view. All these Appeals came to be decided
by the Apex Court as Commissioner of Sales Tax, Delhi -vs- Shri
Krishna Engg. Co., AIR 2005 SC 958. We have laboured to give
these details since it is not readily forthcoming and obvious from
the Judgment of their Lordship that the enunciation of the law
made by the Division Bench of this Court in Prince Plastics and
S.N.E. (India) Pvt. Ltd. had been affirmed, and that expressed
by the Division Bench of this Court in Shri Krishna Engg. Co.
came to be rejected.
CWP 18054/2004                                         page 9 of 41

6.    In Shri Krishna the Supreme Court upheld the ratio of
Prince Plastics (which also decided Simran Engineering Works)
in these words:-
         38. It is the contention of the selling/purchasing
         dealers that selling dealers are made to suffer the
         consequences of failures and defaults on the part of
         the purchasing dealers in which they have played no
         part whatsoever, they are in hapless position and
         would be compelled to incur Sales Tax liability for
         events which are not within their control and that Rule
         8(4)(c) travels beyond the ambit of Section 4(2)(a)(v)
         of the Act. A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court,
         by their judgment dated 12-7-2002, which is impugned
         in these civil appeals dismissed the challenge in
         regard to the vires of Rule 8(4)(c).
         39. We have carefully gone through the judgment of
         the Division Bench in Simran Engineering Works etc.
         The reasoning given by the Bench in rejecting the
         challenge in regard to the vires of Rule 8(4)(c) are
         very sound.    As rightly pointed out by the Division
         Bench, the Sales Tax Department is neither privy to
         nor is it concerned with any assurances that might
         have been exchanged inter se between the selling and
         purchasing dealers in the matter of furnishing ST-1
         Forms. There is no reason for the consequences of the
         dealers acts of omission or commission to visit the
         Department. The Act and the Rules do not prohibit the
         simultaneous furnishing of ST-1 Forms, they, in fact,
CWP 18054/2004                                       page 10 of 41

      envisage it.  Supply of ST-1 Forms by the Department
      under the Rules is an advance, however, the actual
      practice may be different (para 7 onwards of page 36
      of the judgment).
      40. In our opinion, the generality of the provision of
      Section 71(1) should be given its full effect so as to
      enable the making of Rules for the full implementation
      of any provisions of the Act. The impugned rule also
      gives effect to Section 43(5) of the Act which deals
      with appeals and contains the requirement of pre-
      deposit of tax and penalty. Other situations where the
      Commissioner has the discretion to cancel the dealers
      registration for failure to pay tax including penalty,
      furnishing a false declaration etc. which must be borne
      in mind while considering the sweep of Section 71(1)
      of the Act. Thus, the primary intendment of the Act is
      to levy and collect tax and every devise, including of
      stipulations   pertaining    to  the    dealer  friendly
      declaration Forms are incorporated to implement the
      objective of the Act itself as pointed out by the High
      Court they cannot be conceived as ultra vires the
      statute (pages 63-64 of the judgment).
      ......
      42. We are of the opinion that the judgment and order
      of the High Court in Shri Krishna Engineering Co. case
      (CWP 3304 of 1997) is passed on a misconstruction of
      the clear statutory provisions contained in Sections 4,
      71(1), 71(2)(b) and (s) of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975
      and that the High Court has also not appreciated the
CWP 18054/2004                                     page 11 of 41

         true scope of the rule-making power which has been
         conferred on the Lt. Governor of Delhi by Section 71
         (1) of the Act which lays down that the administrator
         may make rules for carrying out the purposes of the
         Act. A general power has thus been conferred upon
         the administrator to make appropriate rules to carry
         out the purposes of the Act. The purpose of the Act is
         not just to fix liability but also to recover the liabilities
         which are so fixed. The High Court also has not
         noticed that Section 71(2)(s) of the Act which confers
         a residual power on the administrator to makes rules
         in respect of any other matter which is required to be
         or may be prescribed. We are, therefore, of the
         opinion that the impugned amendment was within the
         rule-making power of the Lt. Governor of Delhi under
         Section 71(2)(b) read in conjunction and harmoniously
         with Section 71(2)(s).
7.    We should also briefly notice the decision of the Division
Bench of the Patna High Court in I.T.C. Limited -vs- State of
Bihar, [2004] 137 STC 15 which was pronounced one year prior
to the authoritative Shri Krishna Judgment of the Supreme
Court. The Bihar Finance Act, 1981 provided for the levy of tax
on the sale and purchase of goods in Bihar. The Bench observed
that any provision either under the Act or the Rules calculated to
prevent evasion of tax on intra-state sales would be within the
CWP 18054/2004                                           page 12 of 41

power of the State Legislature, which could not, however, make
any law with regard to inter-state sale or commerce or in the
course of export. The Bench thereafter noted that the purpose
behind carrying a Declaration Form is for verification and
assessment of tax payable as well as for the prevention of evasion
of tax. However, applying the ratio of State of Bihar -vs- Harihar
Prasad Debuka, [1989] 73 STC 353 : (1989) 2 SCC 192 it was
held   that   Declaration  Forms    do   not   prohibit  inter-state
transportation   of  goods   but   differentiate  and   distinguish
unauthorised trade or business to which freedom of trade and
commerce would not apply. Such Declaration Forms would not
affect the freedom of movement of goods throughout the country.
On the contrary it would promote such movement as it would
have the effect of distinguishing goods that would be transported
across the territory of the State from those which would reach
the consumption point within the State. The other point that was
decided by the Division Bench was that insistence on payment of
admitted dues for grant of Declaration Forms can be justified on
the ground that the authorities may decline their issuance
wherever admitted dues had not been deposited. However,
refusal to issue Declaration Forms predicated on the non-deposit
of disputed amount would be unjustified. In this context it should
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 13 of 41

be recalled that in Dawar Brothers -vs- State of Madhya Pradesh,
[1979] 44 STC 286 the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh
High Court had opined that the rule-making powers of the State
Government under Section 13 (3) and (4) of the Central Act
cannot be employed by it as a device for the realisation of its own
dues under the State Act. Reliance had been placed on Khemka
& Co.(Agencies) Pvt. Ltd. -vs- State of Maharashtra, [1975] 35
STC 571: AIR 1975 SC 1549 where it was held that dues under
the Central Act should be differentiated from those arising out of
the State Act and that the powers and penalties contained in the
Central Act cannot be extrapolated into the State Acts. The
essence of all these Judgments, therefore, is that the objective of
a State statute should ordinarily not extend to the recovery of
dues under a Central Act.
8.    However, the Division Bench of this Court in Gupta Trading
Co. -vs- Delhi Administration, [1986] 62 STC 7 had clarified that
sales ought not to be looked at in isolation as they were an
integral part of the overall business activity of the dealer; that the
clandestine disposal of goods to the detriment of sales tax
collection could not be overlooked and preventive steps to
preserve the Department's interests could be adopted.          It was
CWP 18054/2004                                          page 14 of 41

held that “Rule 8(4)(c) also permits the assessing authority to
withhold the issue of ST-1 form for reasons to be recorded in
writing, in case default in furnishing any return together with
documents, etc. Discovery of adverse material suggesting any
concealment of sale or purchase or furnishing inadequate
particulars in the return may also result in disentitlement of such
forms”. We prefer this analysis of law since laxity in approach
inexorably enables the retention by the dealer of sales tax that
has already been collected from the ultimate customer or
consumer.
9.    Mr. Randhir Chawla, learned counsel for Dudadhar has
not brought to our notice any decision to the effect that if a
dealer is in arrears of tax or defaults in depositing the admitted
tax dues so far as the State statute is concerned, the Department
must nevertheless issue Declaration Forms pertaining to inter-
state transactions. Having given careful consideration to the
issue we are not persuaded to hold that even though a dealer is in
default of payments of sales tax dues, the Department must issue
Declaration Forms in respect of inter-state sales transactions. It
seems to us that issuance of a Mandamus in these circumstances
would be wholly inappropriate and a Writ Court would be fully
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 15 of 41

justified in declining to give succour to the defaulting party or to
another party which has been reckless or sanguine in going
through transactions without insisting that Declaration Forms be
furnished to it or exemplifies recalcitrance in depositing State
dues.
10.    In the backdrop of this legal analysis we shall now take up
in detail the facts of the present case. Mr. Randhir Chawla,
learned counsel for Dudadhar contends that the present dispute
has already attracted the attention of this Court, yet the
Department devises one stratagem or another to deny actual and
consequential relief to it. Dudadhar had filed CW 2107/1997
which was allowed by the Division Bench vide Orders dated
28.5.1997,    noticing,  inter  alia, that  the   Department    had
incorrectly taken into account dues of Rs.29,58,446/- in respect of
AY 1986-1987 although this amount had been stayed and
therefore there was no justification for the refusal to issue
Declaration Forms. Our attention has thereafter been drawn to
the Orders dated 21-11-2001 by which this Court had disposed of
Dudadhar's writ petition CW 6976/2001. The STO was present in
Court at that hearing and had undertaken to pass a fresh order
after hearing the Petitioners. Pursuant to this undertaking the
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 16 of 41

following Orders dated 22.12.2001 were passed, which according
to Mr. Chawla finally and firmly settle the issues between the
parties,   operating, as it must, as res judicata. Therefore, he
contends that upto the AY 2001-2002 the Department cannot
require furnishing of any surety beyond Rs. 50 lacs under the
DST Act and Rs.10 Lacs under the CST Act. The Order reads

     undersigned to pass speaking order in this case.
     Without prejudice of anything the status of the case is as
     under:
     The dealer was assessed for the year 1997-98 creating a
     demand      of  Rs.65845299/-    under     Local       Act    and
     Rs.2919304 under Central Act. The demand was raised
     due to the rejection of the sale version of the dealer
     under the Local Act as well as under the Central Act.
     The dealer has filed an appeal before the first appellate
     authority    and   went   to   High    Court        vide     CWP
     No.6808/2001 for stay of the demand. The stay was
     granted by the Hon'ble High Court subject to filing of a
     surety of Rs.60 lacs and a cash deposit of Rs.12 lacs.
     The dealer has sent C portion of bank challan of this
     amount and filed surety of Rs.60 lacs for confirmation.
     The dealer was assessed for 1998-99 creating a demand
     of Rs.171206276/- under Local Act and Rs.867820/-
     under Central Act. The dealer has filed appeal against
     this demand alongwith stay application before the first
     appellate authority and the same is pending with the first
     appellant authority. The basis of the demand created was
     similar to the year 1997-98.
     The dealer has already obtained 21 'C' forms 30 ST1
     forms 128 ST35 forms and 927 ST 35/1 forms for the
     year 1999-2000 involving a purchase of Rs.25-30 crores
     and involving crores of tax on these forms.
      Again dealer obtained 100 ST 35/1/-Rs.220194747
      14 C forms for                        Rs. 57205693

      Total                                Rs.277400440
                                           ---------------------
     For the year 2000-01 involving purchase of 27.74 crores
     and a tax effect of Rs.5-6 crores. The assessment of the
     dealer is being framed by the Enforcement branch of the
     Sales Tax Deptt. The sales conducted by the dealer under
     the local act as well as under the Central act for the year
     1997-98 cross verified by a team of the Enforcement
     branch of the sales tax department. It was found by the
     team that the purchasing dealers to whom the sales was
     shown were not in existence and their R/c's cancelled
     and the 90% of the sales shown to these regd. dealers
     was not genuine. The firm Jagannath Dudadhar obtained
     advance ST 35/1 forms from the deptt. and show his 90%
     sales to such dealers on forms ST 35 and the govt. losses
     revenue on these forms issued to the dealer in crores.
     Similarly a team of the Enforcement staff was sent to
     cross verify the interstate sale of the dealer for the year
     1997-98 to the various cities of the Rajasthan and it was
     reported by the visiting team that all the dealers were
     not in existence and the forms submitted by the dealers
     already    declared    obsolete   by   the      Commissioner
     commercial tax deptt. Jaipur (Rajasthan) in some case
     even the forms were not issued to those dealers by the
     deptt.
     Dealer was confronted with all these observations and
     his reply was mainly that he is being harassed by the
     department and all the process is being done to withhold
     the issuance of forms to him. He has obtained stay from
CWP 18054/2004                                           page 19 of 41

     the Hon'ble High Court for the year 1997-98. He has
     filed appeal before the first appellate authority alongwith
     stay application for the year 1998-99. All his sale are
     genuine and he is being harassed by the deptt. for
     malafide purpose.
     As regarding the new inserted of the third proviso of
     Delhi Sales Tax Rules vide 8(4) c for obtaining blank
     declaration forms in respect of transactions already
     finalised in the past a dealer is required to submit a
     requisition a/c. in Form ST2A (for local form) and form
     2A for central form alongwith his last return of the
     corresponding assessment year. The dealer has filed his
     requirement for ST 35-9 for different amount for the year
     2000-01. As regarding submission of ST 2B and 2B
     alongwith quarterly returns in case of advance forms the
     same has been submitted at the time of the application
     for issue of forms.
     In his reply the dealer has explained that rejection of
     sale version is no where mentioned in rule 8 which
     governs the issue of forms. It is to be explained that as
     per rule 8(4)c(iii) elaborates a dealer found by an
     appropriate assessing authority having some adverse
     material against him suggesting any concealment of sale
     or purchase or of furnishing inaccurate particulars in the
     returns. Therefore the adverse material is also important
     in issuance of forms i.e. sale should be genuine of the
     dealer to whom forms are to be issued.
     In the light of above observations as the dealer has been
     directed by the Hon'ble High Court to file 60 lacs surety
CWP 18054/2004                                       page 20 of 41

     and 12 lacs cash deposit while granting stay for the year
     1997-98 and the demand of 1998-99 two and half times
     the demand of 1997-98 and the forms for the year 1999-
     2000 and 2000-2001 already received by the dealer. The
     dealer has applied for 5 advance 'C' forms in which he
     can make purchases of crores of Rs. from 5 different
     dealers during the year 2001-02. The dealer has also
     applied for advance 35/1 forms for local purchase. The
     dealer after making the purchases through these forms
     manipulates his sales (90% of which are not genuine)
     and depositing tax on a minor amount of sales.
     In the light of above observation to safeguard the
     government exchequer I hereby direct the dealer to
     file a surety of Rs.50 lacs under the Local Act and
     10 lacs under the Central Act. (highlighting added)
11.  In respect of AY 2002-2003 an Assessment Order was
passed, the salient extract of which reads as follows:
            The     dealer    has   made     purchases     worth
     Rs.22,67,28,668/- from B.P.C. Ltd., the Principal, during
     the year on the strength of ST-35/1 forms in his capacity
     as sole selling agent and has sold these goods in the
     course of local sale barring the tax paid sales for a sum
     of Rs.25.57 crores appx. The dealer has argued that he is
     not liable to pay tax on purchase from BPCL since he has
     not been issued ST-35 or ST-35/1 forms. He has
     therefore argued that these purchases shown against ST-
     35 and ST-35/1 forms may be treated as tax paid
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 21 of 41

    purchases. The dealer plea is not tenable since he has
    filed requisition of these forms on his own and had also
    filed the application for obtaining these forms from the
    ward. The application was however rejected but the
    dealer preferred an appeal against these orders of
    rejection. Furthermore the dealer has not filed any proof
    of payment of tax on these purchases to the seller and
    hence these purchases cannot be taken as tax paid
    purchases.
           The dealer has shown RD sales for a sum of
    Rs.22,74,56,360/-.    These  sales  barring   sales  worth
    Rs.16,59,40,405/- shown made to M/s. Vigyan Udyog
    Corp., 20, G.F., Bagichi Madho Dass, Near Red Fort,
    Delhi LC No./14/073392/0383 were found verified from
    DMI, hence the credit is allowed. As regards sales shown
    made to M/s. Vigyan Udyog Corp., the dealer has
    furnished 34 ST-35 forms none of which contain the
    validity stamp for the year for which these have been
    issued by the ward to the purchasing dealer. Inquiries
    made from ward-14 have revealed that these forms were
    among the last issued forms on 12.04.90. RC's of the firm
    have    been    cancelled   w.e.f. 29.09.03.   There   are
    diversified items allowed to the dealer in his RC's and no
    forms have been issued to him since 12.04.90.
           Sensing the dubious activities of the purchasing
    dealer and connivance between selling and purchasing
    dealers, notices were sent to M/s. Vigyan Udyog Corp. at
    the last available business premises address as well as at
    the available residential address of the proprietor Shri
CWP 18054/2004                                      page 22 of 41

    Madan Lal Sharma. While the notices sent at the
    residential address have been received back from postal
    authority with the remarks STI of the ward has reported
    that the firm was not found functioning at the quoted
    business   premises.   Therefore,   the  transaction  are
    imaginary and not straightforward. The dealer has tried
    to avoid payment of tax by covering such huge
    transaction of local cash sales by statutory forms of non
    functioning firm without authority by the ward officer for
    specific year. Further, the said purchasing firm has not
    filed any return for the assessment year 2002-2003.
    Whatever quarterly returns filed by that dealer during
    1999-2000 to 2001-2002 also shown nil GTO during
    these qtrs. As such, the said purchasing dealer has not
    functioned at least w.e.f. April, 1999. Therefore, these
    transactions shall be taxed @ 20%. The dealer could not
    file ST-35 for Rs.66,42,792/- to be taxed @ 20% under
    the Local Act.
          The assessment of the dealer is framed as under :-
           G.T.O.                  : 88,36,45,045.00
           ISS                     : 14,69,27,862.00

                     @ 20%         : 60,26,96,696.00
                     @ 8%          :     1,25,000.00(Sold

              Tax Assessed           :12,17,76,449.00
              Tax Paid               :   15,34,886.00
              Tax Due                :12,02,41,563.00

              Penalty                :   10,00,000.00
              Total Tax Due          :15,37,04,085.00
            Thus, the dealer is directed to pay a sum of
      Rs.15,37,04,085/- in terms of demand notice enclosed.
Keeping these details in perspective we are not convinced that
the conclusion of the Department that Dudadhar's dealings with
alleged dealers is in consonance with the statute. Prima facie,
there is sufficient substance available with the Department that
supply of Declaration Forms may jeopardise the collection of
sales tax from Dudadhar. When this is combined with the
withdrawal of a surety previously provided by Dudadhar, the
action of the Department is further strengthened. When the
volume of litigation prompted by Dudadhar is viewed, the
Department's decision not to supply Declaration Forms or
revalidate the two Declaration Forms already supplied can
scarcely be seen as obdurate or unreasonable.
12.   In Prince Plastics the Court had to consider the propriety
of insistence on compliance with certain conditions as a pre-
CWP 18054/2004                                      page 24 of 41

requisite for entertaining an Appeal. It observed as follows:-
             25. Despite having a good case a party may receive
      an unfavourable order/judgment. It may then not only
      suffer the discomfort of taking steps to have the order
      corrected in appeal, but may additionally have to comply
      with onerous pre-conditions for the hearing of the
      appeal. In Shyam Kishore -vs- Municipal Corporation of
      Delhi, (1993) 1 SCC 22, somewhat, similar pre-conditions
      for the disposal of an appeal against an assessment order
      had come up for consideration before the honourable
      Supreme Court. Under the MCD Act an appeal against
      the assessment cannot be heard without pre-deposit of
      the tax. It was held that the appellate authority has no
      jurisdiction to waive the condition of deposit or stay the
      collection of tax pending disposal of the appeal. The Apex
      Court     also  relied   that   despite   these    stringent
      requirements, the remedy of an appeal was nonetheless
      an    alternative   remedy    thereby   discouraging     the
      invocation of extraordinary powers of the High Court
      under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. As we
      have already mentioned, the impugned Rules merely
      implement this settled principle of law. In Shyam Kishore
      the plea that the provision for deposit of duty or penalty
      pending appeal whittles down the appellant's right of
      appeal and is, therefore, ultra vires did not find favour
      with the honourable Supreme Court. The Court relied on
      its previous observations in Vijay Prakash D. Mehta -vs-
      Collector of Customs (Preventive), Bombay [1989] 72
      STC 324(SC) : (1988) 4 SCC 402, viz., “right to appeal is
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 25 of 41

    neither an absolute right nor an ingredient of natural
    justice the principles of which must be followed in all
    judicial and quasi-judicial adjudications. The right to
    appeal is a statutory right and it can be circumscribed by
    the conditions in the grant”.        This position was once
    again reiterated in Gujarat Agro Industries Co. Ltd. -vs-
    Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad, AIR
    1999 SC 1818. It was again articulated in State of
    Haryana -vs- Maruti Udyog Ltd., [2001] 124 STC 285(SC)
    : AIR 2000 SC 2941 in the syntax of sales tax legislation,
    in these words:
            “There cannot be any dispute that right of
      appeal is the creature of the statute and has to be
      exercised within the limits and according to the
      procedure provided by law. It is filed for invoking the
      powers of a superior court to redress the error of the
      court below, if any. No right of appeal can be
      conferred except by express words. An appeal, for its
      maintainability, must have a clear authority of law.
      Sub-section (5) of section 39 of the Act vests a
      discretion in the appellate authority to entertain the
      appeal if it is filed within sixty days and the amount of
      tax assessed along with penalty and interest, if any,
      recoverable from the persons has been paid. The
      aforesaid    restriction   is   subject  to  the  proviso
      conferring discretion upon the appellate authority to
      dispense with the deposit of the amount only on proof
      of the fact that the appellant was unable to pay the
      amount. Before deciding the appeal, the appellate
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 26 of 41

        authority   affords   an    opportunity   to   the  party
        concerned to either pay the amount or make out a
        case for the stay in terms of proviso to sub-section (5)
        of section 39 of the Act. Once the conditions specified
        under sub-section (5) of section 39 are complied with,
        the appeal is born for being disposed of on merits
        after hearing both the sides”.
              This dicta is not confined only to taxation
        matters and applies with equal force even to civil
        appeals, as would be obvious on a reading of the
        decision in Kondiba Dagadu Kadam -vs- Savitribai
        Sopan Gujar, AIR 1999 SC 2213.
13.   Dudadhar had also filed CW 8392/2002 in this Court titled
Jagannath Dudadhar -vs- Commissioner of Sales Tax which was
decided by Judgment dated 25.2.2003 reported as [2004] 136
STC 235. After rejecting the plea for total waiver of pre-deposit
on   the   reasoning   that   the   Legislature   is  competent    to
circumscribe the right of an appeal including the terms spelt out
in Section 43(5) of the DST Act, the proviso to sub-section (5) was
invoked by the Division Bench which accordingly permitted the
credits in the sum of Rs.46,50,000/- stated to be due to
Dudadhar,      to   be   deducted     from    the    pre-deposit   of
Rs.5,08,40,000/-     against      the    assessed      demand      of
Rs.12,67,50,068/- for AYs 1998-1999(L), 1998-1999 (C) and 1999-
CWP 18054/2004                                          page 27 of 41

2000(L). The occasion for the writ petition was because the
Additional Commissioner(Appeals) had directed Dudadhar to
deposit 25 per cent of disputed tax and penalty as a condition
precedent for entertaining the Appeal.
14.   Meanwhile, in Appeal No.628/STT/92-93 the Sales Tax
Tribunal, Delhi reduced the surety amount from Rs.2,00,00,000/-
to Rs.15,00,000/- vide Orders dated 18.3.1993. It would be
relevant to recall that one of the sureties had withdrawn from this
engagement on the ground that the Signatory of the Surety was
not competent to bind the HUF. Even from this brief narration it
will be evident that whilst a labyrinth of litigation has been laid
out by Dudadhar, it nevertheless insists on furnishing of
Declaration Forms by the Department. The right of the State or
Department     for   collection  of   sales  tax   has   thus  been
complicatedly imperilled.     In our view as a party ascends the
hierarchy of appeals, the prospects of its success correspondingly
becomes slender. Therefore, such a party should ordinarily be
required to deposit the demand of tax. Governments cannot
function on promises to pay, or on sureties, or bank guarantees.
See Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Chandan Nagar, West
Bengal -vs- Dunlop India Ltd., AIR 1985 SC 330, the relevant
CWP 18054/2004                                         page 28 of 41

portion of which reads as follows:-
               7. Now coming to the facts of the present case,
        the    respondent,    Dunlop     India   Limited   is  a
        manufacturer of tyres tubes and various other rubber
        products. By a notification dated April 6, 1984 issued
        by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance
        (Department of Revenue) in exercise of the powers
        conferred by R.8(1) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944,
        tyres, falling under Item No.16 of the First Schedule to
        the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, were exempt
        from certain percentage of excise duty to the extent
        that the manufacturers had not availed themselves of
        the exemption granted under certain other earlier
        notifications. The Department was of the view that the
        Company was not entitled to the exemption as it has
        cleared the goods earlier without paying central excise
        duty, but on furnishing Bank Guarantees under various
        interim orders of courts. The Company claimed the
        benefit of the exemption to the tune of Rs.6.05 crores
        and filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court and
        sought an interim order restraining the central excise
        authorities from the levy and collection of excise duty.
        The learned Single Judge took the view that a prima
        facie case had been made out in favour of the Company
        and by an interim order allowed the benefit of the
        exemption to the tune of Rs.two crores ninety three
        lakhs and eighty five thousand for which amount the
        company was directed to furnish a Bank Guarantee,
        that is to say, the goods were directed to be released
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 29 of 41

      on the Bank Guarantee being furnished. An appeal was
      preferred by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise
      under clause 10 of the Letters Patent and a Division
      Bench of the Calcutta High Court confirmed the order
      of the learned single judge, but made a slight
      modification in that the Collector of Central Excise was
      given the liberty to encash 30% of the Bank Guarantee.
      The Assistant Collector of Central Excise has preferred
      this appeal by special leave. By our interim order dated
      Nov.15, 1984, we vacated the orders granted by the
      learned single judge as well as by the Division Bench.
      We gave two weeks' time to the respondent Company
      to file a counter. No counter has, however, been filed.
      Shri F.S. Nariman, learned counsel, however appeared
      for the respondent. We do not have the slightest doubt
      that the orders of the learned single judge as well as
      Division Bench are wholly unsustainable and should
      never have been made. Even assuming that the
      company had established a prima facie case, about
      which we do not express any opinion, we do not think
      that it was sufficient justification for granting the
      interim orders as was done by the High Court. There
      was no question of any balance of convenience being in
      favour of the respondent-Company. The balance of
      convenience was certainly in favour of the Government
      of India. Governments are not run on mere Bank
      Guarantees. We notice that very often some courts act
      as if furnishing a Bank Guarantee would meet the ends
      of justice. No governmental business or for that matter
CWP 18054/2004                                      page 30 of 41

         no business of any kind can be run on mere Bank
         Guarantees. Liquid cash is necessary for the running
         of a Government as indeed any other enterprise. We
         consider that where matters of public revenue are
         concerned, it is of utmost importance to realise that
         interim orders ought not to be granted merely because
         a prima facie case has been shown. More is required.
         The balance of convenience must be clearly in favour
         of the making of an interim order and there should not
         be the slightest indication of a likelihood of prejudice
         to the public interest. We are very sorry to remark that
         these considerations have not been borne in mind by
         the High Court and interim order of this magnitude had
         been granted for the mere asking. The appeal is
         allowed with costs.

15.    The conundrum which presents itself is whether this Court
should exercise its extraordinary powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India in these circumstances.    It will be recalled
that the Department had furnished five (5) ST-35/1 Declaration
Forms to the Petitioners in connection with its transactions with
BPCL, only three of which were used during the period of their
CWP 18054/2004                                         page 31 of 41

currency/validity. However, the remaining two Forms were
unauthorisedly used by Dudadhar in the subsequent Assessment
Year and, therefore, were not recognised by the Department. The
conduct of Dudadhar in these circumstances is contrived and
cunning as will be manifestly evident from the following
chronology. On 19.11.2001 it applied for five ST-35/1 Declaration
Forms which were supplied on 24.12.2001, specifically indicating
that these were in respect of transactions with BPCL in AY 2001-
2002. The Petitioner was fully aware of this stipulation or
restriction. On 9.9.2003 a Deficiency Memo was issued pursuant
to Dudadhar's application for issuance of Statutory Form for the
AYs 2001-2002 and 2002-2003. By Rejection Order dated
17.10.2003 the Department refused to issue Statutory Forms for
the   AYs   2001-2002   and    2002-2003    which  included   the
transactions covered by the misutilised two Declaration Forms in
question. These relevant facts have been suppressed in the Writ
Petition. After the Rejection Order, on 27.3.2004, the Petitioner
used   the   remaining  two   Declaration   Forms   [which  were
authorised to be used in AY 2001-2002 only] in relation to
transactions in the subsequent Assessment Year. By this time
Dudadhar had knowledge of the fact that the Department had
taken a decision not to supply Declaration Forms. It was quite
CWP 18054/2004                                      page 32 of 41

logical and, therefore, only to be expected that when these two
Declaration Forms were attempted to be used by BPCL for
seeking exemption, they would be rejected by the Department.
This is precisely what transpired on 29.3.2004. Accordingly,
BPCL deposited the sales tax for transactions sought to be
covered by these two Declaration Forms. Mr. Aurora has stated
that Dudadhar had further violated the law by attempting to use
the said two ST-35/1 Declaration Forms as ST-35 Forms.
16.   In these circumstances we find no merit in the contention of
Mr. Chawla that Dudadhar should have been put to prior notice
of the Department's decision to withdraw the efficacy of the said
two Declaration Forms. It is our opinion that there is no violation
of the principles of natural justice since Dudadhar had
knowledge of the fact that these two Declaration Forms were to
be used only for transactions in AY 2001-2002. A party seeking
equity must not transgress equity. There is merit in the
contention of Mr. Aurora that the proper course for Dudadhar to
have pursued was to surrender the two unutilised ST-35/1 Forms
and instead ask for their substitution or their revalidation, prior
to their user contrary to the express terms in which they were
issued to Dudadhar.     We cannot accept the contention of Mr.
CWP 18054/2004                                       page 33 of 41

Chawla that a party is automatically and absolutely entitled to
Declaration Forms if it enters into a transaction with a registered
dealer. We need do no more than refer to the ratio of Prince
Plastics. We are further unable to locate any bonafides in the
manner in which Dudadhar has used the subject two ST-35
Declaration Forms. Even assuming that Declaration Forms are
supplied for intended purchases, i.e. for transactions to be
completed in the future, there is no legal impropriety for the
Department to fix a period within which the Declaration Forms
must be used. Rule 8(2) of the DST Rules contemplates that a
selling dealer should not accept ST-1 Forms that have been
declared as invalid or obsolete by the Commissioner. Whilst
invalidity may   be     the  consequence     of   various   factors,
obsolescence is related entirely to time. The Concise Oxford
English Dictionary defines obsolete as -'no longer produced or
used; out of date'. Administrative exigencies may, therefore,
reasonably require the Department to lay down the periodicity
within which Declaration Forms must be used. Such stipulation
would normally not cause any prejudice to the dealer who can
always apply for fresh and current Declaration Forms by
surrendering obsolete or outdated ones. In the case in hand,
Dudadhar has taken law into its own hands by attempting to use
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 34 of 41

Declaration Forms ST-35/1 against their tenor by tampering and
interpolation. The consequence was that although BPCL has
challenged the refusal, it has deposited the sales tax which it
would have ordinarily charged from Dudadhar in the absence of
valid Declaration Forms. In similar fashion, in the absence of
Declaration Forms, Dudadhar can make further sales provided it
charges and recovers sales tax on these transactions. The amount
of tax paid would eventually be deductible or adjustable from the
tax collected from the consumer. Dudadhar is the distributor of
BPCL and further sells the petroleum products to retailers who
directly collect taxes from the consumer on each sale.       These
sales tax collections by the retailers are made by them on behalf
of the State and in no circumstances are they entitled to retain
them. Accordingly, if the distributor, namely Dudadhar, insists
on payments of sales tax from the retailers, the latter having
already recovered these amounts from the consumer, no party
would be put to financial loss. These factors should not be
ignored since by    not adhering to this procedure, there is the
foreboding likelihood of the collection and receipt by the State of
sales tax being severely jeopardised.

17.   It may be recalled that the vires of Rule 8 of the DST Rules,
1975 had been assailed in CW 3304/1997 titled Shri Krishna
Engineering Co. -vs- CST but the vires eventually came to be
upheld by the Apex Court in Shri Krishna. That apart, we must
highlight  the    changes  incorporated    by   Notification dated
11.2.1997 bearing No.F.4(36)/96-Fin.(G) into Rule 8(4)(c)(ii)
whereby the words “which the appellant admits to be due from
him and which is not in dispute” were replaced by the words “in
respect of which no order for installments or stay have been
obtained from the competent authority under the provisions of
law.”
18.   The Commissioner of Sales Tax filed CWP 9879/2004
which, on 20.7.2004, was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty
granted to file a Reference under Section 45 of the DST Act. The
Reference 1 & 2/STT/2004-05 was filed on 27.7.2004 as in
respect of Tribunal's Order dated 13.5.2004. The Registrar, Sales
Tax Appellate Tribunal has forwarded a Reference to this Court
on 12.10.2004 in respect of Appeal 18-19/STT/04-05 pertaining to
the issuance of statutory Declaration Forms (ST-35) for the AYs
2001-2002 and 2002-2003 and ST-35/1 Forms for 2002-2003. The
Reference to this Court has been numbered as STR-06/2004.
CWP 18054/2004                                        page 36 of 41

However, in August, 2004 the Rectification Proceedings initiated
by the CST against the Tribunal's Order dated 13.5.2004 were
filed and dismissed. Mr. Chawla has contended that the
Department has raised the same relief in several judicial
proceedings initiated by it, which the Department is not
permissible in law. Mr. Aurora has immediately conceded that the
prayer made in CWP 18054/2004 seeking quashing of the Order
dated 13.5.2004 passed by Respondent No.1 will not be pressed
since this prayer stands covered by the first prayer in the
Reference. He, however, has fervently pressed that the impugned
Order dated 1.10.2004 granting conditional stay, and Order dated
14.10.2004 modifying the Order dated 1.10.2004 have become
critical. It is in this complex and convoluted factual matrix that
the Department has declined either to issue two Forms in lieu of
ones already issued pertaining to AY 2002-2003, or to revalidate
these Forms, leading to the filing of CWP 11487/2005 which also
contains a prayer for restraining the Department from recovering
sales tax dues vide Assessment Order under Section 23(3) of the
DST Act.
19.    The amendments to the DST Rules have already been
adumbrated above. Prior to their amendment on 12.9.2001 they
CWP 18054/2004                                      page 37 of 41

envisaged and mandated depositing of the amount of tax assessed
or the penalty imposed by the Assessing Authority which the
appellant admitted to be due from him and which was not in
dispute. After the amendment to the Rules, payment/deposit of
the amount of tax assessed or the penalty imposed by the
Assessing Authority is essential unless orders for installments
thereon or for stay have been obtained from the Competent
Authority. In other words, prior to 12.9.2001 an appellant was
required only to pay or deposit the admitted tax, whereas, as the
law presently stands, the amount of tax and penalty must be
deposited as a pre-condition for the entertaining of the Appeal
unless it has been stayed by the Competent Authority. Therefore,
the Department would be justified in adopting a different stand
post 12.9.2001, namely, that it is now an irrelevant consideration
whether the Assessee admits any amount against the assessed tax
or penalty. The only relevant element is whether the Competent
Authority has stayed the assessment or fixed installments. In that
respect the Department would now be justified in not adhering to
the Orders dated 22.12.2001 requiring Dudadhar to file a surety
for Rs.50,00,000/- under the Local Act and Rs.10,00,000/- under
the Central Act. Mr. Chawla has failed to disclose any stay orders
or installment orders pertaining to the pending demands of sales
CWP 18054/2004                                       page 38 of 41

tax. As has been observed by the Apex Court in Shri Krishna
the sweep of Section 43(5) of the DST Act should not be curtailed
inasmuch as this provision prescribes that no appeal against the
order of assessment with or without penalty or against an order
imposing penalty shall be entertained unless such appeal is
accompanied by a satisfactory proof of the payment of tax with or
without penalty. In the absence of any orders envisaged in
Section 43(5) the Department would be fully justified in declining
to furnish statutory Declaration Forms. There are several
observations to the effect that the transactions of Dudadhar are
not bonafide; a surety previously provided has been withdrawn.
Most significantly, before us it has been conceded by Mr. Chawla
that Dudadhar is not in a position to provide additional security
in the form of Bank Guarantee. Mr. Aurora has been quick to
emphasise the fact that Dudadhar has on the one hand bought
an expensive car and on the other is pleading poverty and
penury. Therefore, in our opinion, there can be no wisdom in
directing the Department to furnish statutory Declaration Forms
exempting the payment of sales tax in circumstances where the
subsequent recovery of taxes may be rendered illusory. The
fundamental right to carry on a business is, no doubt, recognised
in Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India but it is not
CWP 18054/2004                                       page 39 of 41

protected to the extent that the business can be carried on
without payment of taxes and more startling to enable a party to
carry on business despite collecting indirect taxes which are not
forwarded by it to the State. We say this because if Declaration
Forms are to be issued by the Department to Dudadhar the
effect could thereafter be that sales may be made to parties
which either do not exist, or fail to deposit the amounts collected
by them from the consumer by way of sales tax. Issuance of
Declaration Forms, whether on 'C' Forms, ST-1 Forms, ST-35 or
ST-35/1 Forms cannot be claimed as of right. They are provided
by the Department to facilitate the collection of sales tax at the
ultimate point of sale. But this does not mean that the
Department must be compelled to issue them against their
fundamental interests. It further appears to us that this position
would remain the same regardless of whether the dealer is the
seller or the purchaser.
20.    We see no justification in entertaining CW 11487/2005 filed
by Dudadhar. It would be wholly inappropriate to invoke our
extraordinary powers in circumstances where serious and far-
reaching disputed questions of fact exist and where there is
adequate material for the Department to justify their stand in
CWP 18054/2004                                       page 40 of 41

declining to issue statutory Declaration Forms.
21.   For these very reasons the Department must succeed in CW
18054/2004 and in the circumstances detailed above the
impugned Order of the Appellate Tribunal, Sales Tax, dated
13.5.2004 is set aside as it may severely and irretrievably damage
the prospects of collection of sales tax from Dudadhar.
Subsequent Orders of the Appellate Tribunal, Sales Tax, dated
1.10.2004 and 14.10.2004 are also set aside.
22.   Dudadhar shall pay costs of these Petitions to the
Department, quantified at Rs.50,000/-, within four weeks from
today.
23.   All pending applications stand disposed of.
