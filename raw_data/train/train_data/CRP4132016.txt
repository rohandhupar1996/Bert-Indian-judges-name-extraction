       Date of hearing and Order          : 26.07.2017
                               JUDGMENT AND ORDER
           Heard Mr. R.C. Das, the learned counsel for the petitioners, Mrs. R.
Choudhury, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents No.1 to 3 and Mr.
S.P. Choudhury, the learned State Counsel appearing for the respondents No.4 to
7.
2)         From the copy of the judgment dated 23.12.1987, passed by the
learned Assistant District Judge, Dhubri, in T.S. No. 32/1983, the Respondents
No.1 and 2 are the plaintiffs in TS No. 32/1983. The suit was for declaration and
cancellation of sale deed, and 19 persons were arrayed as Defendants. The suit
was decreed as under –
           It is declared –
CRP 413/2016                                                                    Page 1 of 4

            (i)   That the plaintiffs along with the Defendants No.1 and 2 have
                  right, title, interest over the suit properties, as described in
                  Schedules-A and B, and
            (ii)  That the plaintiffs are entitled to get 7/16th share each in the suit
                  properties, and
            (iii) That the defendants No.1 and 2 have sold more than their shares
                  in the suit property and as such sale deeds are not binding on
                  the plaintiffs.
                  It is also directed that decree be sent to the Collector, Dhubri for
            making partition of the suit properties amongst the plaintiffs and
            defendants No.1 and 2 according to their shares (Plaintiffs 7/16th each
            and the defendants 1/16th each) as specifically determined in para-8
            above under Issue No.8.
3)          The present petitioners are the legal representatives of Dinesh
Chandra Das, who was arrayed as Defendant No.15.Some piece and parcel of
land were sold by the defendant No.1 to the defendant No.15. Being aggrieved
by the said judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court, he preferred
an appeal before the Court of Additional District Judge, Dhubri, which was
numbered as T.A. No. 9/1994. By first appellate judgment and decree dated
06.04.1995, the appeal of the petitioner’s predecessor- in- interest was allowed
and decreed and his land covered by Dag No. 140, Khatian No. 78 purchased
from defendants No.1 and 2 was ordered to stand excluded from partition. The
plaintiffs assailed the same by filing second appeal, which was numbered as S.A.
No. 101/95 and this court, by judgment dated 11.01.2001, allowed the appeal by
setting aside that part of the first appellate judgment by which the land of the
petitioner’s predecessor- in- interest (Dinesh Chandra Das), covered by Dag No.
140, Khatian No. 78 purchased from defendants No.1 and 2 was ordered to
stand excluded from partition.
CRP 413/2016                                                                       Page 2 of 4

4)          The grievance of the petitioners is that after bifurcation of Dhubri
District, one part of the decreetal land is within the District of Dhubri and one
part of the land now falls within the District of Kokrajhar. It is alleged that
despite reminders, the report from the Collector, Kokrajhar has not been received
and, as such, the petitioners, who are the legal representatives of defendant
No.15 is being compelled to endure the proceedings of T.Ex. Case No. 2/2002. It
is projected that the petitioners had filed Misc. (J) Case No. 59/2016 before the
learned executing court for certain reliefs. In this present application filed under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioners have prayed for a
direction to the learned executing court for early disposal of Misc. (J) Case No.
59/2016.
5)          In support of the present application, the petitioners have filed an
additional affidavit on 22.02.2017 and thereafter, they have also filed a second
additional affidavit on 21.07.2017. Mr. Ratan Chandra Das, Advocate, who is the
petitioner No.6 herein has preferred to argue in person. He also appears as the
counsel engaged by the remaining other 5 petitioners, who are all his brothers.
He has argued at length, taking this court to almost each and every document
filed by him. At this stage, it is not deemed necessary to burden this order with
his lengthy arguments.
6)          Per contra, the learned Counsel for the respondents No.1 to 3 has
advanced a short and summarized argument by submitting that the learned
executing court, by order dated 04.02.2017, which is annexed as Annexure-1 to
the additional affidavit filed by the petitioners on 22.02.2017, whereby the said
learned court allowed the Misc. (J) Case No. 59/2016, by permitting the legal
representatives of Late Dinesh Chandra Das to renovate or undertake
construction over the 10 lessas land in their possession at their own risk and cost
and the decree holders or their men and agents were temporarily restrained from
obstructing the present applicants (i.e. petitioners herein) from undertaking any
construction over the said land till final partition is affected. The same point is
CRP 413/2016                                                                     Page 3 of 4

also argued by the learned State Counsel appearing for the respondents No.4 to
7.
7)          In that view of the matter, as it is seen that the Misc. (J) Case No.
59/2016 has been disposed of by order dated 04.02.2017, this present
application is held to have become infructuous. Hence, it is dismissed.
8)          At this stage, the petitioners’ side has referred to the following case
citations as mentioned below. However, in view of the discussion above, the said
cases are not found to be of any assistance to the petitioner under the facts and
circumstances of this case. The cases are: (i) K.P. Ranga Rao vs. K.V.
Venkatesham & Ors., (2015) 13 SCC 514, (ii) Harshad Chiman Lal Modi vs. DLF
Universal Ltd. & Another, (2005) 7 SCC 791, (iii) Ouseph Mathai & Ors. vs. M.
Abdul Khadir, (2002) 1 SCC 319, (iv) Pathumma and Ors. vs. Kuntalan Kutty &
Ors., (1981) 3 SCC 589, (v) Mannappa Manikappa Sheded & Ors. vs.
Bhaskhrappa A Bhasana & Ors., AIR 1978 Karnataka 113, (vi) Keshav Deo
Tulshan vs. Jagadish Prasad Tulsha, AIR 1973 Calcutta 83 and (vii) In the matter
of District Judge, Puri (Petitioner), AIR 1971 Orissa 89.
9)          Before parting with the records, it is deemed fit to record appreciation
for Mrs. R. Choudhury, the learned counsel for the respondents No.1 to 3, who
had intervened in the midst of the argument of the petitioners’ side to point out
about the disposal of the said misc. case and thus, prevented this court from
hearing further unnecessary arguments from the petitioners’ side. As the
petitioner No.6, who had argued in person, is a practicing Advocate, I leave it to
his wisdom to ponder on the point whether it was proper for him to argue at
such a length on an otherwise infructuous matter.
