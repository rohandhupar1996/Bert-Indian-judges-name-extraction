                        the  Judgment   dated   09.03.2016    passed  by  the   High

                        Petition  No.   1288   of   2016.      Realizing  that   the
Reason:
                        disputes are matrimonial in nature, this Court took
                        several steps to see whether the parties can resolve

                                 2
their disputes amicably, including the dispute on the
custody of their child.        In the process, the parties
were referred to Mrs. Sadhana Ramachandran, a trained
mediator, especially in matrimonial disputes.
3.  We   are  happy    to   note   that   the   parties  have
entered  into   a   mutual   settlement.      The  Settlement
Agreement dated 27.07.2018 has been duly signed by
the parties and their respective counsel and by the
learned mediator.
4.  In terms of the settlement, the appellant and the
respondent   have    filed    a   joint   application   under
Section 10A of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869.          We have
also interacted with the parties and we are convinced
that they have taken a conscious decision to part as
friends.      Having    regard     to   the   background   of
litigations between the parties, we are of the view
that this is a fit case to invoke our jurisdiction
under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and
pass orders on the application filed under Section
10A of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869.
5.  Accordingly, the petition for divorce on mutual
consent  filed    under   Section   10A   is  allowed.    The
marriage between the appellant – Meera V. Mathew and
the respondent – Vivek K. John is dissolved by way of

                                 3
a decree of divorce on mutual consent.              The parties
shall   be  bound    by  the  terms    of   settlement.       The
appellant and the respondent will keep in mind that
though they have severed their marital relationship,
for their child - Neil, Vivek John is his father and
Meera Mathew mother for ever.          The child is entitled
to the love and affection, protection and guidance of
both the parents and their families.            The child also
has a duty to respect, love and reciprocate the love
and   affection     from   both    the    parents    and    their
families.
6.  This    appeal    is  disposed     of   in   terms   of   the
Settlement Agreement dated 27.07.2018.            The agreement
shall form part of the decree.            As the parties are
agreeable    for   extension    of   six    months’   time    for
discharging    the   obligations    under    Clause   6   of  the
Agreement, the time is extended by six months from
today.
7.  We    record    our   sincere    appreciation       for   the
strenuous efforts taken by Mrs. Sadhana Ramachandran,
learned mediator, to bring out the settlement between
the parties who have been in litigation for quite
some time before different courts.
