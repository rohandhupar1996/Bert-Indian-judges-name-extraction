         P R E S E N T:
                THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE INDRAJIT MAHANTY.
                                          &
                  THE HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA.
            Date of hearing: 25.11.2014          Date of Judgment: 29.11.2014
I. Mahanty, J.     This writ application in the nature of habeas corpus has
         been filed by the petitioner-Prasant @ Kalia Sundray, inter alia,

                                  2
seeking to challenge his detention under Section-3(2) of the National
Security Act, 1980.
2.        Shorn of unnecessary detail suffice it is to note herein that,
the petitioner has been detained on 1 st of March, 2014 under
Section-3(2) of the National Security Act, 1980 and till date, he is
under jail custody at the Special Jail, Bhubaneswar. The petitioner
was served with a copy of the detention order on 03.03.2014
purportedly without enclosing necessary documents basing upon
which the charges had been made.
          On   11.03.2014,     the   petitioner  has    submitted    his
representation to the State Government, Central Government as well
as to the N.S.A. Advisory Board through the Superintendent of Special
Jail, Bhubaneswar. The State Government on 28.03.2014 has
forwarded the representation of the petitioner along with the para-wise
comments to the Central Government as well as to the N.S.A. Advisory
Board. The Central Government in the Ministry of Home Affairs
received the representation of the detenu on 04.04.2014. Thereafter
on 10.04.2014 the State Government has rejected the detenu’s
representation but failed to communicate the same to the petitioner
and on 11.04.2014, the Central Government in the Ministry of Home
Affairs has also rejected the representation and sends a copy of the
same to the petitioner through post. On 20.04.2014, the petitioner
has   received  the  rejection   order  of   the Central   Government.

                                  3
Ultimately, the order of rejection of the petitioner’s representation by
the State Government was also communicated to the petitioner on
21.04.2014.
3.        The aforesaid facts and dates are not in dispute. Although
various contentions were raised in the pleadings as well as in course
of hearing, learned counsel for the petitioner confined his arguments
to the alleged undue delay caused by the State Government and the
Central Government in dealing with the representation of the
petitioner.
          Mr. K.P. Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that   it is  not  in  controversy    that  the   petitioner  made   his
representation to the State Government, Central Government and
N.S.A. Advisory Board on 11.03.2014 and the State Government
forwarded the same to the Central Government as well as to the N.S.A.
Advisory Board only on 28.03.2014 i.e after a period of delay of 17
days. Thereafter, although the State Government purportedly rejected
the petitioner’s representation on 10.04.2014, orders thereof were
communicated to the petitioner only on 21.04.2014. Insofar as the
representation to the Central Government is concerned, it is
submitted that although, the Central Government received the
petitioner’s representation (sent through the State Government) on
04.04.2014 along with the para-wise comments of the State,
admittedly    the   Central   Government     ultimately    rejected  the

                                   4
representation of the petitioner on 11.04.2014 which was received by
the petitioner only on 20.04.2014.
4.        Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that neither in the
affidavit of the State Government nor in the affidavit of the Central
Government have any explanation been given as to the delay caused
in dealing with the petitioner’s representation and in this respect
placed reliance upon a judgment of this Bench in the case of Bikash
Munda vs. State of Odisha & Ors., 2014(I) ILR-CUT-889.
5.        In the aforesaid judgment this Court referring the judgment
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the cases of Aslam, Ahmed Zahire
Ahmed Shaik vs. Union of India and others, AIR 1989 SC 1403,
Smt. Khatoon Begum Vs. Union of India and others, AIR 1981 SC
1077, Saleh Mohammed vs. Union of India and others, AIR 1981
SC 111, Noor Salman Makani vs. Union of India & Ors. AIR 1994
SC 575 and Smt. Pebam Ningol Mikoi Devi vs. State of Manipur
and Ors., (2010) 47 OCR (SC) 684 as well as the judgment of this
Court in the cases of Bijaya Parida vs. State of Orissa and others,
2006 (II) OLR 591 and Shanina Begum vs. State of Orissa and
others, 2000(2) Crimes 424 concluded as follows:
                    “Law is well settled that the representation
          of the detenu under the Act must be attended to
          promptly, as the same infringes the fundamental
          rights of the detenu guaranteed under the Article
          22 of the Constitution.”

                                             5
        6.           In view of the aforesaid authoritative pronouncement as
        noted hereinabove, there has been unexplained and arbitrary delay of
        17 days by the State Government in forwarding the detenu-petitioner’s
        representation to the Central Government and, consequently, there
        has also been unexplained delay by the State Government as well as
        by the Central Government in dealing with the representation made
        by the detenu-petitioner. Therefore, since the representation of the
        detenu-petitioner has not been dealt with or attended to promptly, the
        same infringes the fundamental rights of the detenu-petitioner
        guaranteed under Article 22 of the Constitution.
        7.           In view of the above, this writ application is allowed and the
        order of detention of the petitioner dated 1 st March, 2014 passed by
        the Commissioner of Police, Bhubaneswar-Cuttack (opposite party
        No.2) under Anenxure-2 is quashed and the detenu-petitioner be set
        at liberty forthwith, if his detention is no longer required in connection
        with any other case.
                                                     ……………….…………
                                                        I.Mahanty, J.
B.N. Mahapatra, J.          I agree.
                                                   ……………………………
